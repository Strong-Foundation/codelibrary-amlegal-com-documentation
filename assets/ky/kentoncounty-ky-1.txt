parcel without a hearing or approval of the full Service Fee Appeals Board so

requested by the property owner in their notice of appeal. In the event the
County Treasurer does not, or is unable to reclassify the parcel under his
limited authority herein, the Board will consider the evidence presented by the
property owner along with any public records of the Property Valuation
Administrator, aerial maps, site photographs, building plans and permits,
surveys, plats, deeds, official documents, advertisements, site visits, or any
other evidence which may aid in the determination of the classification or
assessment of a parcel.
      (4)   Reclassification or reassessment of any parcel pursuant to an
appeal under this section shall be done by a majority vote of the members
present excepting therefrom any reclassification based on an initial review of
the Kenton County Treasurer or his designee under this section.
   (O)   All fees collected by the Kenton County Sheriff shall be forwarded to
the Kenton County Communications Board on a timely basis, as determined by the
Judge/Executive pursuant to executive order. The County Clerk and Sheriff shall

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 37.01 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   This chapter of the Administrative Code constitutes the Kenton County
Procurement Code and covers the purchasing policies by which the Kenton County
Fiscal Court, its employees and its agents, shall be obligated to operate.
   (B)   A purchasing manual has also been developed as a tool to be used by
county employees at all levels to guide them through the approved purchasing
policies. The manual covers the “how to” aspects of county purchasing and has
been published separately. The manual is not intended to be a policy statement,
and if any part of the manual conflicts in any way whatsoever with the
Administrative Code, the terms and definitions of the Administrative Code will
govern.
   (C)   Statement of public policy.
      (1)   Public employment is a public trust.
      (2)   It is the policy and purpose of this code to promote and balance
the objective of protecting government integrity and of the facilitation,
recruitment and retention of personnel needed by county government and public
agencies, by proscribing essential conflicts of interest without creating
unnecessary barriers to public service, and by facilitating development of fair
and competitive access to local public agency purchasing by responsible
contractors.
      (3)   Employees and officials must discharge their duties and
responsibilities fairly and impartially. They should also maintain a standard
of conduct that will inspire public confidence in the integrity of county
government of all local public agencies.
   (D)   Purpose of this chapter. The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe
specific standards to guide public officials and employees in the conduct of
their offices or employment, and to proscribe improper conduct to the extent to
which it may be sufficiently described to enable statutory prohibitions against
it to be properly enforced. It is at the same time recognized that, under a
free government, it is both necessary and desirable that all citizens should
have certain specific interests in the decisions of government, and that the
activities and conduct of public officers and employees should not be unduly
circumscribed.

Procurement Code, all pursuant to KRS 68.005(d) (County Administrative Code).

proper performance of the procurement functions.

or department heads to award any contract in excess of the maximum allowed by
law, without requiring use of a procurement process as set forth herein.
   (E)   The Judge/Executive shall have purchasing authority to make individual
purchases up to the limit set forth in division (G) of this section, provided
it is a lawful expenditure, its procurement has complied with the procedures
set forth herein, and sufficient and appropriate funds for the expenditure have
been made within the proper budget allocation.
   (F)   No procurement shall be made for an amount the exceeds the sum
budgeted and appropriated for the procurement by the Fiscal Court.

commitments are made, even if individual purchases fall under the purchase
authority in division (E) of this section. For purposes of this section only,
ONE PROJECT is defined as expenditures having a common component or nexus such
that a reasonable conclusion would be that all expenditures further the same
goal or initiative.

interest of the county. The reasons therefor shall be made part of the contract
file. Each solicitation issued by the county shall state that it may be
canceled, and that any bid or proposal may be rejected, in whole or in part,
for good cause, when in the county’s best interest. The reasons for rejections
shall be provided in writing upon request to unsuccessful bidders or offerors,
and shall be set forth in Fiscal Court minutes.
   (K)   Non-responsiveness. If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have
been awarded a contract is found non-responsive, a written determination of
non-responsiveness, setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared
by the Judge/Executive or his or her designee. The unreasonable failure of a
bidder or offeror to promptly supply information in connection with an inquiry
may be grounds for a determination of non-responsiveness with respect to a
bidder or offeror. The final determination shall be made part of the contract
file and shall be made a public record.
   (L)   Right of nondisclosure. In the instance of a request for

an agency from which the Fiscal Court may receive funds, including, but not
limited to, state and federal agencies.

time set for opening;
      (2)   The bidder can demonstrate from worksheets or other supporting
documents that a major, grievous error has been made in preparation of the bid

§ 37.30 EVALUATION AND AWARDS.
   (A)   Following the bid opening, the Purchasing Manager, the department head
of the procuring department, and others as may be designated by the Fiscal
Court, shall review all bids for compliance with the specifications, terms and
conditions.
   (B)   If required, bidders may be asked to clarify or explain, in writing,
any matter contained in the bids for which the Judge/Executive, or his or her
designee, feels the need for clarification or explanation. Any bidder who fails
to provide such written clarification or explanation, upon request within a
reasonable amount of time, shall not be considered for award. The written
clarification or explanation of a bid shall be incorporated in, and become a
part of, any contract awarded on the basis of that bid.
   (C)   When compliance is determined, the Purchasing Manager shall submit his
or her recommendation concerning the final disposition of the bids (i.e., award
the lowest or best bid and reject all others, reject all bids and rebid, and
the like) to the Fiscal Court at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
   (D)   The Judge/Executive, upon advice to the Fiscal Court in open session,
may waive formalities of the procurement methods provided herein, and establish
conditions under which incomplete bids, or bids not necessarily the lowest bid,
may be considered if it is determined that the waiver is in the best interest
of the Fiscal Court.
   (E)   Efforts will be made to solicit participation of locally-owned,
minority-owned, female-owned and small businesses, where feasible. The county,
at its discretion, may provide a 5% price advantage to vendors owned and
operated within the county, meaning that county vendors submitting prices 5%
higher than that of their non-local competition may be considered as providing
low bids. Vendors located outside of the county, but owned and operated in
Northern Kentucky (those counties associated with the Northern Kentucky Area
Development District), may receive a 2% advantage over other non-local bidders.
(Ord. 120.9, passed 8-24-99; Am. Ord. 121.42, passed 10-27-20)
§ 37.31 AWARD OF CONTRACTS.

price or the lowest evaluated bid price, as designated in the invitation to
bid.
   (B)   If it is determined that no satisfactory bid has been received, all
bids may be rejected by the Fiscal Court. The basis for rejection of the bids
and subsequent action taken with respect to the invitation for bids shall be
recorded in the Fiscal Court minutes.
(Ord. 120.9, passed 8-24-99; Am. Ord. 121.42, passed 10-27-20)
§ 37.32 CONTRACT SECURITY.
   (A)   The Fiscal Court may at its discretion require a performance bond in
the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, certified check or other guarantee
from vendors, accepting liability and guaranteeing that the bidder will not
withdraw the bid, as stated in the specifications of the invitation for bids or
the invitation for proposals.
   (B)   Every contractor to whom it is proposed to award a contract for
construction services costing more than $25,000 shall provide, prior to the
commencement of the delivery of goods or services under such a contract,
security to the Fiscal Court as obligee in a penal sum equal to 100% of the
estimated contract price.
   (C)   Regardless of the form of security, in no case shall the aggregate
security for the completion of the project be less than 100% of the contract
price.
   (D)   The County Judge/Executive, or his or her designee, with the advice
and consent of the County Attorney, shall be the final arbiter of whether the
security is adequate.
(Ord. 120.9, passed 8-24-99; Am. Ord. 121.42, passed 10-27-20)
§ 37.33 PURCHASE OF SERVICES.
   (A)   Policy. It is the policy of the county to publicly announce all
requirements for the purchase of services, as defined in §
37.02, and to negotiate contracts for these services on the basis of
demonstrated competence and qualification for the type of services required,
and at fair and reasonable prices. The county may utilize a request for
qualification process (RFQ) for projects over $300,000.
   (B)   Services selection committee.
      (1)   In the procurement of services, the County Purchasing Officer shall
encourage firms engaged in the lawful practice of their profession to submit a
statement of qualifications and performance data. This RFQ may be done in
advance so as to maintain a standing list of qualified firms at the time of
need for a specific project. A Review and Selection Committee, comprised of the
Deputy County Judge, the County Treasurer, the County Purchasing Officer and
one person from the using department, shall be established. The Judge/Executive
may add other persons to the Review Committee as seen fit to provide more
expertise for selection of a firm for a specialized project.
      (2)   The Selection Committee shall evaluate current statements of
qualifications and performance data already on file with the County Purchasing
Department, together with those that may be submitted
by other firms regarding a proposed project. The Selection Committee shall
conduct discussions with no less than three firms regarding the project and
relative utility of alternative methods of approach for furnishing the required
services, and then shall select therefrom, in order of preference, based upon
criteria established and published by the Selection Committee, no less than
three of the firms deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the
services required.
      (3)   Once the Selection Committee has selected the three best qualified
firms through the RFQ process, then final selection of a firm shall commence by
advertisement of a request for proposals (RFP). The Selection Committee may
require price data to be submitted with the RFP or negotiate pricing following
selection of the best proposal.
      (4)   The Committee shall negotiate a contract with the firm it
determines the best qualified, in its sole judgment, for the services being
purchased at compensation, which the Committee determines in writing to be fair
and reasonable to the county. In making this decision, the Committee shall take
into account the estimated value, the scope, the complexity and the
professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the Committee be
unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be best
qualified, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The
Committee shall then undertake negotiations with the second-best-qualified
firm. Failing accord with the second-best-qualified firm, the Committee shall
formally terminate negotiations. The Committee shall then undertake
negotiations with the third-best-qualified firm. Should the Committee be unable
to negotiate a contract at a fair and reasonable price with any of the selected
firms, the Committee shall select additional firms in order of their competence
and qualifications, and continue negotiations in accordance with this section
until an agreement is reached.
      (5)   At the conclusion of negotiations that result in a contract, the
Selection Committee shall document how it used the evaluation factors in the
RFP to select the best-qualified suppliers, and the principal elements of
negotiations. This information shall be included in the contract file, which
becomes public information.
   (C)   Request for proposals (RFP).  A RFP should include the following
parts:
      (1)   A work statement or performance specification;
      (2)   A time frame in which the work is to be completed;
      (3)   Specific criteria to be used in evaluating the proposal;
      (4)   When, where and how detailed specifications maybe obtained;
      (5)   Required time and place for the submission and opening of offers;
      (6)   A requirement that the offeror provide the following information:
         (a)   An understanding of the problem, the work to be done or the
program; and the approach to be used to achieve the objectives, including
detailing of tasks involved in the offeror’s approach;
         (b)   A verifiable milestone list, if not specified in the RFP;
         (c)   Facility and capability data not otherwise included in the RFQ.
      (7)   All written proposals received by the county in response to an RFP
shall be kept secure and unopened until the date and time set for opening.
      (8)   Proposals inadvertently opened shall be identified in front of at
least two witnesses, noted by all witnesses on the envelope, and re-sealed
until the advertised time to open proposals.
      (9)   Proposals shall be opened on the date and time set for opening. It
shall be the offeror’s responsibility to assure that the proposal is submitted
to the county before the advertised receipt time.
      (10)   Proposals being evaluated under the RFP process or competitive
negotiations shall not be subject to full public inspection until negotiations
between the county and all offerors have been concluded and a contract awarded.
However, the Selection Committee may determine what parts, if any, of a
proposal may be released for public inspection, provided the release does not
impede the negotiation process or give an unfair advantage to one or more
offerors.
(Ord. 121.42, passed 10-27-20)
§ 37.34 COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATION.
   (A)   Competitive negotiations may be used for a procurement when:
      (1)   The particular procurement is of such a complex nature or includes
such technical detail that specifications cannot be fairly and objectively
prepared to permit competition by sealed bids; or
      (2)   The particular procurement is for high-technology equipment
available from a limited number of sources of supply, and for which
specifications cannot reasonably be prepared except by reference to the
manufacturer’s specifications for the required equipment; or
      (3)   The Judge/Executive, or his or her designee, determines in writing
that favorable conditions permitting contracting by competitive negotiation are
present.
   (B)   When it is determined in writing that competitive negotiation is
necessary or appropriate to carry out a particular procurement, competitive
negotiations shall commence by advertisement of a request for written proposals
(RFP).
   (C)   The Judge/Executive, or his or her designee, shall determine in
writing, based upon individual review, those proposals/offers received from
responsible offerors that constitute a reasonable basis for
negotiation. Each such offeror shall be contacted informally and a meeting
shall be scheduled for discussion of the offeror’s proposals.
   (D)   Discussion need not be conducted under the following circumstances:
      (1)   Where such prices are fixed by law or regulation, except that
consideration shall be given to competitive terms and conditions;
      (2)   Where time of delivery or performance will not permit discussions;
      (3)   Where it is clear from prior experience with that particular
supply, service or construction item, that acceptance of an initial offer
without discussion would result in fair and reasonable prices, and the request
for proposals notifies all offerors of the possibility that award may be made
on the basis of initial offers.
   (E)   Discussions with bidders shall be held informally, orally, in writing,
or both orally and in writing, as determined by the Judge/Executive, or his or
her designee, to be most advantageous to the Fiscal Court.
   (F)   After discussions with all responsible offerors have been concluded
and it is determined that no acceptable proposal has been submitted, any or all
proposals may be rejected and new proposals may be requested, as provided in
these regulations, on the basis of the same or revised terms, or the
procurement may be abandoned.
   (G) The Judge/Executive, or his or her designee, shall recommend the
successful offeror to the Fiscal Court.

§ 37.35 MULTI-STEP SEALED BIDDING.
   When it is believed that competitive bidding would produce the best prices,
yet insufficient information exists to describe the required product or
service, an invitation for bids may be issued.
   (A)   Requirement for bidders to submit unpriced technical proposals.
   (B)   Determine acceptable proposals and negotiate with the almost-
acceptable suppliers to improve their proposals.
   (C)   Create invitation for bid (IFB) and allow acceptable bidders to submit
sealed-bid prices.
   (D)   Purchasing holds a public bid opening and tabulates the bids. Fiscal
Court awards contract to the low bid.
(Ord. 120.9, passed 8-24-99; Am. Ord. 121.42, passed 10-27-20)
§ 37.36 NON-COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATIONS.
   (A)   Non-competitive negotiations may be used only after a written
determination by the Judge/Executive, or his or her designee, that at least one
of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   There is only a single source (sole source) within a reasonable
geographic area; or
      (2)   The contract is for perishable items; or
      (3)   The contract is for replacement parts, where the value of the parts
represents a fraction of the worth of the item(s) being repaired or maintained;
or
      (4)   The contract is for proprietary items for resale; or
      (5)   The contract is for group life insurance, group health and accident
insurance, group professional liability insurance, workers compensation
insurance, or unemployment insurance; or
      (6)   The contract is for a purchase of supplies at reduced prices that
will afford a purchase at savings to the Fiscal Court.
   (B)   Upon successful negotiation, the Judge/Executive, or his or her
designee, after affirmative vote of the Fiscal Court, shall authorize the award
of a contract if for under $30,000 total value or if authorized by the Fiscal
Court. The Fiscal Court may ratify the contract so authorized by the Judge/
Executive or his or her designee.
   (C)   Upon successful negotiation, the Judge/Executive, or his or her
designee, shall recommend the awarding of a contract if for more than $30,000
total value, subject to the approval of the Fiscal Court.
(Ord. 120.9, passed 8-24-99; Am. Ord. 121.42, passed 10-27-20)
§ 37.37 SMALL PURCHASE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Judge/Executive, or his or her designee, shall first determine the
need for any item required and whether or not the contract is for less than the
maximum amount allowed by law without required use of a formal-bid process.
   (B)   Small purchases are those procurements not exceeding the amount of
$30,000, established by law or regulation, for a formal-bid process.
Administrative costs for small, low-dollar-value purchases can be minimized by
utilizing some of the following practices:
      (1)   State-centralized stores;
      (2)   Petty cash fund;
      (3)   Telephone requests for quotes;
      (4)   Simple, handwritten, request-for-quote forms;
      (5)   Requirements or blanket-type orders combining similar or like low-
dollar-value items; or,
      (6)   Travel requests.
   (C)   Procurement requirements shall not be parceled, split, divided or
purchased over a period of time in order to avoid dollar limitations.
   (D)   The Purchasing Manager shall obtain three price quotes from vendors
and select the one most advantageous to the Fiscal Court that meets the needs
of the user groups, except when the cost of the product or service is less than
$500.
   (E)   The Purchasing Manager shall maintain records of all small purchases
made by vendor and type of product or service.
   (F)   A PRE-QUALIFIED VENDOR is defined as a source of recurring small
purchases that is established through taking price quotes and market analysis
to determine a source for items that individually would not have to be bid, but
collectively would exceed the bid limit. The analysis shall determine, through
a system of quotes and/or bids, the lowest-price source for the combined items
authorized to be purchased at the source. This process will greatly facilitate
the procurement of recurring purchases at the most economical price to the
county.
   (G)   Purchasing cards are available for prior-approved use and small
purchases under $200. The Judge/Executive, or his or her designee, will make
the decision as to who receives a purchasing card as specified in the Kenton
County Fiscal Court Purchasing Card User Manual.
   (H)   In the event an authorized employee makes an unauthorized purchase
with a county purchasing card, that employee shall be personally liable for the
purchase and may be subject to disciplinary action, including, but not limited
to, repayment of that purchase.

others to make emergency procurements when there exists a threat to public
health, welfare or safety under emergency conditions; provided that such
emergency procurements shall be made with such competition as is practicable
under the circumstances. A written determination of the basis for the emergency
and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the
contract file.

§ 37.39 APPROPRIATIONS.
   (A)   The Fiscal Court shall not award a contract for any procurement when
the contract price would exceed the funds budgeted for the procurement by the
legislative body.
   (B)   If all bids received in response to an invitation to bid exceed the
amount appropriated for the procurement, and sufficient additional funds are
not authorized to permit an award to the lowest responsive and responsible
bidder, the Judge/Executive, or his or her designee, may proceed with a
competitive-negotiations process, may reissue an invitation for bids, or may
cancel the procurement.
   (C)   An invitation for bids or a request for proposals may be advertised in
anticipation of an appropriation, provided the invitation or request clearly
states that funds for the anticipated procurement, while anticipated, have not
been appropriated.

equipment or services for a period that exceeds the fiscal year, provided the
contract permits cancellation without penalty in the event that funds for the

responsibility to comply with any and all procurement requirements imposed by
an agency from which the Fiscal Court may receive funds, including, but not
limited to, state and federal agencies.

§ 70.27 REQUEST FOR HEARING.
   (A)   The owner of a motor vehicle which has been impounded pursuant to this
subsection, or other person entitled to possession, may challenge the validity
of such impoundment and may request in writing a hearing before the Parking
Violation Hearing Officer. The hearing shall be conducted within ten business
days of the date of the request unless the owner or other person entitled to
possession waives the limitation or the county establishes good cause for such
delay. The county shall retain possession of the vehicle pending the hearing,
unless the owner or other person claiming right of possession posts a bond in
an amount equal to the fines and fees as of the date of the hearing request, or
$75 whichever is less. If the owner or other person claiming possession of the
vehicle is unable to pay the amount of the bond, the hearing shall be held

person requests or agrees to a continuance.
   (B)   No less than five days prior to the date set for hearing, the county
shall notify the person requesting the hearing of the date, time, and place of
the hearing. In the case of hearing required to be held within 72 hours of the

hearing shall be informed at the time of his request, or as soon thereafter as
is practicable, of the date and time of the hearing.
   (C)   Any person who refuses or, except for good cause, fails to appear at
the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have conceded on his
and the owner's behalf the validity of the impoundment.

shall determine whether the impoundment was valid and reasonable. Where it has
not been established that the impoundment was justified, an order releasing the
vehicle shall be entered. All fines and fees paid or amounts posted as bond
because of the impoundment of the vehicle shall be returned. Where it has been
established that the impoundment was justified, the Hearing Officer shall
uphold the impoundment and condition the release of the vehicle upon the
payment of all fines and fees accruing thereto. If bond has been posted as
security for release of the vehicle, the bond shall be forfeited to the county.

to be paid by the owner of the vehicle to the county. The Hearing Officer shall
furnish the owner or person appearing on the owner's behalf with a copy of its

Kenton District Court within seven days of the Hearing Officer's determination.
The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a copy of the
Hearing Officer's order in the same manner as any civil action. The action
shall be tried de novo and the burden shall be on the county to establish that
the impoundment was justified. If the court finds that the impoundment was
justified the owner shall be ordered to pay all fees and fines accruing as of
the date of the judgment. If the court finds that the impoundment was not
justified, the county shall be ordered to release the vehicle, if applicable,
and to return all fines and fees paid as a result of the impoundment.

§ 91.02 DISCARDED ITEMS ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY PROHIBITED.
   (A)   Discarded items on person's own property.
      (1)   The County Fiscal Court finds that the practice of allowing
discarded items to remain on an owner's property, constitutes a detriment to
the welfare and convenience of the resident of the county. Such discarded items
detract from the appearance of the county and affect the economic development
of the county. Therefore, it is the public policy of this county to prohibit
the keeping of discarded items on private property within the limits of the
county, and such discarded items are hereby declared to be public nuisances.
      (2)   Any law enforcement officer who knows, sees or otherwise has
knowledge that a property owner has allowed a discarded item to remain on his
property in violation of this chapter, shall issue a citation to such property
owner ordering him to appear before the district court.
   (B)   Discarding items on property of another prohibited. No person shall
place, leave, deposit or otherwise undertake to dispose of any discarded item
upon any private property or upon any public property or right-of-way in the
county. Any person whose property lies within the county and on whose property
a discarded item is disposed may file a complaint with the County Police.
   (C)   Complaint investigation.
      (1)   Upon the initial receipt of a complaint, whether officer or citizen
initiated, the investigating county police officer shall make an inspection of
the specified property, from complainant's adjacent or abutting property, or a
public street, road or park. If a violation is observed, photographs shall be
taken from the officer's observation point and the officer shall make contact
with the property owner.
      (2)   The police officer shall provide the violator with a copy of the
county ordinance, explain the purpose of the ordinance, the possible penalties,
outline the corrective action that needs to be taken within the next 30 days,
and issue a warning citation for the violation.
      (3)   After the 30-day warning period, the officer shall revisit the
property to verify that corrective actions have been completed. If the
violations have been satisfactorily corrected, the case shall be closed. If, in
the officer's opinion, the problem has not been fully corrected but the owner
has made significant progress, the officer may extend the cleanup period
through the issuance of another 30-day warning citation.
      (4)   If the re-inspection indicates to the officer that the property
owner has not acted in good faith in complying with the provisions of this
section, the officer shall issue a state citation to the property owner citing
them to district court for violation of this section.

designee, shall issue an order to the property owner to remove the discarded
items as described in this chapter, from the property or premises, the subject
of the violation. The order shall allow the property owner ten days to remove
any discarded items from the subject property. The ten-day period shall
commence with the date of mailing of the order by certified mail to the
property owner. Removal of discarded items by the property owner will be at the
property owners expense. After ten days have expired and all discarded items
have not been removed, then in that event, the county shall have the authority
to enter upon private property of the convicted offender and remove any and all
discarded items therefrom. The cost to the county of removing the discarded
items from the private property shall be at the property owners' expense. Upon
removal of the discarded items from the private property by the county, the
county shall cause a billing to be forwarded to the property owner to reimburse
the county for the cost of removal of the discarded items. The property owner
shall have ten days to pay the billing. The ten-day payment period shall
commence with the date of the billing. If the bill is not paid within said ten-
day period, the county may at its option place a lien on the real property with
the County Clerk, for the actual cost of removal of the discarded items from
the property. The lien would bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The
lien shall be enforceable as a real property lien under Kentucky law, including

oil which creates a hazard to traffic on a roadway is deemed to be a reportable
quantitity and must be reported to the administering authority.
   (D)   Higher reportable quantity. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this section, the administering agency may designate a reportable quantity for
a hazardous material in excess of the quantity determined under this section if
the administering agency determines that the higher reportable quantity is
consistent with the purposes and objectives of this chapter.
   (E)   Releases to sanitary sewer system. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this section, any release of a hazardous material to a sanitary sewer system
which is prohibited under applicable pretreatment or other regulations of any
sanitation district operating within Kenton County governing discharges to the
sanitary sewer system shall be deemed to be discharged in reportable
quantities.

§ 95.08 DISPOSAL OF EXCAVATION MATERIAL.
   Any material removed from county right-of-way, shall be disposed of by the
applicant as directed by the Public Works Superintendent or his authorized
representative. If the material is needed on the county maintained highway
within a reasonable hauling distance it shall be used to improve the county
maintained highway. If the material is not needed by the Public Works
Department, the Public Works Superintendent may allow the applicant to dispose
of it on the applicant's property. In no case will the applicant be permitted
to place it on other private property for monetary gain.
(Ord. 620.1, passed 3-1-79; Am. Ord. 101.00, passed 6-13-95)

protect the public.
(Ord. 620.1, passed 3-1-79; Am. Ord. 101.00, passed 6-13-95)
Penalty, see § 95.99
§ 95.10 MAINTENANCE OF PERMITTED ENCROACHMENTS.
   (A)   Utilities on bridges. The applicant shall maintain the utility in good
condition at his own expense and shall paint or repaint exposed metal parts of
all lines where paint is used for the purpose of protection. This function
should be performed when conditions dictate or at the direction of the Public
Works Department.
   (B)   Maintenance of Private Entrances to County Road.
      (1)   The cost of private entrances connecting to a County road, either
residential or commercial, shall be borne by the permittee. Future maintenance
of such entrances shall not be the responsibility of the Public Works
Department except that the county will maintain the entrance from the edge of
pavement on the county's roadway to the edge of the roadway shoulder. The
maintenance of the remainder of the entrance within the county's right-of-way
will be borne by the property owner unless Public Works Department maintenance
or construction work has caused said entrance to require adjustment to meet the
county's work. Should the drainage pipe under a private entrance require
replacement in order to correct a drainage problem along the county road, the
costs for replacement may be borne by the Public Works Department provided the
entrance, including the drainage pipe, was originally constructed and
maintained to County standards.
      (2)   Maintenance of old or existing entrances.
         (a)   In individual cases where in the judgment of the Public Works
Superintendent a residential or farm entrance is causing damage to the roadway
or danger to the public, the Public Works Superintendent may authorize
maintenance work, including materials, to correct the problem.
         (b)   When a drainage structure has been previously approved by the
Public Works Department and it becomes inadequate to function properly, or when
it has been damaged by the Public Works Department, it may be replaced at the
expense of the Public Works Department. Entrances constructed in violation of
this policy shall be immediately removed where roadway drainage is affected.
         (c)   Private and commercial entrances which have been constructed for
three or more years, without the property owner being informed in writing that
his entrance is in violation of the County Public Works Department rules or
regulations, shall be treated as a properly permitted entrance as far as their
maintenance is concerned. This shall not be interpreted to give the property
owner the same rights as a properly permitted entrance as set forth in this
manual.
      (3)   Entrances existing prior to county maintenance. Private and
commercial entrances which were constructed prior to the Fiscal Court accepting
a road into the county-maintained system from another agent or agency shall be
considered as properly permitted entrances for all purposes.
      (4)   Public school entrances, exits, and pull-offs.
         (a)   The Public Works Department will maintain, at its expense, that
portion of public school entrances and exits (including all drainage
structures) which are located on the county's right-of-way.
         (b)   Those areas located on the county's right-of-way which have
developed, and will develop in the future as pull-offs, and deceleration and
acceleration lanes by school buses, will also be maintained at the expenses of
the Public Works Department.
      (5)   Industrial entrances. When improvements are necessary for entrances
to industrial facilities, the cost for them may in some instances be borne by
the Public Works Department, as allowed by Public Works Department policy on
industrial access roads. For these reasons, the Public Works Superintendent
shall contact the Fiscal Court to determine whether the Public Works
Department, or the permittee, shall bear the resulting costs, and whether such
additional improvements are necessary.
(Ord. 620.1, passed 3-1-79; Am. Ord. 101.00, passed 6-13-95)
Penalty, see § 95.99
§ 95.11 DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Any entrance whether in a rural or urban area, shall not obstruct or
restrict the normal water drainage along or across the county road, unless
suitable provisions are made therefor. The Public Works Superintendent shall be
satisfied that the type, size, and installation of the drainage features
proposed in the application are adequate for present and foreseeable future
requirements and have a reasonable life span. The type of drainage pipe
material shall be approved by the Public Works Superintendent.
   (B)   Requirements for drainage shall be as follows:
      (1)   Necessary drainage structures for an entrance shall not be tied
onto an existing roadway drainage structure unless the necessary junction
boxes, manholes, and catch basins are installed by permittee in accordance with
county specifications.
      (2)   The size, length and type of the entrance pipe shall be as required
by the Public Works Superintendent, but in no case shall be less than 15 inches
in diameter and not less than 20 feet in length.
      (3)   All entrance pipe shall meet appropriate Public Works Department
specifications and requirements. Pipe shall be of sufficient length to prevent
end damage and may require that the permittee provide concrete headwalls.
Sloped box inlet or outlet may be required by the County Superintendent,
(Standard Drawing No. RDB 110-01 or 111-02).
      (4)   Valley gutters constructed of concrete or bituminous material,
which meet Public Works Department standards, may be used in lieu of entrance
pipe where such pipe cannot be placed.
      (5)   Where long lengths of pipe are used, catch basins or clean-out
boxes shall be installed at approximate intervals of 50 feet based on pipe
diameter of 15 inches. Special consideration may be given to placement of
clean-out boxes at longer intervals for pipe with larger diameters. Boxes shall
also be constructed at all angles in pipe alignment.
      (6)   When necessary, gratings and catch basins must be employed to
intercept and prevent water flowing from the driveway over the sidewalks or
roadway.
      (7)   Utilities are not to be placed in or through existing drainage
structures.
      (8)   When a fill is to be placed against an existing roadway, such fill
shall be constructed to intersect the outside shoulder edge and slope away from
the road on a 6:1 slope to the ditch flow line or a depth of three feet.
Furthermore, special drainage features, as required by the Public Works
Superintendent, shall be required of the applicant to adequately drain the road
bed and shoulders. This refers to french drains or toe drains in the existing
fill.
      (9)   Occasionally, underpavement drainage is provided by sand, crushed
stone or other types of drains from the pavement through the shoulder of the
road. Requests to join the pavement at these existing drainage points must
accompanied by plans showing the method proposed to extend these drains so that
their original purpose will be continued. This provision is applicable to
commercial and private entrances.
      (10) Any proposal to alter or significantly increase a drainage area,
run-off factors or change in any way a drainage structure must be accompanied
by a complete drainage survey (upstream and downstream) based on a 25-year and
100-year storm with hydraulic analysis of all affected drainage structures in
the area and prepared by a registered, licensed engineer.

Penalty, see § 95.99
§ 95.12 RESPONSIBILITY OF PERMITTEE FOR INADEQUATE DOWNSTREAM HIGHWAY DRAINAGE
FACILITIES.
   (A)   In the event that any permittee's development is to create sufficient
additional surface drainage run-off, so that the existing downstream highway
drainage facilities such as cross-drain pipes or culverts, storm drain systems,
entrance pipes open ditches, paved ditches, special channels or any other
drainage facility within a county maintained right-of-way becomes inadequate to
accommodate the increased flow, it is then the sole responsibility of the
permittee to:
      (1)   Modify or replace the downstream highway drainage facility or
facilities, in order that the increased flow is adequately accommodated to the
satisfaction of the Public Works Department; or
      (2)   Provide an on-site retention basin of appropriate capacity and
discharge design to enable the existing downstream highway drainage facilities
to continue to function adequately to the satisfaction of the Public Works
Department.
   (B)   The permittee is required to gather whatever data and submit whatever
plans and information as the Public Works Superintendent deems necessary in
order to enable him to properly evaluate the proposals and ascertain that
highway standards will be met and satisfactory results obtained.
   (C)   Any alterations and measures determined to be necessary are to be a
part of the permittee's access permit, and no permits are to be issued prior to

mattresses), those items are required to be included in the inventory, but need
not be maintained and can be destroyed or, if evidence of criminal activity,
seized by peace officers in accordance with the law.
   (D)   Unless stated otherwise in this chapter, the county must maintain
personal property items collected at the camp in a safe and secure place for a
minimum of 30 days. Animals found abandoned with other personal property will
be transported to the County Animal Shelter in compliance with the county's
animal control laws and ordinances, except the Director shall include a waiver
of fees when the owner claims the animal in person at the shelter within seven
days of impoundment. Abandoned vehicles shall he disposed of and the proceeds
distributed in accordance with this code of ordinances and state law.
   (E)   At the time of issuing notice of a violation, in addition to the
written notice requirements set forth above in division (B) of this section,
notice shall be posted at the site of the camp, providing a telephone number to
call for additional information. The notice shall be posted in a conspicuous
place in the general vicinity, but not more than 30 feet from the location
where the personal property is being stored. The notice must be laminated or
otherwise made to be weather-resistant. Notice shall provide the earliest date
on which personal property items may be removed and a phone number to call to
reclaim personal property items. The posted notice shall include a visual
symbol or symbols as well as text. After 30 days, absent circumstances
necessitating a longer period, the county may dispose of any unclaimed personal
property items and remove the notice regarding personal property.
   (F)   No enforcement officer or employee of the county may remove personal
property items from a camp until the county, through any designated department,
has provided information about local shelters where individuals, if homeless,
can seek shelter.
   (G)   The county shall maintain records of notices issued pursuant to this
chapter for a minimum period of five years and in a manner consistent with its
records-retention policies.

§ 110.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to both regulate and tax those engaged in
franchises, trades, occupations, professions and other businesses in the
county. As provided in the 1978 amendment (House Bill 393) to KRS 68.197, the
question of whether a license fee shall be imposed at a percentage rate not to
exceed 1% was submitted to the voters of the county at the November 7, 1978,
general election. As a result of the affirmative vote by a majority of the
voters, nothing herein contained shall prevent the Fiscal Court, as determined
necessary from time to time for the benefit of the county, from lowering or
raising the percentage rate or fixed amount license fee set out in §
110.03, provided that the license fees shall not exceed the rate authorized by
KRS 68.197.
(Ord. 225.48, passed 12-27-07; Am. Ord. 225.50, passed 2-16-08)
§ 110.03 IMPOSITION OF LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   For the purpose of providing funds for the general operating expenses
of the county and the services and function provided thereby, and subject to
the provisions of KRS 67.750 through 67.795, and except as provided by division
(B) of this section, an occupational license fee is hereby levied and imposed
upon everybody engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
businesses in the County, for the privilege of that engagement.
   (B)   The occupational license tax (fee) that is levied and imposed by shall
be set at the rate of:
      (1)   Compensation. The occupational license tax (fee) shall be measured
by 0.6997% of the amount of all wages and compensation paid or payable in the
county for work done or services performed or rendered in the county by every
resident and nonresident who is an employee up to the maximum taxable earnings
applicable to the Federal Social Security Program (Old Age, Survivors and
Disability Insurance (OASDI) as adjusted annually.
      (2)   Net profit. The occupational license tax (fee) shall be measured by
0.9097% of the net profits up to 50% of the maximum taxable earnings applicable
to the Federal Social Security Program (Old Age, Survivors and Disability
Insurance (OASDI) as adjusted annually and 0.1097% of net profit exceeding the
aforementioned 50% cap, up to the maximum taxable earnings applicable to the
Federal Social Security Program (OASDI) as adjusted annually, for the net
profit from business conducted in the county by a resident or nonresident
business entity.
      (3)   Net profit exemption. Business entities engaged in franchises,
trades, occupations, professions, and other businesses in the county after
January 1, 2024, will be exempt from paying a net profit occupational license
tax (fee) subject to biannual review (every two years) of this exemption by the
Fiscal Court. Even though exempt from paying the tax, business entities are
still required to prepare and submit annual net profit schedules and forms as
instructed at https://www.kentoncounty.org/2334/What-When-to-File.
   (C)   No employee, business, trade, occupation or profession shall have
withheld from their salary or wages, an amount in excess of the amount
ascertained by multiplying the social security maximum, as defined annually by
the Federal Government, by the rate of the occupational license fee as set
forth in this section.
   (D)   As authorized by KRS 68.197, in order to reduce administrative costs
and to minimize paperwork for employers, employees and businesses, any person,
individual, partnership, professional association, joint venture, or
corporation may elect to pay an annual fixed amount license fee equal to an
amount ascertained by multiplying the social security maximum, as established
by the Federal Government, by the rate of the occupational license fee as set
forth in this section, payable in advance rather than as set forth in this
chapter, in lieu of reporting and paying the percentage rate as provided in
this section on salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation for work
done or services performed or rendered in the county and on net profits of
businesses, trades, professions or occupations from activities conducted in the
county. The election shall be made on the forms available from the License
Inspector. Any employee making the election shall furnish a copy of the form to
his or her employer for withholding purposes. Beginning January 1, 2001, and
annually thereafter, any individual, partnership, professional association,
joint venture or corporation electing to pay the annual fixed amount license
fee in advance, shall do so prior to April 15 of each year.
   (E)   The net profits received from the operation of real estate by persons,
trust companies and real estate agents, for or on behalf of persons (or
estates) are subject to the license fee imposed by this chapter.

§ 110.05 PAYMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE FEE.
   When a return in form and substance satisfactory to the License Inspector is
not filed by the employer and the license fees are not paid to the county by
such employer as required by this chapter, the employer shall be responsible
for all applicable interest and penalties stipulated in this chapter.
(Ord. 225.48, passed 12-27-07; Am. Ord. 225.50, passed 2-16-08)
§ 110.06 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   (1)   Pursuant to the authority of KRS 67.753(4), it is hereby
determined that the apportionment provisions of KRS 67.753 do not fairly
represent the extent of the engagement in the county of those, other than an
employee, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business both within and outside of the payroll factor and the sales
factor provided in KRS 67.753 for the apportionment of the net profits of
those, other than employee, who are engaged in any franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business both within and outside of the county.
      (2)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or
rented and used in the county during the computation period, and denominator of
which is the average value of all of the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal
property owned or rented and used anywhere during the computation period. In
the determination of the property factor:
         (a)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.
Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental
rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual
rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub-rentals.
         (b)   The average value of property shall be determined by averaging
the values at the beginning and ending of the computation period, but the
County Administrative Officer may require the averaging of monthly values
during the computation period if reasonably required to reflect properly the
average value of the taxpayer’s property.
   (B)   The proportion of the total net profits everywhere of those, other
than employee, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession
or other business both within and outside of the county that are subject to the
occupational license fee established by this chapter, shall be determined by
multiplying the total net profits thereof everywhere by the quotient of the
total of the payroll factor and the sales factor described in KRS 67.753(2) and
(3), and the property factor described in division (A)(2) of this section, that
the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the
occupation, profession, or other business had in the County during the tax
period will always be either 1,2, or 3. For example if the franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business:
      (1)   Had only the sales revenue factor in the county, during the tax
period, without either the property factor or the payroll factor in the county,
the total business had in the county during the tax period would be 1; or
      (2)   Had both the sales revenue factor and the payroll factor in the
county, during the tax period, without the property factor in the county, the
total number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession
or other business had in the county during the tax period would be 2; or
      (3)   Had the sales revenue factor, the payroll factor, and the property
factor in the county, during the tax period, the total number of those factors
that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the
county during the tax period would be 3.
   (C)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the county, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the county.
The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work perform or services rendered with the county bears to the
total wages and compensation, paid or payable. In order for the county to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (D)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the county during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupation license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the county.
   (E)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.
(Ord. 225.48, passed 12-27-07; Am. Ord. 225.50, passed 2-16-08)
§ 110.07 OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE RETURNS TO BE MADE.
   (A)   All business entity returns for the preceding taxable year shall be
made by April 15th of each year, except returns made on the basis of a fiscal
year, which shall be made by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
the close of the fiscal year. Blank forms for returns shall be supplied by the
county.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its
occupational license tax return with the county. Whenever, in the opinion of
the county, it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return of any
business entity in order to audit the return, the county may compel the
business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and
schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed. The county
may also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the Federal
Government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns, and comply with rules as the county from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the county deems it necessary, the county may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath, or keep records , as the county deems sufficient
to determine the tax liability of the business entity.
   (D)   The county may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the
taxable income of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of
the business entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity, as
appears from the face of the return shall be paid to the county at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return, determined without
regard to any extension of time for filing the return.

§ 110.08 EMPLOYERS TO WITHHOLD LICENSE FEES AND FILE RETURNS.
   (A)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee shall
deduct and withhold form the compensation an occupational license fee (tax)
calculated under §
110.03 of this chapter.
   (B)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold occupational license
fee (tax) under this section shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and

this section, unless the employer is permitted or required to report within a
reasonable time after some other period as determined by the county.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the county any sums
required to be withheld and paid by this chapter shall be personally and
individually liable to the county for any sum or sums withheld, or required to
be withheld, in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The county shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the county sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the county, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the county. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
county.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the county a reconciliation of the occupational
license fee (tax) withheld where compensation is paid or payable to employees.
Either copies of the federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax
statements, or a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent
information, as determined by the county, shall be submitted.
   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or before
January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license fee (tax) deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the
employee for payment to the county during the preceding calendar year.
   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the occupational
license fee (tax) required to be deducted and withheld under this section.
   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this section shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid to one or
more employees of any business entity, and neither the corporate dissolution or
withdrawal of the business entity from the county, nor the cessation of holding
any corporate office shall discharge that liability; provided that the person
and individual liability shall apply to each or every person holding the
corporate office at the time the occupational license fee (tax) becomes or
became obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under
this subsection unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account
for, or pay over the occupational license fee (tax) imposed by the county at
the time that the occupational license fee (tax) imposed by the county become
or became due.
   (I)   Every employee receiving compensation in the county subject to the
occupational license fee (tax) imposed by this chapter shall be liable for the
occupational license fee (tax) notwithstanding the provisions of divisions (G)
and (H) of this section.

permission in full knowledge of its provisions. Such written permission shall
be for a limited period of time not to exceed one year, which shall be
renewable at the option of the subscriber. No penalty shall be invoked for a
subscriber's failure to provide or renew such an authorization. (This statement
must be in authorization). The authorization shall be revokable at any time by
the subscriber without penalty of any kind whatsoever. Such authorization is

company must make cable television service available to every dwelling unit
within the initial service area.
         (a)   The company must make cable television service available to at
least 20% of the dwelling units within the initial service area within one year

years from the date of the award of the franchise.
      (2)   The company, in its application, may propose a timetable of
construction which will make cable television service available in the initial
service area sooner than the above minimum requirements, in which case the
company's application will be incorporated by reference pursuant to §
111.04, and will be binding upon the company.
      (3)   Notwithstanding conflicting commitments in the company's
application, the company must make cable service available within the
additional service area, using either single or dual cable technology: to every
dwelling unit by June 19, 1995; to at least 70% of the dwelling units by June
19, 1994; and to at least 40% of the dwelling units by June 19, 1993.
      (4)   Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable, unless specifically
approved by the Board, will be considered a violation of this chapter for which
the provisions of either §
111.58 or §
111.59 shall apply, as determined by the Board.
   (B)   Line extensions. In areas of the franchise territory not included in
the initial service area, the company shall be required to extend its system
pursuant to the following requirements:
      (1)   The company must extend and make cable television service available

200 feet.
      (5)   Whenever the company shall have received written requests for
services from at least 15 assured subscribers within 1,300 cable feet of its
aerial trunk cable, it shall extend its system to such subscribers solely for
the usual connection and service fees for all subscribers, provided that such
extension is technically and economically feasible. The 1,300 cable feet shall
be measured in extension length of company's cable required for service located
within the public way or easement and shall not include the length of necessary
drop to the subscriber's house or premises.
   (C)   Line extension policy. The company, in its application, may propose a
line extension policy which will result in serving more residents of the county

of the terms of this chapter for which the provisions of either §§
111.58 or
111.59 shall apply, as determined by the Board.

(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80; Am. Ord. 450.5, passed 7-17-92)
§ 111.33 USE OF STREETS.
   (A)   Interference with persons and improvements. The company's system,
poles, wires, and appurtenances shall be located, erected and maintained so
that none of its facilities shall endanger or interfere with the lives of
persons, or interfere with any improvements the county, Commonwealth, and
cities may deem proper to make, or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free
use of the streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public property.
   (B)   Minimum interference with public ways. All transmission and
distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by the company within the
county shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use
of streets, alleys, and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum
interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who
adjoin any of the streets, alleys or other public ways and places.
   (C)   Restoration to prior condition. In case of any disturbance of
pavement, sidewalk, driveway or other surfacing, the company shall, at its own
cost and expense and in a manner approved by the Board, replace and restore all
paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping, or surface of any street or alley
disturbed, in as good condition as before the work was commenced and in
accordance with standards for such work set by the Board.
   (D)   Erection, removal, and common uses of poles.
      (1)   No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the
company without prior approval of the Cable Board with regard to location,
height, types, and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole
or wire-holding structure of the company shall be a vested interest and such
poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the company at its own
expense whenever the Board determines that the public convenience would be
enhanced thereby.
      (2)   Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for
use in serving the county are available for use by the company, but it does not
make arrangements for such use, the Board may require the company to use such
poles and structures if it determines that the public convenience would be
enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the company are just and
reasonable.
      (3)   Where the county, city or a public utility serving the county
desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the
company, but agreement thereof with the company cannot be reached, the Board
may require the company to permit such use for such consideration and upon such
terms as the Board shall determine to be just and reasonable, if the Board
determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not
unduly interfere with the company's operations.
   (E)   Relocation of the facilities. In the event that at any time during the
period of this franchise, the Commonwealth, county or city shall lawfully elect
to alter or change the grade of any street, alley or other public way, the
company, upon reasonable notice by the proper municipality, shall remove or
relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes
and other fixtures at its own expense.
   (F)   Cooperation with building movers. The company shall, on the request of
any person holding a building moving permit issued by the county or city,
temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The
expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid
by the person requesting the same, and the company shall have the authority to
require such payment in advance. The company shall be given not less than 48
hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
   (G)   Tree trimming. The company shall not remove any tree or trim any
portion, either above, at or below ground level, of any tree within any public
place without the prior consent of the Board. Regardless of who performs the
work requested by the company, the company shall be responsible, shall defend
and hold the county harmless for any and all damages to any tree as a result of
trimming, or to the land surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or
removed.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.34 OPERATIONAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   The company shall put, keep, and maintain all parts of the system in
good condition throughout the entire franchise period.
   (B)   Upon the reasonable request for service by any person located within
the franchise territory, the company shall, within 30 days, furnish the
requested service to such person within terms of the line extension policy. A
request for service shall be unreasonable for the purpose of this subsection if
no trunk line installation capable of servicing that person's block has as yet
been installed.
   (C)   The company shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and
interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Such
interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice and shall occur
during periods of minimum system use.
   (D)   The company shall not allow its cable or other operations to interfere
with television reception of persons not served by company, nor shall the
system interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any manner, the operation of the
various utilities serving the residents within the confines of the county.
   (E)   The company shall continue, through the term of the franchise, to
maintain the technical standards and quality of service set forth in this
chapter. Should the Board find, by resolution, that the company has failed to
maintain these technical standards and quality of service, and should it, by
resolution, specifically enumerate improvements to be made, the company shall
make such improvements. Failure to make such improvements within three months
of such resolution will constitute a breach of a condition for which the remedy
of §
111.58(D) is applicable.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.35 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE MANDATORY.
   (A)   It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service
insofar as their financial and other obligations to the company are honored. In
the event that the company elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify, or sell the
system, or the Board gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew the
franchise, the company shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive
continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances. In the event
of a change of franchisee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system,
the company shall cooperate with the county, new franchisee or operator in
maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the
company shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it
operates the system, and shall be entitled to reasonable costs for its services
when it no longer operates the system.
   (B)   In the event the company fails to operate the system for seven
consecutive days without prior approval of the Board or without just cause, the
Board may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until
such time as the company restores service under conditions acceptable to the
Board or a permanent operator is selected. If the Board is required to fulfill
this obligation for the company, the company shall reimburse the Board for all
reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues from the system received by
the Board that are the result of the company's failure to perform.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.36 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Cable Board is designated as having primary responsibility for the
continuing administration of the franchise and implementation of complaint
procedures.
   (B)   During the term of the franchise, and any renewal thereof, the company
shall maintain a local business office for the purpose of receiving and
resolving all complaints regarding the quality of service, equipment
malfunctions, and similar matters. The office must be reachable by a local,
toll-free telephone call to receive complaints regarding quality of service,
equipment malfunctions and similar matters. The local office shall be open to
receive inquiries or complaints from subscribers during normal business hours,
and in no event less than 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday,
excluding legal holidays. The company shall provide the means to accept
complaint calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Any service complaints shall
be investigated within 48 hours of receipt. The company shall keep a
maintenance service log which will indicate the nature of each service
complaint, the date and time it was received, the disposition of the complaint
and the time and date thereof. This log shall be made available for periodic
inspection by the Board.
   (C)   As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the system, the company
shall, by appropriate means, such as a card or brochure, furnish information
concerning the procedures for making inquiries or complaints, including the
name, address and local telephone number of the employee or employees or agent
to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed, and furnish
information concerning the county office responsible for administration of the
franchise with the address and telephone number of the office.
   (D)   When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists
other evidence which, in the judgment of the Cable Board, casts doubt on the
reliability or quality of cable service, the Board shall have the right and
authority to require the company to test, analyze, and report on the
performance of the system. The company shall fully cooperate with the Board in
performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report, if requested,
within 30 days after notice. Such report shall include the following
information:
      (1)   The nature of the complaint or problem which precipitated the
special tests.
      (2)   What system component was tested.
      (3)   The equipment used and procedures employed in testing.
      (4)   The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was
resolved.
      (5)   Any other information pertinent to said tests and analysis which
may be required.
   (E)   The Board may require that tests be supervised, at the company's
expense, by a professional engineer not on the permanent staff of the company.
The engineer should sign all records of special tests and forward to the Board
such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and
recommending actions to be taken.
   (F)   The Board's right under this section shall be limited to requiring
tests, analyses, and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics
based on the complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as
the Board has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other
evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against
substandard cable service.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.37 COMPANY RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The company shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations,
terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable the company to exercise its rights and perform
its obligations under this franchise and to assure an uninterrupted service to
each and all of its customers. However, such rules, regulations, terms and
conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable
state and federal laws, rules and regulations.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.38 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   For the reason that the streets of the county, Commonwealth, and
cities to be used by the company in the operation of its system within the
boundaries of the county are valuable public properties acquired and maintained
by the county, Commonwealth, and cities at great expense to its taxpayers, and
that the grant to the company to the streets is a valuable property right
without which the company would be required to invest substantial capital in
right-of-way costs and acquisitions, the company shall pay to the Board an
amount equal to 5% of the company's gross annual revenue from all sources
attributable to the operations of the company within the confines of the
franchise area. In the event that the FCC lacks jurisdiction to impose a
limitation on franchise fees, or that the limit is raised, then the franchise
fee will be subject to renegotiation.
   (B)   This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to
the county, city, or other taxing jurisdiction by the company.
   (C)   The franchise fee and any other cost or penalties assessed shall be
payable quarterly, and the company shall file a complete and accurate verified
statement of all gross receipts within the county during the period for which
the payment is made. The payment shall be made to the Board not later than 30
days after the expiration of each quarter year.
   (D)   In order to facilitate the initial operation of the Kenton/Boone CATV
Board, the company shall pay to the Board within 30 days of the franchise
award, a sum of $30,000. This sum shall be considered a pre-paid franchise fee
and will be deducted from the annual franchise fee payment in equal amounts
over the first ten years of system operation.
   (E)   The Board shall have the right to inspect the company's income records
and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable
under this chapter; provided, however, that such audit shall take place within
36 months following the close of each of the company's fiscal years. Any
additional amount due to the Board as a result of the audit shall be paid
within 30 days following written notice to the company by the Board which
notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
   (F)   In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount, cost or
penalty, is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified,
interest shall be charged daily from such date at the annual rate of 8% plus 5%
penalty.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80; Am. Ord. 450.5, passed 7-17-92)
§ 111.39 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (A)   The franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or
in part, or leased, sublet, or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title
thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein,
pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the Cable
Board. The company may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a wholly
owned subsidiary of the company and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the
franchise back to the company without such consent. The proposed assignee must
show financial responsibility as determined by the Board and must agree to
comply with all provisions of the franchise. The Board shall be deemed to have
consented to a proposed transfer or assignment in the event its refusal to
consent is not communicated in writing to the company within 60 days following
receipt of written notice of the proposed transfer or assignment.
   (B)   The company shall promptly notify the Board of any actual or proposed
change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of the
company. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to major stockholders
but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable
presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the
acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of 10% of the
voting shares of the company. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control
of the company shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and
until the Board shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent
to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the Board may inquire into
the qualification of the prospective controlling party, and the company shall
assist the Board in any such inquiry.
   (C)   The consent or approval of the Board to any transfer of the company
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the county in and to
the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to
the terms and conditions of the franchise.
   (D)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Board will not
approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to substantial
completion of construction of the proposed system.
   (E)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved
without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise
agreement.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.40 AVAILABILITY OF BOOKS AND RECORDS.
   The company shall fully cooperate in making available at reasonable times,
and the Cable Board shall have the right to inspect the books, records, maps,
plans and other like materials of the company applicable to the Cable system,
at any time during normal business hours provided that where volume and
convenience necessitate, the company may require inspection to take place on
company premises at the local office.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.41 OTHER PETITIONS AND APPLICATIONS.
   Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports submitted
by the company to the Federal Communications Commission, Securities and
Exchange Commission (specifically 10K and 8K) or any other federal or state
regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matters
affecting cable television operations authorized pursuant to the franchise,
shall be provided simultaneously to the Board.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.42 FISCAL REPORTS.
   The company shall file annually with the Board, no later than 120 days after
the end of the company's fiscal year, a copy of a financial report applicable
to the CATV system including an income statement applicable to its operations
during the preceding 12-month period, a balance sheet, and a statement of its
properties devoted to CATV system operations, by categories, giving its
investment in such properties on the basis of original cost, less applicable
depreciation. These reports shall be certified as correct by an authorized
officer of the company and there shall be submitted along with them such other
reasonable information as the Board shall request with respect to the company's
properties and expenses related to its CATV system operations within the
county. The Board may hire an independent CPA to audit the company's financial
records, in which case the company shall provide all necessary records to the
CPA.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.43 REMOVAL OF CATV SYSTEM.
   At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted, or upon
its termination as provided herein, the company shall forthwith, upon notice by
the Board, remove at its own expense all designated portions of the CATV system
from all streets and public property within the county. If the company fails to
do so, the county may perform the work at the company's expense. A bond shall
be furnished by the company in an amount sufficient to cover this expense.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.44 REQUIRED SERVICES AND FACILITIES.

minimum channel capacity, and minimum activated channels as follows:
      (1)   In the initial service area, the company shall provide a dual-cable
system in accordance with the provisions in the company's application.
      (2)   Notwithstanding conflicting commitments in the company's
application, in the additional service area the company, at its discretion, may
install either dual or single cable, provided that the company activates at
least 54 channels for subscriber viewing.
   (B)   Repealed.
   (C)   Notwithstanding conflicting commitments in its application, the
company shall maintain the following within the two-county region:
      (1)   At least one specially-designated, noncommercial public access
channel available on a first-come, nondiscriminatory basis;
      (2)   At least one specially-designated access channel for use by local
elementary and secondary educational institutions and authorities;
      (3)   At least one specially-designated access channel for use by higher

      (4)   At least two specially-designated access channels for local
government uses.
   (D)   The company shall have available equipment and other related
production facilities for local production and presentation of cablecast
programs other than automated services and shall permit its use for the
production and presentation of public access programs. In addition, the company
shall cablecast at least 27.5 hours per week of local origination programming,
excluding access programming, programming received via satellite, automated
programming (such as messages produced by alphanumeric character generation),
advertising and program production for a fee. At least ten hours of such local
origination programming shall consist of first-run programming produced
locally, and at least seven and one-half hours of such local origination
programming shall consist of first-run headline news and sports programming.
The other ten hours of local origination programming may consist of either
original first-run programming produced locally, or re-programming and re-runs
of such programming, in any proportion at the company's option. This obligation
supersedes all obligations for local origination programming by the cable
operator described in Form K of the company's application.
   (E)   All subscribers receiving channels showing first-run movies and
special entertainment events shall be provided with a key-lock device which
prevents the unauthorized viewing of such channels.
   (F)   The company shall incorporate into its cable television system the
capacity which will permit the county, in times of emergency, to override, by
remote control, the audio portion of all channels simultaneously. The company
shall designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts of both
audio and video. The company shall cooperate with the county in the use and
operation of the emergency alert override system.
   (G)   (1)   The company may be required to interconnect its system with
other broadband communications facilities. Such interconnection shall be made
within the time limit established by the Board. The interconnection shall, at
the Board's discretion, be accomplished according to the method and technical
standards determined by the Board and generally accepted in industry practices.
For the purpose of this division, BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY means any
network of cable, optical, electrical or electronic equipment, including cable
television systems, used for the purpose of transmitting telecommunications
signals.
      (2)   The company shall use all reasonable diligence in negotiating with
operators of other broadband systems and governmental authorities in arranging
for such interconnection. The company may be excused from any requirements
under this division upon a showing that the operator of the broadband facility
to be interconnected or the franchising authorities in other jurisdictions
refuse to reach a reasonable agreement regarding such interconnection.
   (H)   The company shall provide such additional services and facilities as
are contained in its application, which is incorporated by reference herein.
However, notwithstanding this requirement, the company shall not be obliged to
provide interactive services such as those described in Form J (pp. 10kk-10pp)
of the company's application. The company's release from such interactive
service obligations shall not be construed to alter the company's obligations
with respect to the institutional network, such as those described in Form I
(pp. 8-11j, 17d, and 17i) of the company's application.

one appointed representative to the Board, such appointment to be made at the
Mayor's discretion. Cities whose number of subscribers reaches 5,000 shall be
entitled to an additional appointed representative. Cities shall be entitled to

appointed representatives.
      (2)   The Kenton County Fiscal Court and the Boone County Fiscal Court
shall each be entitled to four appointed representatives, such appointments to
be made at the discretion of the Judge/Executives, to provide for the

of the following year. Seats lost as a result of subscriber reduction shall be
dissolved regardless of whether a full term has been served or not.
   (D)   Terms of service for all appointed representatives shall remain at two
years. Current Board Members shall serve the remainder of their terms together

immediately dissolved unless it is one which would continue to exist under this
plan.

ordinance(s) consistent with its powers under this agreement.

to it from Storer and Jacor, and any future franchisees in consideration of the
use by these or any other franchisees of any and all public rights-of-way and/
or easements over private property. The Budget Committee of the Cable Board
shall develop an annual budget for the Cable Board not later than December 1 of
each year and submit it to the Cable Board members for their approval.

§ 111.59 FORFEITURE AND TERMINATION.

under the franchise or otherwise, the Board reserves the right to forfeit and
terminate the franchise and all rights and privileges of the company hereunder
in the event of a substantial breach of its terms and conditions. A substantial
breach by the company shall include, but shall not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Violation of any material provision of the franchise or any
material rule, order, regulation or determination of the Cable Board made
pursuant to the franchise;
      (2)   Attempt to evade any material provision of the franchise or

interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from
the Cable Board; or
      (6)   Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or
negotiation of the franchise.
   (B)   The foregoing shall not constitute a major breach if the violation
occurs but it is without fault of the company or occurs as a result of
circumstances beyond its control. The company shall not be excused by mere
economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers
or employees.
   (C)   The Cable Board may make a written demand that the company comply with
any such provision, rule, order, or determination under or pursuant to the
franchise. If the violation by the company continues for a period of 30 days
following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action
has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the county may
place the issue of termination of the franchise before the Cable Board. The
Board shall cause to be served upon the company at least 20 days prior to the
date the Board considers the issue of termination, a written notice of intent
to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public
notice shall be given of the meeting and issue which the Board is to consider.
   (D)   The Cable Board shall hear and consider the issue and shall hear any
person interested therein, and shall determine in its discretion whether or not
any violation by the company has occurred.
   (E)   If the Cable Board shall determine the violation by the company was
the fault of the company and within its control, the Board may, by resolution,
declare that the franchise of the company shall be forfeited and terminated
unless there is compliance within such period as the Cable Board may fix, such
period not to be less than 60 days, provided no opportunity for compliance need
be granted for fraud or misrepresentation.
   (F)   The issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed
upon the Board agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance.
The Board then may terminate the franchise forthwith upon finding that the
company has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend the period, in
its discretion.

§ 111.60 FORECLOSURE.
   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of
the CATV system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all or a
substantial part of the CATV system, the company shall notify the Board of such
fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in
control of the company has taken place and the provisions of the franchise
governing the consent of the Cable Board to such change in control of the
company shall apply.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.61 RECEIVERSHIP.
   The Board shall have the right to cancel the franchise 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver, or trustee, to take over and conduct the business of
the company, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other
action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been
vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:

§ 111.62 PURCHASE OF CATV SYSTEM BY COUNTY.
   (A)   Rights to purchase. In the event the company forfeits and the county
terminates the franchise pursuant to provisions of this chapter, or at the
normal expiration of the franchise term, the county shall have the right,
directly or as an intermediary, to purchase the CATV system.
   (B)   Franchise valuation.
      (1)   The value of the franchise shall be the aggregate of the
replacement value of tangible assets and the going concern value of the CATV
system.
      (2)   For the purpose of this division, GOING CONCERN VALUE shall mean
the benefits that attach to the business as a result of its location in the
county, the company's reputation among franchise subscribers or potential
subscribers for dependability and quality of service, and any other
circumstances resulting in probable retention of old subscribers or acquisition
of new subscribers; except no value shall be assigned to either the franchise
itself or any right, privilege or expectancy arising to the company out of the
right to transact business under the franchise, and particularly no value shall
be allowed for any increase in value arising out of any expectation of cable
CATV system revenues beyond the forfeiture and termination date or expiration
date, whichever is sooner.
      (3)   In the acceptance of this franchise, the company expressly waives
its rights, if any, to relocation costs that might otherwise be provided by
law.
   (C)   Date of valuation. The date of valuation shall be no earlier than the
day following the date of expiration or termination and no later than the date
the county makes a fair and reasonable offer for the system or the date of
transfer of ownership, whichever occurs first.
   (D)   Transfer to county. Upon exercise of this option and the payment of
the above sum by the county and its service of official notice of such action
upon the company, the company shall immediately transfer to the county
possession and title to all facilities and property, real and personal, of the
CATV system, free from any and all liens and encumbrances not agreed to be
assumed by the county in lieu of some portion of the purchase price set forth
above; and the company shall execute such warranty deeds or other instruments
of conveyance to the county as shall be necessary for this purpose.
   (E)   Arbitration of value and costs.
      (1)   In the event the county and the company cannot agree upon the value
of the CATV system, either may give notice of a demand to the other for
arbitration.
      (2)   Arbitration shall commence and proceed according to law except as
follows:
         (a)   The parties shall, within 15 days, appoint one arbitrator each
who is experienced and knowledgeable in the valuation of business property.
Arbitrators shall each agree upon the selection of a third arbitrator,
similarly qualified, within 15 days.
         (b)   Within 30 days after appointment of all arbitrators and upon ten
day's written notice to parties, the Board of Arbitrators shall commence a
hearing on the issue of valuation.
         (c)   The hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the
request of either party. All hearing proceedings, debate and deliberations
shall be open to the public and at such times and places as contained in the
notice or as thereafter publicly stated in the order to adjourn, except as
otherwise authorized by the County Attorney.
         (d)   At the close of the hearings and within 30 days, the Board of
Arbitrators shall prepare findings and a decision agreed upon by a majority of
the Board which shall be filed with the county and served by mail upon the
company. Unless the parties extend by mutual agreement the time which the Board
of Arbitrators has to make a decision, the proceedings shall become null and
void and shall be started anew.
         (e)   The decision of the Board shall be final and binding upon the
parties.
         (f)   Either party may seek judicial relief in the following
circumstances:
            1.   A party fails to select an arbitrator;
            2.   The arbitrators fail to select a third arbitrator;
            3.   One or more arbitrator is unqualified;
            4.   Designated time limits have been exceeded;
            5.   The Board has not proceeded expeditiously; and
            6.   Based upon the record, the Board abused its discretion.
         (g)   In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines the
Board of Arbitrators has abused its discretion, it may order the arbitration
procedure repeated and issue findings, orders and directions, with costs of
suit to be awarded to the prevailing party.
         (h)   Cost of arbitration shall be borne equally unless the Board of
Arbitrators finds the offer of the county or the demand of the company was
unreasonable, in which case, costs may be apportioned so that less or none of
the costs may be borne by one party.
(Ord. 450.1, passed 12-4-80)
§ 111.63 COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of the franchise to the contrary,
the company shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the
state and federal government or any administrative agencies thereof. However,
if any such state or federal law or regulation shall require the company to
perform any service, or shall permit the company to perform any service, or
shall prohibit the company from performing any service, in conflict with the

as possible following knowledge thereof, the company shall notify the Cable
Board of the point of conflict believed to exist between such regulation or law
and the laws or regulations of the county or the franchise.

established procedures to avoid such actions in the future.
      (4)   The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to KRS 13B.080 - 13B.090(1)

in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Hearing procedure. Where a hearing is required under this section, the
Hearing Officer shall set the date for the hearing after no less than ten
calendar days and no more than 30 calendar days after the License Inspector
receives verified or otherwise credible information that a violation may have
occurred. The Hearing Officer shall send written notice to the owner(s),
licensee, or any persons filing a complaint with the License Inspector. The
hearing shall be to make findings of fact in the matter and shall be recorded,
transcribed, and conducted pursuant to KRS 13B.080 - 13B.090(1) - (6), KRS
1313.100, and KRS 13B.130.
      (1)   Notice of the hearing shall be in writing, and shall set forth the
reason for the hearing or the complaint against the licensee, and shall be
served upon the licensee in person or by registered or certified mail to the
licensee's last known address. If the Hearing Officer is not able to serve
notice upon the licensee in person, and any notice sent by mail is returned by
the postal service, the County Police Chief shall cause the notice to be posted
at the principal entrance of the regulated use, and such posting shall be a
valid means of service.
      (2)   An applicant, licensee, or complainant shall have full right to be
represented by counsel, to produce witnesses and other evidence, and to cross-
examine all witnesses who appear against him or her. Oral evidence shall be
taken only upon oath or affirmation. All proceedings in the hearing shall be
recorded, transcribed and conducted pursuant to KRS 13B.080 - 13B.090(1) - (6),
KRS I3B.100, and KRS 13B.130. Witnesses may be subpoenaed, and, upon request of

the Hearing Officer is not able to serve the order upon the licensee or
applicant in the manner stated in this division (B)(3), the County Police Chief
shall cause the order to be posted at the principal entrance of the regulated
use, and that posting shall be a valid means of service.
      (4)   If the Hearing Officer finds and concludes from the evidence that
the applicant or licensee has violated any of the provisions listed in this
chapter, he or she may suspend or revoke the license issued under this chapter,
or in the case of a renewal application, refuse to renew the license, in
accordance with the provisions of license renewal.

(Ord. 451.11, passed 1-25-05)
§ 113.39 BURDEN OF PROOF IN SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION HEARING; PRESUMPTIONS.
   The burden of proof in a hearing involving the possible suspension or
revocation of a license issued under this chapter shall be by a preponderance
of the evidence, regardless of the fact that some of the criteria for
suspension or revocation refer to acts that may be criminal in nature and that
thus would involve a higher standard of proof in another context. The Hearing
Officer may take administrative notice of any conviction of a crime or civil
infraction pertinent to the proceedings. Any act or omission by an entertainer,
dancer, employee and/or patron constituting a violation of this section shall
be presumed to be the act or omission of the owner or operator for the purposes
of determining whether the owner or operator's license shall be revoked or
suspended; proof by the licensee that it took diligent and reasonable measures
to prevent the violations or that the particular violation was entirely
unprecedented in the establishment and that the licensee took prompt corrective
action and has now established procedures to avoid such actions in the future
may be considered in rebuttal of that presumption.

§ 113.40 JUDICIAL REVIEW AND STAY OF ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.

maintained.

settlement.

regulated under this chapter to comply with the building codes, zoning, fire,
health and property maintenance ordinances of the county or of any municipality
within which the business is located, and with the applicable regulations of
departments charged with the implementation and administration of those

after the county has delivered written notification of noncompliance to the
business may be a basis for suspension, revocation or non-renewal of the
license.

§ 130.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   In arriving at realistic penalties for violations of provisions
contained in this subchapter, the primary objective has been to establish them
as part of the simplest possible enforcement system. The system has these
features:
      (1)   A mail-in ticket which:
         (a)   Identifies the violator.
         (b)   Lists and identifies violations of the ordinance provisions by
section numbers.
         (c)   States the prescribed fine beside each violation listed.
         (d)   Provides simple instructions on where the ticket is to be mailed
with a check or money order in the amount of the stipulated fine.
         (e)   States a simple procedure to follow if the violator elects to
appear in court to plead his case rather than mail in the fine.
      (2)   Use of the above ticket by all department and agency personnel
authorized to enforce any section of this subchapter.
      (3)   Use for particularly flagrant violations (dumpouts, garbage
spreading from badly-overloaded solid waste containers, debris-strewn property
and the like). This would be in the form of a direct summons to court, with a
penalty range substantially above those on the mail-in ticket.
   (B)   (1)   Any person who violates any provision of this subchapter for
which no penalty is otherwise provided shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
shall be subject to the following schedule of penalties:
Violations Amount

§ 132.01 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   The Fiscal Court of the County of Kenton hereby finds and determines that it
is in the best interest of the citizens of this County to protect nonsmokers
from involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke in most places of employment,
public buildings, and establishments in public buildings. The Fiscal Court
further finds and determines that a balance should be struck between the health
concerns of non-consumers of tobacco products and the need to minimize
regulation of private spheres of conduct and choice with respect to the use or
nonuse of tobacco products in certain designated public buildings,
establishments in public buildings, and in private places. Therefore, the
Fiscal Court hereby declares that the purpose of this chapter is to preserve
and improve the health, comfort, and environment of the people of this county
by limiting exposure to secondhand smoke.
