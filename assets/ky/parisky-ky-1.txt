to “sections _____ to _____” (inserting section numbers to indicate the

incorporated into the code); and
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the

offense committed against a former ordinance, nor as to any act done, or
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred, or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
so incurred, or any right accrued, or claim arising before the new ordinance
takes effect, except that the proceedings thereafter shall conform, so far as
practicable, to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceedings. If any
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment is mitigated by any provision of the new

danger, a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, or if, in
the absence of immediate action, the effects of the violation will be

written notice with the Bourbon County Joint Planning Office to request a
hearing to contest the citation. If the person fails to respond to the citation
within seven (7) days, the person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a
hearing to contest the citation, and the determination that a violation was
committed shall be considered final. In this event, the citation, as issued,
shall be deemed a final order determining that the violation was committed and
imposing the civil fine set forth in the citation, and the alleged violator
shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order to District
Court. Notice of the final order shall be provided to the cited violator in the
manner set forth in §
22.609(G).

whenever a hearing before an administrative body is required by law for a
particular violation, remedy or abatement action, or when, in the opinion of a
Code Enforcement Officer or the Code Enforcement Board attorney, such a hearing
is necessary or advisable, the Code Enforcement Officer or the Code Enforcement
Board attorney may request such a hearing before the Board, and the Board shall
schedule the hearing and provide notice to the person to whom the citation is

§ 22.608 HEARING OFFICER
   (A)   The Code Enforcement Board shall assign a hearing officer to conduct
hearings in accordance with the procedures set forth in KRS 65.8828.
   (B)   Any member of the Board, including the chair, may be assigned as a
hearing officer. In the event a Board member is assigned as a hearing officer,
he or she shall not participate in the Board’s hearing, deliberation or
decision of the appeal.
   (C)   An individual that is not a member of the Board may be assigned by the
Board as a hearing officer as long as the individual does not hold any elected
or appointed office or position of employment with the city or any jurisdiction
participating in an interlocal agreement for joint enforcement through the
Board.
   (D)   Any person assigned to be a hearing officer by a Code Enforcement
Board shall have experience or shall have received training in the code
enforcement process and basic procedural due process, as specified in the
ordinance creating the Code Enforcement Board. The experience or training shall
include, at a minimum, acquired knowledge regarding a party’s fundamental due
process right to:
      (1)   Be accompanied and advised by counsel at the hearing;
      (2)   Present evidence and witnesses on his or her behalf at the hearing;
      (3)   Examine the evidence opposing the party; and
      (4)   Confront and cross-examine the witnesses opposing the party.
   (E)   An assigned hearing officer may administer oaths to witnesses prior to
their testimony and subpoena alleged violators, witnesses, and evidence to the
hearing to which the officer is assigned.
   (F)   Any hearing conducted by a hearing officer under this section shall
conform to the procedural requirements of KRS 65.8828(1) to (5).
   (G)   The hearing officer shall make written findings of facts and

alleged violator, in the manner required by KRS 65.8828(5), and to the Board.
   (H)   An order issued by a hearing officer under this subsection may be
appealed by the alleged violator to the Board. The appeal shall be filed in
writing to the Board within seven (7) days of the receipt of the order. The
failure to file an appeal within seven (7) days shall render the order entered
by the hearing officer final for all purposes. An individual receiving a final
order under this subsection shall be required to exhaust the administrative
remedy of appeal to the Board, before appealing to the District Court, as
authorized under KRS 65.8831.
(Ord. 2023-3, passed 5-9-23)
§ 22.609 HEARING; NOTICE; FINAL ORDER
   (A)   When a hearing has been requested, the Board and assigned hearing
officer, through its clerical and administrative staff, shall schedule a
hearing.
   (B)   Not less than seven (7) days before the date of the hearing, the Board
and hearing officer, and its clerical and administrative staff, shall notify
the requester of the date, time and place of the hearing. The notice may be
given by regular first-class mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, by
personal delivery, or by leaving the notice at the person’s usual place of
residence with any individual residing therein, who is eighteen (18) years of
age or older, and who is informed of the contents of the notice. The Board may
also elect to provide notice of hearing to any lienholders with an interest in
the subject premises.
   (C)   Any person requesting a hearing who fails to appear at the time and
place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing
to contest the citation, and the determination that a violation was committed
shall be final. In this event, the citation, as issued, shall be deemed a final
order determining that the violation was committed and imposing the civil fine
set forth in the citation, and the alleged violator shall be deemed to have
waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court. Notice of the
final order shall be provided to the cited violator in the manner set forth in
KRS 65.8828(5).
   (D)   All testimony shall be taken under oath and recorded. The assigned
hearing officer shall take testimony from the Code Enforcement Officer, the
alleged violator, and any witnesses to the violation offered by the Code
Enforcement Officer or alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not
apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the
proceedings.
   (E)   Each case that is the subject of a hearing may be presented by an
attorney selected by the local government or by a member of the administrative
staff of the local government. An attorney may either be counsel to the hearing
officer or may represent the local government by presenting cases at the
hearing, but in no case shall an attorney serve in both capacities.
   (F)   The assigned hearing officer shall, based on the evidence, determine
whether a violation was committed. If it determined that no violation was
committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered. If it determined
that a violation was committed, an order shall be issued upholding the citation
and ordering the offender to do either or both of the following:
      (1)   Pay a civil fine up to the maximum authorized by ordinance;
      (2)   Remedy a continuing violation.
   (G)   Every order of the assigned hearing officer shall be reduced to
writing, which shall include findings and conclusions, and the date the order
was issued. A copy of the order shall be furnished to the person named in the
citation. If the person named in the citation is not present at the time an
order is issued, the order shall be delivered to that person by regular first-
class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; by personal delivery; or
by leaving a copy of the order at that person's usual place of residence with
any individual residing therein, who is eighteen (18) years of age or older,
and who is informed of the contents of the order.
(Ord. 2023-3, passed 5-9-23)
§ 22.610 APPEALS; FINAL JUDGMENT
   (A)   Within seven (7) days of the entry of an order by the hearing officer,
the order may be appealed by the alleged violator to the Board, which shall
review the record created before the hearing officer and determine whether
there is substantial evidence on the record to support a finding that a
violation was committed. If the Board determines there is not substantial
evidence on the record, it shall issue an order dismissing the citation. If the
Board determines there is substantial evidence on the record that a violation
was committed, it shall issue a final order upholding the order entered by the
hearing officer. The failure to file an appeal within seven (7) days of the
date of the hearing officer’s order shall render the order entered by the
hearing officer final for all purposes. An individual receiving a final order
under this subsection shall be required to exhaust the administrative remedy of
appeal to the Code Enforcement Board, before appealing to the District Court,
as authorized under KRS 65.8831.
   (B)   An appeal from any final order shall be made to the Bourbon County
District Court within thirty (30) days of the date the final order is issued.
The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a copy of the
final order in the same manner as any civil action under the Kentucky Rules of
Civil Procedure. The District Court shall review the final order de novo.
   (C)   A judgment of the Bourbon County District Court may be appealed to the
Bourbon County Circuit Court in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (D)   If no appeal of the final order is filed within the time allowed in
subsection (A) of this section, the final order shall be deemed final for all
purposes.
(Ord. 2023-3, passed 5-9-23)
§ 22.611 ABATEMENT
   (A)   All violations of ordinances and codes enforced under this article
shall be remedied by the violator within the time period specified in the
specific ordinance or code, unless the Code Enforcement Officer determines that
a shorter time is warranted. In the absence of a specified time period, the
time period for remedy of a violation shall not exceed (10) days. However, the
Code Enforcement Officer, Board or hearing officer may grant an extension of
this time period. The time period for the violation to be remedied shall not be
less than twenty-four (24) hours following issuance of the citation, unless the
Code Enforcement Officer has reason to believe that the existence of the
violation presents imminent danger, a serious threat to the public health,
safety, and welfare, or if, in the absence of immediate action, the effects of
the violation will be irreparable or irreversible. The time period shall
commence upon the issuance of a citation in accordance with §
22.607(B).
   (B)   If the property owner does not abate the violation within the
applicable time period, the city may proceed to abate the violation, keeping an
account of the expense of abatement. The abatement costs, including necessary
and reasonable costs for and associated with clearing, preventing unauthorized
entry to, or demolishing all or a portion of a structure or premises, or taking
any other action with regard to a structure or premises necessary to remedy a
violation, and to maintain and preserve the public health, safety, and welfare
in accordance with any local government ordinance, shall be charged to and paid
by the property owner.
   (C)   Filing of notice to contest a citation in accordance with §
22.607(G) shall serve to toll the city’s abatement of the violation, unless the
Code Enforcement Officer has reason to believe that the existence of the
violation presents imminent danger, a serious threat to the public health,
safety, and welfare, or if, in the absence of immediate action, the effects of
the violation will be irreparable or irreversible. In the event the Board or a
hearing officer determines that the violation contested did occur, the Board or
hearing officer may order that the abatement proceed immediately or within a
specified time period not to exceed thirty (30) days.
   (D)   The Code Official shall bill the property owner of the premises
following abatement. No lien claimed shall be filed against the property until
seven (7) days have elapsed after the bill is sent. If the property is the
subject of litigation, the lien may be filed immediately upon the mailing of
the bill.
(Ord. 2023-3, passed 5-9-23)
§ 22.612 LIENS; FINES; CHARGES; FEES
   (A)   The city shall possess a lien on property owned by the person found by
a final, non-appealable final order as defined by KRS 65.8805(8), or by a final
judgment of the court, to have committed a violation of a city ordinance. The
lien shall be for all civil fines assessed for the violation and for all
charges and fees incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of the
ordinance, including abatement costs. An affidavit of the Code Enforcement
Officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the
regularity of the proceedings pursuant to KRS 65.8801 to 65.8839. The lien:
      (1)   Shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk;
      (2)   Shall be notice to all persons from the time of its recording and
shall bear interest until paid;
      (3)   Subject to KRS 65.8836, shall take precedence over all other liens,
except state, county, school board, and city taxes;
      (4)   Shall continue for ten (10) years following the date of the
nonappealable final order or final judgment of the court; and
      (5)   May be enforced by judicial proceedings, including an action to
foreclose.
   (B)   A copy of the notice of the lien shall be mailed to the owner of the
premises. However, the failure to mail the owner a copy of the notice or the
failure of the owner to receive the notice shall not affect the right of the
city to enforce its lien for the charges as provided by law.
   (C)   In addition to the remedy prescribed above, the person found to have
committed the violation shall be personally responsible for the amount of all
fines assessed for the violation and for all charges and fees incurred by the
city in connection with the enforcement of the applicable code of ordinances.
   (D)   The City Attorney is authorized to bring a civil action for the
collection of delinquent liens and other costs incurred by the city. The city
shall have the same remedies as provided for the recovery of a debt. The City
Attorney is granted authority to use his or her best judgment and discretion to
settle any fine, remedy assessments, and to release liens as he or she deems to
be in the best interests of the city. The City Attorney is further authorized
to make a determination that a lien not be filed if the cost of the lien and
collection is greater than the amount of the lien, when intervening in existing
litigation is not cost effective, or when the lien would not be enforceable as
a matter of law. The City Attorney is also authorized to release any existing
liens that meet the above criteria.
   (E)   Lienholder notification system. Pursuant to KRS 65.8835 and 65.8836,
the city shall obtain and maintain priority over previously filed liens in
accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Individuals and entities, including, but not limited to,
lienholders, may register with the city to receive electronic notification of

         (d)   Electronic mailing address.
      (3)   A registrant may use the electronic form provided on the city
website to submit the information required by subsection (E)(2) of this
section. It shall be the responsibility of the registrant to maintain and
update the required contact information with the city. The city shall inform a
registrant of any evidence received that the electronic mailing address is
invalid or not functional so that the registrant may provide an updated
electronic mailing address.
      (4)   At least once per month and not more than once per week, the city
shall send electronic mail notification of all final orders entered pursuant to
this article since the last date of notification to each party registered
pursuant to this section. The notification shall provide an electronic link to
the city code enforcement database located on the city website. The database
shall include the following information regarding each final order:
         (a)   The name of the person charged with a violation;
         (b)   The physical address of the premises where the violation
occurred;
         (c)   The last known mailing address for the owner of the premises
where the violation occurred;
         (d)   A copy of the full citation;
         (e)   A copy of the full final order; and
         (f)   The status of the final order regarding its ability to be

      (5)   If an appeal is filed on a final order pursuant to this article,
the city shall send electronic mail notification to all registrants.
      (6)   Within ten (10) days of the issuance of a final order pursuant to
this article, the city shall update its code enforcement database to reflect
the issued final order, and shall post the notification required by subsection
(E)(4) of this section containing an updated link to the code enforcement
database on the city website.
      (7)   The city shall maintain the records created under this section for
ten (10) years following their issuance.
   (F)   Lien priority.
      (1)   A lienholder of record who has registered pursuant to §
22.612(E), within forty-five (45) days from the date of issuance of
notification under §
22.612(E), shall:
         (a)   Correct the violation, if it has not already been abated; or
         (b)   Pay all civil fines assessed for the violation, and all charges
and fees incurred by the city in connection with enforcement of the ordinance,
including abatement costs.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from taking
immediate action if necessary.
      (3)   The lien provided by this article shall not take precedence over
previously recorded liens if:
         (a)   The city failed to comply with the requirements of §
22.612(E) for notification of the final order; or
         (b)   A prior lienholder complied with subsection (F)(1) of this
section.
      (4)   A lien that does not take precedence over previously recorded liens
under subsection (F)(3) of this section shall, if the final order remains
partially unsatisfied, continue to take precedence over all other subsequent
liens except liens for state, county, school board and city taxes.
      (5)   The city may record a lien before the forty-five (45) day period
established in subsection (F)(1) of this section expires. If the lien is fully
satisfied prior to the expiration of the forty-five (45) day period, the city
shall release the lien in the County Clerk’s office where the lien is recorded
within fifteen (15) days of satisfaction.
      (6)   Failure of the city to comply with §§
22.615 and
22.616, or failure of a lien to take precedence over previously filed liens as
provided in subsection (F)(3) of this section, shall not limit or restrict any
other remedies the city has against the property of the violator.

has been sought from and refused by the regulated party; or
         (b)   After making a reasonable effort, the applicant has been unable
to locate the regulated party; or
         (c)   The facts or circumstances reasonably show that the purposes of
the inspection or investigation might be frustrated if entry were sought
without first procuring a warrant; and
      (5)   State the basis upon which sufficient cause exists to search or
inspect for violations of the ordinance or regulation specified.
   (D)   Grounds for issuance. 
      (1)   An administrative search warrant may be issued upon a showing that
probable cause for the inspection or investigation exists, and that the other
requirements for granting the warrant are satisfied. Probable cause may be
shown by:
         (a)   Reasonable legislative or administrative standards for
conducting a routine, periodic, or area inspection, and that those standards
are satisfied with respect to the location;
         (b)   A reasonable administrative inspection program exists regarding
the condition of the property, and that the proposed inspection comes within
that program;

rule, standard or order, and that specific evidence of a condition or
nonconformity exists with respect to the particular location; or

to determine or verify the condition of the location.

and
      (4)   Shall   command the return to the appropriate court of any evidence
of ordinance violations found, or of any property seized pursuant thereto, or a
description of such property seized, to be dealt with according to law.
   (F)   Execution and return.
      (1)   Unless otherwise prescribed in the warrant, the officer executing
an administrative search warrant shall make return thereof to the appropriate
court within a reasonable time of its execution. The return shall show the date
and hour of service.
      (2)   Except as provided in the following sentence, in executing a search
warrant, the person authorized to execute it shall, before entry, make a
reasonable effort to present credentials, authority and purpose to an occupant
or person in possession of the location designated in the warrant, and show him
or her the warrant, or a copy thereof, upon request. In executing a search
warrant, the personnel authorized to execute the warrant need not inform anyone
of his or her authority and purpose, as prescribed in the preceding sentence,
but may promptly enter the designated location if it is at the time unoccupied
or not in the possession of any person or at the time reasonably believed to be
in such condition, but shall orally announce their credentials and authority to
execute the warrant prior to entry.
      (3)   If any property is seized incident to the search, the officer shall
give the person from whose possession it was taken, if the person is present,
an itemized receipt for the property taken. If no such person is present, the
officer shall leave the receipt at the site of the search in a conspicuous
place. The return shall be accompanied by any photographs, copies or recordings
made, and by any property seized, along with a copy of the itemized receipt of
such property required by this section.
      (4)   The officer may summon as many persons as he or she deems necessary
to assist him or her in executing the warrant, and may request that a safety
and/or police officer assist in the execution of the warrant.

§ 23.001 PURPOSE
   The purpose of this chapter is to adopt rules governing the Board of
Commissioners in its proceedings for administering the financial affairs of the
city, and to establish a standard procedure for the making and administration
of budgets, to place responsibility for the tasks related to budget preparation
and administration, the determination of the amount of taxes and other revenues
in such manner that budgets may be balanced on the basis of actual cash
receipts within the budget period, the establishment of appropriations, the
payment of debt, and the control of other expenditures. Its provisions are
intended to enable the Board of Commissioners to make financial plans for both
current and capital expenditures, to insure that executive staffs administer
their respective functions in accordance with these plans, and to permit
taxpayers and investors to form intelligent opinions based on sufficient
information as to the financial policies and administration of the city. For
the accomplishment of this purpose, the provisions of this chapter shall be
broadly construed, and shall be in effect until repealed or amended. This
chapter may be repealed or amended by a majority vote of the Board of
Commissioners in the same manner as required by the Kentucky Revised Statutes
for the adoption of an ordinance.

   (E)   If it is determined during the advertising period that additional time
shall be allowed for the preparation of bids, the bid-opening date may be
extended by:
      (1)   Placing a notice specifying the revised bid-opening date in the
local newspaper with the largest circulation. The revised bid-opening date
shall be not less than seven (7) nor more than twenty-one (21) days after the
appearance of the legal notice; or
      (2)   Issue an addendum to the invitation for bids. The addendum must be
in writing, must be mailed or delivered to all holders of the invitation for
bids, and must be acknowledged on the form of proposal by each bidder
submitting a bid.
   (F)   An invitation for bids may be rescinded when:
      (1)   Conditions leading to the issuance of an invitation for bids change
sufficiently to make the proposed purchase unnecessary.
      (2)   Funds for the proposed purchase are unavailable.
      (3)   It is apparent no bids will be received because the item or service
is unavailable, bid prices will exceed the funds available for the item, and
when major revisions in specifications are necessary to insure bids received
will be responsive and responsible.
      (4)   It is determined by the City Manager that rescinding of invitations
to bid would be in the best interest of the city.
   (G)   Bidders may be required to submit bids on forms provided by the city.
Bids submitted on other forms may be rejected as nonresponsive.

(Ord. 89-6, passed 2-28-89)
______________

   Penalty for violation, see
§ 23.999
§ 23.301 METHODS FOR PROCUREMENT
   Procurements shall be made by one (1) of the following methods: small
purchase procedures, competitive sealed bids, competitive negotiation, or non-
competitive negotiation.
   (A)   Small purchases.
      (1)   Purchases of supplies, equipment, and services which cost between
two hundred dollars ($200.00) and ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) will
require written estimates but no legal advertisement is required. The city will
solicit written responses from at least three (3) vendors, and if no such
responses are available, a statement explaining the procurement will be
prepared and filed.
      (2)   Purchases which cost between fifty dollars ($50.00) and two hundred
dollars ($200.00) require three (3) over-the-telephone quotations of rate,
price, etc. A memorandum will be prepared setting forth the date the calls were
made, parties contacted, and prices obtained. For purchases of less than fifty
dollars ($50.00), efforts will be made to get the lowest and best price, but
written records of such efforts are not necessary.
   (B)   Competitive sealed bids.
      (1)   Bidding will be employed when detailed specifications for the goods
or services to be procured can be prepared and the primary basis for award is
cost. Then the cost of a contract, lease, or other agreement for materials,
supplies, equipment, or contractual services other than those personal or
professional exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), an Invitation for Bids
(hereinafter referred to as “IFB”) notice will generally be prepared. This
notice will be published at least once in at least one (1) official newspaper
of general circulation within the community. This newspaper notice will appear
not less than seven (7) days nor more than twenty-one (21) days before the due
date for bid proposals. The Mayor may also solicit sealed bids from responsible
prospective suppliers by sending them a copy of such notice.
      (2)   The IFB will include a general description of the goods or services
to be procured, the bid deposit and bond performance required (if applicable),
the location where bid forms and specifications may be secured, the time and
place for opening bids, and whether the bid award will be made on the basis of
the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated price. If the lowest evaluated
price is used, the measurable criteria to be utilized must be stated in the
IFB. The newspaper notice must also contain language which calls to the
attention of bidders all applicable requirements which must be complied with,
such as Section 3 of the 1968 Housing Act, Section 109 of the 1974 Housing and
Community Development Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11246,
and the Davis-Bacon Act.
      (3)   Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place stated
in the IFBs. The bids will be tabulated by the City Clerk/Treasurer at the time
of bid opening. The results of the tabulation and the bid documents will be
examined for accuracy and completeness by the review committee which will make
recommendations to the Board of Commissioners. In addition, the committee
determines that all firms are responsive and responsible. The Board of
Commissioners will make the decision as to whom the contract shall be awarded.
After the bid award is made by the Board of Commissioners, a contract will be
prepared for execution by the successful bidder. After the contract is signed,
all bid deposits will be returned to all unsuccessful bidders.
      (4)   The city may cancel an IFB or reject all bids if it is determined,
in writing, that such is in the best interests of the city. The city may allow
a vendor to withdraw a bid, if requested, at any time prior to the bid opening.
Bids received after the time set for bid opening shall be returned to the
vendor unopened.
   (C)   Competitive negotiation.
      (1)   The city will utilize competitive negotiations, regardless of
contract amount, upon a written determination that:
         (a)   Specifications cannot be made specific enough to permit the
award of a bid on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest
evaluated bid price (in other words, bidding is not feasible).
         (b)   The services to be procured are professional or personal in
nature.
      (2)   With the exception of procurement of certain professional services
(principally engineering services), competitive negotiations will proceed as
follows:
         (a)   Proposals will be solicited through newspaper advertisement;
additionally, a Request for Proposal (hereinafter referred to as “RFP”) may be
prepared and mailed to qualified vendors. The newspaper advertisement must be
published at least seven (7) days and not more than twenty-one (21) days before
the date for receipt of the proposals. The RFP will describe services needed
and identify the factors to be considered in the evaluation of proposals and
the relative weights assigned to each selection factor. The RFP will also state
where further details regarding the RFP may be obtained. The RFP will call
attention to the same regulations discussed in the bidding process. Requests
for proposals will always include cost as a selection factor.
         (b)   Award must be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined
in writing by a review committee to be the most advantageous to the city.
Evaluations must be based on the factors set forth in the RFP and a written
evaluation of each response prepared. The review committee may contact the
firms regarding their proposals for the purpose of clarification and record in
writing the nature of the clarification. If it is determined that no acceptable
proposal has been submitted, all proposals may be rejected. New proposals may
be solicited on the same or revised terms or the procurement may be abandoned.
      (3)   For the procurement of certain professional services, an
alternative to RFPs may be used. The city may publish a Request for
Qualifications (hereinafter referred to as “RFQs”). RFQs are handled in a
similar method to RFPs with the exception that cost is not a factor in the
initial evaluation. A review committee will evaluate the responses and rank
them by comparative qualifications. The highest scoring person or firm will be
contacted and the selection committee will negotiate cost. If the committee is
unable to negotiate a satisfactory cost arrangement, the second highest scoring
person or firm will be invited to negotiate. The committee will maintain a
written record of all such negotiations.
   (D)   Non-competitive negotiations.
      (1)   Non-competitive negotiations may be used for procurements in excess
of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) when bidding or competitive negotiations
are not feasible. The city may purchase goods and services through non-
competitive negotiations when it is determined, in writing, by the Mayor that
competitive negotiation or bidding is not feasible and that:
         (a)   An emergency exists which will cause public harm as a result of
the delay caused by following competitive purchasing procedures;
         (b)   The product or service can be obtained only from one (1) source;
         (c)   The contract is for the purchase of perishable items purchased
on a weekly or more frequent basis;
         (d)   Only one (1) satisfactory proposal is received through RFP or
RFQ; or
         (e)   The state has authorized the particular type of non-competitive
negotiation (e.g., the procurement of services by an Area Development
District).
      (2)   Procurement by non-competitive negotiation requires the strictest
attention to the observation of impartiality toward all suppliers. The Office
of Community Development must approve all procurements by non-competitive
negotiation when only one (1) supplier is involved or only one (1) bid or
response to an RFP/RFQ is received.

§ 23.302 CONTRACTS
   Generally, all procurement in excess of two hundred dollars ($200.00) will
be memorialized and supported by a written contract. Where it is not feasible
or impractical to prepare a contract, a written finding to this effect will be
prepared and some form of documentation regarding the transaction will also be
prepared. The contractual provisions required by OMB Circular A-102, Attachment
“O” will be included in all contracts.

orders, invoices, RFP/RFQ data, and bid materials ) will be retained and filed
in an appropriate manner. Where feasible, source documents pertinent to each
individual procurement shall be separately filed and maintained. Where it is
not feasible to maintain individual procurement files, source documents will be
filed and maintained in a reasonable manner (e.g., chronologically, by vendor,
by type of procurement, etc.). Whatever form of documentation and filing is
employed, the purpose of this section is to insure that a clear and consistent
audit trail is established. At a minimum, source document data must be
sufficient to establish the basis for selection, basis for cost (including the
issue of reasonableness of cost) and basis for payment.

liquid to enable the city to meet all operating requirements which might be
reasonably anticipated.

entity’s investment program.

§ 23.405 PRUDENT PERSON RULE
   (A)   The actions of the Finance Director in the performance of his or her
duties as manager of the city’s funds shall be evaluated using the “prudent
person” standard. Investments shall be made with judgment and care under

   (A)   As defined in §
27.001, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
27.107, any resident of the Commonwealth desiring to inspect or copy the public
records of the city shall make a request or complete a written application for
such records at the office of the City Clerk/Treasurer during regular office
hours, except during legal holidays. The Clerk/Treasurer may require the
applicant to provide a statement in the written application of the manner in
which the applicant is a resident of the Commonwealth under §
27.001. The application shall be hand- delivered, mailed, or sent via facsimile
or e-mail to the City Clerk/Treasurer’s office. A public agency shall not
require the use of any particular form for the submission of an open records
request, but shall accept for any request the standardized form developed under
KRS 61.876(4).
(KRS 61.872(2))
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a resident of the Commonwealth’s
request is in compliance with the open records law and the requested records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection. Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the
City Clerk/Treasurer for the inspection. No resident of the Commonwealth shall
remove original copies of public records from the offices of any public agency
without the written permission of the official custodian of the record.
(KRS 61.872(1))
   (C)   A resident of the Commonwealth may inspect public records during the
regular business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public
records from the city through the mail if the applicant’s residence or
principal place of business is outside of the county in which the city is
located and he has precisely described public records which are available
within the city. If the resident of the Commonwealth requesting the public
records requests that the records be mailed, the official custodian shall mail
the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of mailing.
(KRS 61.872(3))
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in
§ 27.001.
   (E)   Non-exempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency

this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of non-exempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of non-exempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requester stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requester to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing, and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requester was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section; or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio, or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly
allowed the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of
its publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission
for that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874(5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic format, as provided
under this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).

§ 25.203
§ 27.102 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE

available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records
not to exceed five (5) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 27.103 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of the public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 27.104 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify, in writing, the person making the request within the
five (5) day period of its decision. Any agency response delaying, in whole or
in part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian’s authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
(KRS 61.880(1))
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General’s request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General’s opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institute proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.
(KRS 61.880, 61.882)

reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW’s operation or for
violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
      (3)   The city may determine that an industrial user subject to
categorical pretreatment standards is a non-significant categorical industrial
user rather than a significant industrial user on a finding that the industrial
user never discharges more than one hundred (100) gallons per day (gpd) of
total categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and
boiler blowdown wastewater, unless specifically included in the pretreatment
standard) and the following conditions are met:

      (4)   Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in paragraph (2) of
this definition has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW’s
operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received
from an industrial user, and in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)
(6), determine that such user should not be considered a significant industrial
user.

(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.053 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS
   Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40
CFR Chapter I Subchapter N, Parts 405–471.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with subsections (E) and (F) below. See 40 CFR 403.6(c).
   (B)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Superintendent
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
   (C)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Superintendent
shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
   (D)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this subsection. See 40
CFR 403.15.
      (1)   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user’s intake water in accordance with
this subsection. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial
user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a “net” basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection are met.
      (2)   Criteria.
         (a)   Either (i) the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be
applied on a net basis; or (ii) the industrial user demonstrates that the
control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment
standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
         (b)   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the user’s effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
         (c)   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
subsection.
         (d)   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
   (E)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert
the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
Superintendent. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the
industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1)(a) and (1)
(e) below.
      (1)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
         (a)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility’s
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility’s long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         (d)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         (e)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user’s request
for equivalent mass limits.
      (2)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         (a)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         (b)   Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         (c)   Continue to record the facility’s production rates and notify
the Superintendent whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than
twenty percent (20%) from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph
(F)(1)(c) below. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the
Superintendent will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as
necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         (d)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph (1)(a)
above so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      (3)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Superintendent:
         (a)   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         (b)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (c)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user’s actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to §
33.055. The industrial user must also be in compliance with §
33.452 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   (F)   The Superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Superintendent.
   (G)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. See
40 CFR 403.6(c)(7).
   (H)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one (1) limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four- (4-) day average, limitations.
Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure
shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent
limitation. See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(8).
   (I)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall
notify the Superintendent within two (2) business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Superintendent of
such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration
limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term
average production rate. See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9).
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.054 STATE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS
   Users must comply with state pretreatment standards codified at 401 KAR 5:
057.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.055 LOCAL LIMITS
   (A)   The Superintendent is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to
40 CFR 403.5(c).
   (B)   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in
excess of the following:
0.68 mg/L Arsenic
0.030 mg/L Cadmium
1.00 mg/L Chromium, total
0.001 mg/L Mercury
0.40 mg/L Copper

0.10 mg/L Lead
1.20 mg/L Nickel
0.05 mg/L Selenium
0.10 mg/L Silver
1.21 mg/L Zinc
 
The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the
POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless
indicated otherwise. The Superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition
to the concentration-based limitations above.
   (C)   The Superintendent may develop best management practices (BMPs), by
ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits to
implement local limits and the requirements of § 33.050.
   (D)   The most stringent limit (federal, state or local) must be met by
permittee limit.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15; Am. Ord. 2022-15, passed 10-25-22)
§ 33.056 RIGHT OF REVISION

wastewater discharge permits or in general permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this
chapter.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.057 DILUTION
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
Division 3. Pretreatment of Wastewater
§ 33.100 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES

ordinance and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
33.050 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the
Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense.
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the
Superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans
and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.101 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual
wastewater discharge permit or a general permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
   (C)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall
be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the user at their
expense.
   (D)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.102 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG DISCHARGE CONTROL PLANS
   The Superintendent shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug
discharges. The Superintendent may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be
necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Superintendent may
develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge
control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
   (A)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
   (B)   Description of stored chemicals;
   (C)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by §
33.245; and
   (D)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.

§ 33.103 HAULED WASTEWATER
   (A)   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the Superintendent, and at such times as are established by the
Superintendent. Such waste shall not violate Division 2 of this chapter or any
other requirements established by the city. The Superintendent may require
septic tank waste haulers to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or
general permits.
   (B)   Any person who transports septic tank contents, seepage pit or other
batch liquid waste and wishes to discharge to the public sewer system shall
apply for a waste hauler discharge permit to the Superintendent. A fee of three
hundred dollars ($300.00) yearly is to be paid at the time of application. Upon
completion of the application, a discharge permit will be issued for a two (2)
year time period and will be renewed as existing permit expires. A fee of
twenty ($25.00) will be charged for each one thousand (1,000) gallons
discharged at the wastewater treatment plant. All persons receiving a waste
hauler discharge permit shall abide by all applicable provisions of this
article and any other special provisions that may be established by the
Superintendent as necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the
wastewater treatment plant. It shall be illegal to discharge any batch liquid
waste into any manhole or other part of the public sewer system, or any
building sewer or other facility that discharges to the public sewer system.
Any liquid waste hauler illegally discharging to the public sewer system shall
be subject to immediate revocation of the discharge permit and shall further be
subject to the enforcement actions prescribed in Division 11 of this chapter
and the penalties provided for in §
33.999. Nothing in this section shall relieve waste haulers of the
responsibility for compliance with the County Health Department, state or
federal regulations.

§ 33.155 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING: GENERAL PERMITS
   (A)   At the discretion of the Superintendent, the Superintendent may use
general permits to control SIU discharges to the POTW if the following
conditions are met. All facilities to be covered by a general permit must:
      (1)   Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
      (2)   Discharge the same types of wastes;
      (3)   Require the same effluent limitations;
      (4)   Require the same or similar monitoring; and
      (5)   In the opinion of the Superintendent, are more appropriately
controlled under a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge
permits.
   (B)   To be covered by the general permit, the SIU must file a written
request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production
processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all
wastes covered by the general permit, any requests in accordance with §
33.243(B) for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected
to be present in the discharge, and any other information the POTW deems
appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected
to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general permit until
after the Superintendent has provided written notice to the SIU that such a
waiver request has been granted in accordance with §
33.243(B).
   (C)   The Superintendent will retain a copy of the general permit,
documentation to support the POTW’s determination that a specific SIU meets the
criteria in §
33.155(A)(1) to (5) and applicable state regulations, and a copy of the user’s
written request for coverage for three (3) years after the expiration of the
general permit.
   (D)   The Superintendent may not control an SIU through a general permit
where the facility is subject to production-based categorical pretreatment
standards or categorical pretreatment standards expressed as mass of pollutant
discharged per day or for IUs whose limits are based on the combined
wastestream formula (§
33.053(C)) or net/gross calculations (§
33.053(D)).
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.156 APPLICATION SIGNATORIES AND CERTIFICATIONS
   (A)   All wastewater discharge permit applications, user reports and
certification statements must be signed by an authorized representative of the
user and contain the certification statement in §
33.253(A).
   (B)   If the designation of an authorized representative is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new written authorization satisfying the
requirements of this section must be submitted to the Superintendent prior to
or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
   (C)   A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial
user by the Superintendent pursuant to the subsection (3) of the definition of
“significant industrial user” in §
33.004 must annually submit the signed certification statement in §
33.253(B). See 40 CFR 403.3(v)(2).
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.157 INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE AND GENERAL PERMIT DECISIONS
   The Superintendent will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may
require additional information. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a
complete permit application, the Superintendent will determine whether to issue
an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit. The
Superintendent may deny any application for an individual wastewater discharge
permit or a general permit.

Division 6. Reporting Requirements
§ 33.240 BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS
   (A)   Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date
of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on
a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to the POTW shall submit to the Superintendent a report which contains
the information listed in subsection (B) below. At least ninety (90) days prior
to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the Superintendent a report which
contains the information listed in subsection (B) below. A new source shall
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
   (B)   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
      (1)   All information required in §§
33.154(A)(1)(a), (A)(2), (A)(3)(a), and (A)(6). See 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(7).

         (b)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
         (c)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an
alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40
CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted
to the control authority;
         (d)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with §
33.249;
         (e)   The Superintendent may allow the submission of a baseline report
which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
         (f)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
      (3)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user’s
authorized representative as defined in §
33.004 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
      (4)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule
pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in §
33.241.
      (5)   Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be certified in accordance with §
33.253(A) and signed by an authorized representative as defined in §
33.004.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.241 COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE PROGRESS REPORTS
   The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by
§
33.240(B)(4) above:
   (A)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
   (B)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
   (C)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no later
than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date
of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
   (D)   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Superintendent.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.242 REPORTS ON COMPLIANCE WITH CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD DEADLINE
   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Superintendent a report containing the information described in §§
33.154(A)(6) and (7) and
33.240(B)(2). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in Division 2 of this chapter
(see 40 CFR 403.6(c)), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
user’s long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include
the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
33.253(A). All sampling will be done in conformance with §
33.250.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.243 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS
   All SIUs are required to submit periodic compliance reports even if they
have been designated a non-significant categorical industrial user under the
provisions of §
33.243(C).
   (A)   Except as specified in §
33.243(C), all significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by
the Superintendent, submit no less than twice per year, on dates specified,
reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge
which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP)
or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation
required by the Superintendent or the pretreatment standard necessary to
determine the compliance status of the user.
   (B)   The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. (See 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2).) This
authorization is subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit. See §
33.154(A)(8).
      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one (1) sampling of the
facility’s process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility
that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.
      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with §
33.004, and include the certification statement in §
33.253(A) (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)).
      (5)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Superintendent must be
included as a condition in the user’s permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Superintendent for three (3) years after expiration of the
waiver.
      (7)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user’s
permit by the Superintendent, the industrial user must certify on each report
with the statement in §
33.253(C) below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
wastestream due to activities of the industrial user.
      (8)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user’s operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of §
33.243(A), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
Superintendent, and notify the Superintendent.
      (9)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
   (C)   The city may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance reports
(see §
33.243(A) (40 CFR 403.12(e)(1)) to a requirement to report no less frequently
than twice a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard
or by the EPA/State Division of Water, where the industrial user’s total
categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:
      (1)   POTW’s value for one one-hundredths percent (0.01%) of the POTW’s
design dry-weather hydraulic capacity of the POTW, or five thousand (5,000)
gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent
flow monitoring device unless the industrial user discharges in batches.
      (2)   POTW’s value for one one-hundredths percent (0.01%) of the design
dry-weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and
      (3)   POTW’s value for one one-hundredths percent (0.01%) of the maximum
allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable
categorical pretreatment standard for which approved local limits were
developed in accordance with §
33.053. Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in the
last two (2) years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in §
33.290. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an industrial user
with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so
significantly that, in the opinion of the Superintendent, decreasing the
reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are
not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
   (D)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
33.253.
   (E)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (F)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Superintendent, using the procedures prescribed
in §
33.250, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. See 40
CFR 403.12(g)(6).
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.244 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS
   Each user must notify the Superintendent of any significant changes to the
user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of
its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change.
   (A)   The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
33.154.
   (B)   The Superintendent may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit
or a general permit under §
33.206 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit or a general permit
under §
33.204 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.245 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   Within thirty (30) days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Superintendent
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.

§ 33.247 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not
required if the city performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a
month, or if the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the
initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives
the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and
analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.248 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one
hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180)
days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this section need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under §
33.244. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
33.240,
33.242, and
33.243.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (A) above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one- (1-) time notification. Subsequent months during which the
user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.249 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments
thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the Superintendent or other parties approved
by EPA.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.250 SAMPLE COLLECTION
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   (A)   Except as indicated in subsections (B) and (C) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using twenty-four- (24-) hour flow-proportional
composite or twenty-four- (24-) hour time proportional composite sampling
techniques, The samples must be representative of the discharge. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-
(24-) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. See
40 CFR 403.12(g)(3).
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day
(90-) day compliance reports required in §
33.240 and
33.242 (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by §
33.243 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. (See 40 CFR 403.12(g)
(4).)

§ 33.252 RECORDKEEPING
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated
with best management practices established under § 33.053(C). Records shall
include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of
the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user
has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Superintendent.

Division 10. Administrative Enforcement Remedies
§ 33.300 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that
user a written notice of violation. Within (14) days of the receipt of such
notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the Superintendent. Submission of such a plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions
or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.301 CONSENT ORDERS
   The Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance,
or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible
for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by
the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
33.303 and
33.304 and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.302 SHOW CAUSE HEARING
   The Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Superintendent and
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least (14) days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user
as defined in §
33.004 and required by §
33.156(A). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.303 COMPLIANCE ORDERS
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance
within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.304 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are
likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it
to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.305 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may fine such user in
an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). Such fines shall be
assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other
long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during
the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after (90) calendar days,
be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid balance,
and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of five percent (5%) per month.
A lien against the user’s property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines,
and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within fourteen (14) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the Superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event
the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Superintendent may add the
costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.306 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS
   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
   (A)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Superintendent
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings in §
33.307 are initiated against the user.
   (B)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §§
33.302 or
33.307. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.307 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE
   In addition to the provisions in §
33.205, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
   (A)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit
conditions;
   (B)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   (C)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   (D)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   (E)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Division 2 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under §
33.302 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
Division 11. Judicial Enforcement Remedies
§ 33.350 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may petition the
Bourbon County Court through the City’s Attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, the
general permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on
activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.

per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit,
penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   (B)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
   (C)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
   (D)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

   (A)   A notice of violation shall be assessed to any user for each day that
a report required by this chapter, a permit or order issued hereunder is late,
beginning ten (10) days after the date the report is due. Reports that are more
than thirty (30) days late will result in an administrative order to submit
with a fine of no more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per additional
day.
   (B)   Actions taken by the Superintendent to collect late reporting
penalties shall not limit the Superintendent’s authority to initiate other

   The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater
discharge permit or a general permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this chapter, a previous individual wastewater discharge
permit, or a previous general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a
satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the Superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.402 LIABILITY INSURANCE

§ 33.404 WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE
   Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a general permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water
service to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user’s
expense, only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to
comply.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
Division 13. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations
§ 33.450 UPSET
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident
in which here is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection (C) below, are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five (5) days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.451 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
33.050(A) or the specific prohibitions in §§
33.050(B)(3) through (18) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 2015-12, passed 8-7-15)
§ 33.452 BYPASS
   (A)   For the purposes of this section:
      (1)   Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user’s treatment facility.
      (2)   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of subsections (C) and (D) below.
   (C)   Bypass notifications.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least fourteen (14) days before
the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty-four (24) hours.
   (D)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (D)(1) of this section.

   (B)   For residential, industrial, institutional, and commercial users,
monthly user charges will be based on actual water usage. If a residential,
commercial, institutional, or industrial user has a consumptive use of water,
or, in some other manner, uses water which is not discharged into the
wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based
on readings of a wastewater meter(s) or separate water meter(s) installed and
maintained at the user’s expense.
   (C)   For those users whose wastewater has a greater strength than normal
domestic wastewater, a surcharge, in addition to the normal user charge, will
be collected.
      (1)   Surcharge rates.  The following surcharge rates shall apply to each
user of the treatment works that has received permission from the
Superintendent or designated authority to contribute excessive strength sewage:
   Pollutant            Surcharge Rates
   CBOD               $0.40 per pound over limit
   TSS               $0.40 per pound over limit
   NH3N               $0.75 per pound over limit
   Oil and grease            $0.29 per pound over limit
In addition, a twenty-five-dollar ($25.00) fee shall be imposed for any Ph.
This fee shall be imposed for each violation.
      (2)   Method of billing surcharges. The excessive strength surcharge
shall be based on a formula pursuant to subsection (D) below, with the total
applied to the monthly bill of affected users.
   (D)   Example formula. (Pollutant concentration-pollutant limit) x 8.34 x
surcharge rate for that pollutant x monthly flow in one million gallons.
      (1)   Where formula components are as follows:
         (a)   Surcharge rate for CBOD, in $/pound.
         (b)   Surcharge rate of TSS, in $/pound.
         (c)   Surcharge rate for other pollutant(s) in $/pound.
         (d)   User’s average CBOD concentration in mg/l.
         (e)   User’s average TSS concentration, in mg/l.
         (f)   User’s average other pollutants concentration, in mg/l.
         (g)   User’s monthly flow to wastewater works, per 1,000 gallons.
      (2)   No reduction in wastewater service charges, fees, or taxes shall be
permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the wastewater
works contain less than 250 mg/l of CBOD, 300 mg/l of SS, or 30 mg/l of other
pollutant(s) (NH3N).

§ 33.604 REVENUE RECORDS; REVIEW
   (A)   The city shall maintain financial records to accurately account for
revenues generated by the treatment system and expenditures for operation and
maintenance of the system, including normal replacement costs.
   (B)   The city shall review, not less often than annually, the wastewater
contribution of users, the total cost of the wastewater works, debt service
obligations, and user charge rates. Based on such review, the city shall
revise, when necessary, the schedule of user charge rates to accomplish the
following.
      (1)   Maintain an equitable distribution of OM&R costs among users of the
treatment system; and
      (2)   Generate sufficient revenues to offset costs associated with the
proper operation and maintenance of the wastewater system and to meet debt
service requirements.
      (3)   Excessive strength and toxicity surcharges shall be reviewed at the
time of and in conjunction with the review of user charges. Surcharge rates
shall be revised where necessary to reflect current treatment and monitoring
costs.
      (4)   Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with
a regular bill of the rate that that portion of the total charge which is
attributable to OM&R of the wastewater system.
(Ord. 98-17, passed 8-18-98)
§ 33.605 BILLING
   All users shall be billed monthly. Billings for any particular month shall
be made within ten (10) days after the end of the month. Payments are due
within fifteen (15) days after the end of the month. Any payment not received
within ten (10) days after the fifteenth of the month shall be considered
delinquent and disconnected for non-payment.

against the owner of the property.
   (I)   The provisions of subsections (D), (F), and (H) of this section shall
not apply to an owner, occupant, or person having control or management of any

   (A)   Any property within the city which is a chronic nuisance property is
declared a public nuisance and in violation of this article and subject to the

§ 50.302 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE FOR CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTIES
   (A)   When the Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her designee(s), receives
information documenting the existence of activities which qualify as nuisance
activities:
      (1)   The Code Enforcement Officer or Police Chief, or their designee(s),
shall independently review the information to determine whether a chronic
nuisance property, as defined herein in § 50.300, is established by the
information; and
      (2)   Upon such determination, the Code Enforcement Officer or Police
Chief, or their designee(s), shall issue a notice of violation to the person
responsible for such property, in writing, that the property is in danger of
being declared a chronic nuisance property.
   (B)   The notice shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property;
      (2)   A concise statement that the property has been determined to be a
chronic nuisance property with a description of the nuisance activities leading
to the determination;
      (3)   A demand that the person responsible for such property respond to
the notice within ten days of service of the notice by describing the actions
the person intends to take to abate the nuisance activities (an abatement
plan), or indicating good cause as to why the responsible person cannot abate
the nuisance activities;
      (4)   Advising that an abatement plan must be reached with the Code
Enforcement Officer or his or her designee within 30 days from the date of the
notice of determination of chronic nuisance property;
      (5)   That if the nuisance activities are not abated or good cause for
failure to abate is not shown, a citation may be issued;
      (6)   That permitting the existence of a chronic nuisance property is a
violation of this article;
      (7)   That the above remedies are in addition to those otherwise provided
by law; and
      (8)   A statement describing that the property could be subject to
closure and civil penalties and/or costs assessed up to two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per day if the property is declared a chronic nuisance
property.
   (C)   The notice may be delivered in person or sent registered mail with
return receipt requested. The notice may be delivered to the property itself,
or to the mailing address of the owner of the property as listed on city tax
roll or to any other address that is likely to give the person responsible
notice of the determination and notice of violation. Failure of the person to
receive the notice shall not invalidate or otherwise alter the proceedings
under this article.
   (D)   Failure to respond, failure to abate the nuisance activities, or
failure to propose an abatement plan shall be prima facie evidence of lack of
cooperativeness of the person responsible. Failure to implement or comply with
any abatement plan shall be prima facie evidence of an absence of good faith in
mitigating or connecting the chronic nuisance violation.
   (E)   The Code Enforcement Officer or his or her designee may issue a
citation if:
      (1)   The responsible person fails to respond within ten days from the
date of notice of violation and chronic nuisance property determination; or
      (2)   No agreeable written abatement plan is reached within 30 days from
the notice of violation and determination of chronic nuisance property by the
Code Enforcement Officer or his or her designee and the responsible person
fails to establish one of the affirmative defenses provided in the exception
stated in division (3) of the definition of “NUISANCE ACTIVITY OR ACTIVITIES”
in §
50.300, divisions (G), (H) or (I) of this section; or
      (3)   The responsible person fails to abate the nuisance activities from
the property as required by the agreed abatement plan; or
      (4)   The responsible person fails to comply with all conditions of the
written abatement plan for a period of one year.
   (F)   A timely response and statement from a responsible person does not
constitute an admission that any nuisance activities have occurred or are
occurring but may be used as evidence and considered by any trier of fact for
any purpose.
   (G)   Landlord’s affirmative defense. A residential landlord has an
affirmative defense to a violation under this article if they establish by a
preponderance of the evidence that the basis for the charge is the actions or
omissions of a tenant(s) and the residential landlord establishes the
following: that the residential landlord, upon written notice by the city that
a nuisance activity has occurred on the property within the prior three months,
commences an eviction action against the tenant whose action or omission forms
the basis of the charge, and diligently prosecutes that action to completion,
irrespective of any ultimate ruling by a court on the merits of the action.
   (H)   Good cause affirmative defense. Any person charged under this article
has an affirmative defense to a violation under this article if they establish
by a preponderance of the evidence that:
      (1)   The responsible person has taken all actions to deter and prevent
the nuisance activity that formed the basis of the violation;
      (2)   The nuisance activity that forms the basis of the citation was not
the result of the actions or omissions of the responsible person, their
authorized guests, tenants or any other person residing in their household; and
      (3)   The nuisance activity that forms the basis of the citation was not
suffered, permitted or tolerated by the responsible person.

responsible person shall have those rights and be subject to the procedures and
provisions set forth in §§
22.600 et seq. of this Code of Ordinances. If the Code Enforcement Board finds
that the real property is a chronic nuisance property, then it shall issue such
civil fine or order any other action consistent with the provisions of §§
22.600 et seq.
   (B)   Whenever the Code Enforcement Board finds, or a citation is not
appealed, that a chronic nuisance property exists, the Board or Code
Enforcement Official shall forward the finding to the City Manager. Based on
such determination, the City Manager may suspend or revoke any occupational
license and rental license of any person conducting any business upon the
chronic nuisance property.
(Ord. 2013-12, passed 12-10-13)
§ 50.304 SUMMARY CLOSURE
   The city may also initiate a summary closure proceeding in Bourbon District
and/or Circuit Court. Such an action shall be based on evidence showing that
Nuisance Activities exist and have occurred on the property and that action is
necessary to avoid a threat to public welfare and safety. Proceedings to obtain
an order of summary closure shall be governed by applicable Kentucky law for
obtaining temporary restraining orders. In the event of summary closure, the
city is not required to comply with the notification procedures of §§
22.600 et seq. As part of any summary closure order, the Court may revoke or
suspend the occupational license of any person conducting business upon the
property where the chronic nuisance exists.

and vacate upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the nuisance
activity has been abated and will not be maintained or permitted on the
property or a unit thereof.
(Ord. 2013-12, passed 12-10-13)
§ 50.307 LIEN
   Pursuant to the provisions KRS 381.770, the city shall possess a lien
against the property for all fines, penalties, charges and fees imposed and for
the reasonable value of labor and materials used to abate the nuisance
activity. The lien shall be superior to and have priority over all other liens
on the property except state, county, school board and city taxes, and may be
enforced by judicial proceeding.

   (A)    Except as provided in subsection (D) of this section, net profits

      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profits by a fraction, the

sales factor, described in subsection (C) of this section, and the denominator
of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the net profits by the sales factor as set forth in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's

factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental

time spent in performing such income producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly

business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
       (1)    Separate accounting;

performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the

as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the

verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational

the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

shall be assessed and a notice of assessment mailed to the business entity by

      (1)    In the case of a failure to file a return or of a fraudulent
return the additional tax may be assessed at any time.
      (2)    In the case of a return where a business entity understates net
profit, or omits an amount properly includable in net profits, or both, which

determination of the federal audit from the business entity, whichever is
later.
      (4)   The times provided in this subsection may be extended by agreement
between the business entity and the city. For the purposes of this section, a
return filed before the last day prescribed by law for filing the return shall

of the affairs of any person, or information regarding the tax schedules,
returns, or reports required to be filed with the city or other proper officer,
or any information produced by a hearing or investigation, insofar as the
information may have to do with the affairs of the person's business. This
prohibition does not extend to information required in prosecutions for making

of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or his or her duly authorized agent all such
information and rights to inspect any of the books and records of the city if
the Commissioner of Revenue of the state grants to the city the reciprocal
right to obtain information form the files and records of the Kentucky
Department of Revenue and maintains the privileged character of the information
so furnished. Provided, further, that the city may publish statistics based on
such information in such a manner as not to reveal data respecting net profits
or compensation of any person.
   (C)    In addition, the city is empowered to execute similar reciprocity
agreements as described in division (B) with any other taxing entity, should
there be a need for exchange of information in order to effect diligent
enforcement of this chapter.

of a felony, a misdemeanor for which imprisonment or other confinement was a
possible penalty, any other crime in which moral turpitude was involved; or any
other crime which was directly related to a business of the type which is the
subject of the application. In determining if a conviction was directly related
to a business, the City Manager shall consider:

convicted.
         (b)   The relationship of the crime to the purpose of the regulation

that the operation, unless closely supervised, has a probability of generating
or resulting in criminal activity or adversely affecting the health, safety,

citizens and residents of the city, or will constitute a nuisance.
      (4)   The City Manager shall consider the business history of the

identified in the application are indebted to the city for delinquent taxes,
assessments, liens, fines, penalties, or similar obligations.
      (6)   The City Manager shall consider whether the business and the
proposed location complies with all applicable laws, including, without

approves or disapproves the application for an occupational license within
thirty (30) days after the application has been received by or on behalf of the
city, the City Clerk, or the designee thereof, shall issue the occupational
license that is the subject of the application and mail it to the applicant at
the address indicated in the application; and, thereafter, the applicant may
engage in the franchise, trade, occupation, profession, or other business
described in the application, but only at the address thereof indicated in the
application, until that occupational license expires or is suspended or revoked
according to the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Conditional approval of application. In the event that the City

indicated in the application, along with, a notice that the license will be
issued by the City Clerk only upon receipt by the City Clerk of a written
signed acceptance by the applicant of the conditions to be performed prior to
the issuance of the license. The notice shall also state that if the City Clerk
does not receive the acceptance within such time, the application will thereby
be summarily disapproved.
   (F)   Disapproval of application. In the event that the City Manager
disapproves an application for an occupational license required hereby, the
City Clerk shall notify the applicant of that denial and the reasons therefore
identified by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the
applicant indicated in the application, with a refund of any anticipated city
occupational license fee paid with the application, and a notice of the
procedure established in this chapter for an appeal from the denial of that
application.
   (G)   Occupational license revocation or suspension by the City Manager.
      (1)   Any occupational license required hereby may be revoked or
suspended by the City Manager for any period of time determined by the City
Manager to be reasonable and appropriate for any one (1) or more of the

turpitude is involved, or any other crime which directly relates to a business
of the type for which the license was issued. However, the consideration of
such a criminal conviction shall include:
            1.   The nature and seriousness of the crime for which the person
was convicted.
            2.   The relationship of the crime to the purposes of the
regulation of the business.
            3.   The relationship of the crime to the ability, capacity and
fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of
the operation of the business.

license, permit, degree, certification or similar document which is required by

indecent or immoral acts to be committed therein, or on the premises adjacent
thereto and under the control of the person conducting such business, or to
permit on such premises or adjacent premises any lewd, boisterous or obscene
conversations, sounds or other noises, or to permit such premises to be used

premises of the licensee, or under the control thereof.

circumstances of revocation or suspension described within subsection (a) above
with regard to any application for occupational license or anybody mentioned
therein, the City Manager or his or her designee shall attempt informally to
contact the applicant at either the address set forth within the application or
the telephone number set forth therein, and, if the contact attempt is
successful: (1) disclose said circumstances to the applicant, (2) indicate to
the applicant that if the circumstances are shown to the City Manager to be
accurate, then the occupational license may be revoked or suspended by the City
Manager, (3) request that the applicant confirm or deny the truth of the
circumstances, and (4) obtain any explanation or evidence from the applicant
with regard to the presence or absence of the circumstances. One (1) of the
attempts to contact the applicant shall consist of a letter of notification
sent to the applicant at the address set forth within the application by
certified mail, return receipt requested. The City Manager may decide whether
or not to revoke or suspend an occupational license after his or her attempts
to contact the application are deemed unsuccessful (including the applicant's

for the letter of notification.
      (3)   After considering the evidence of the existence of the

more of the circumstances described within subsection (1) exists.

under this section shall be in addition to the imposition of any other remedy
or penalty prescribed under this chapter or other applicable law.

   (A)   The fee for an itinerant merchant’s permit shall be $75.00, which
permit shall entitle the itinerant merchant to transact such business within

merchant’s permit shall extend beyond the close of the calendar year in which
it was obtained. Each permit shall bear the dates within the calendar year when
the itinerant business is authorized to conduct business within the city
pursuant to the permit. Should an itinerant business desire to conduct business
within the city during any subsequent calendar year, it must renew the
transient merchant’s permit for that calendar year in accordance with these
sections of the Code of Ordinances, or apply for a regular occupational license

or a civic organization, shall not be required to procure a permit as to its
participation in such a function or event, and the entity putting on the
function or event shall be entitled to retain such event fee as it may assess
to the itinerant merchant. However, that entity shall itself be required to
obtain from the city a business event license for each such event at a cost of
$100.00, which fee shall be in lieu of the permit fees that would otherwise be
payable by all participating itinerant merchants.

§ 65.001 SCOPE; APPLICABILITY
   (A)   This chapter governs the regulations of rates for basic cable service
and equipment within the city for any franchisee which has been notified that:
      (1)   The city has been certified to regulate its basic service and
equipment rates; and
      (2)   The city has adopted regulations governing regulation of basic
service and equipment rates.
   (B)   The provisions set forth below are intended to be consistent with all
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations governing the regulation of
basic service rates and equipment, and the city will regulate and interpret its
rules so that they are consistent with the FCC regulations, as if those
regulations were set forth in full herein.
   (C)   The franchisee is prohibited from engaging in any activity prohibited
under FCC rules, as if those rules were set forth in full herein.
(Ord. 93-44, passed 9-19-93)
§ 65.002 DEFINITIONS
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context indicates or clearly requires a different meaning.
   “BASIC CABLE SERVICE.” Has the same meaning as the term “BASIC SERVICE” at
47 CFR § 76.901.
   “EQUIPMENT.” Refers to all equipment and services subject to regulation
under 47 CFR § 76.923.
(Ord. 93-44, passed 9-19-93)
§ 65.003 INITIAL FILINGS BY FRANCHISEES
   (A)   Filings; when made. A franchisee that is notified that its basic
service and equipment rates are subject to regulation must file a submission
(“the rate filing”) within thirty (30) days of the notification, justifying its
then-existing basic service and equipment rates. All rates for all customer
classifications must be justified. Once a franchisee has been notified by the
city that its rates are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter increase
its rates for basic service or equipment without the prior approval of the
city. This requirement applies in all cases, including with respect to
increases in rates announced prior to the date the operator was notified its
rates were subject to regulation, where the increases were not implemented
prior to the date of notice. A franchisee must submit a rate filing to justify
any increase in basic service or equipment rates or any new basic service or
equipment rate (collectively referred to herein as “rate increases”). An
increase occurs when there is an increase in rates or a decrease in program or
customer services. Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be
filed for review at least thirty (30) days in advance of the proposed effective
date of the increase. This requirement does not alter or eliminate any other
notice requirement.
   (B)   Filings; where made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the City
Manager. A rate filing shall be considered filed for review on the date the
required rate filing and all required copies are received by the City Manager.
Five (5) copies of each rate filing, including all supporting materials, must
be submitted. If the operator claims any part of the filing is proprietary, it
shall additionally file five (5) copies that omit the proprietary information.
   (C)   Filing; contents. Subject to any FCC regulations governing the burden
of proof, a rate filing submitted by a franchisee must show that the rates the
franchisee proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable.
Except as inconsistent with FCC rules:
      (1)   Every rate filing must clearly state, in a cover letter, whether it
justifies existing rates or proposes an increase in rates. The cover letter
must also identify any rate that is derived, in whole or in part, based upon
cost of service and identify any pages of the rate filing that contain
information the franchisee claims is proprietary. It must state whether any
part of the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment or an alleged
increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain a brief
narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service.
      (2)   The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially.
      (3)   The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms, and these
forms must be correctly completed.
      (4)   If different rates are proposed for basic service for different
classes of customers, the filing must show that the classifications and the
differences in the rates charged are reasonable and consistent with federal
law.
   (D)   If the franchisee seeks to support a rate based upon a cost of
service, the city will establish a rate that provides the franchisee an
opportunity to recover the reasonable costs associated with providing basic
cable service, including a reasonable profit. An expense or investment is not
presumed reasonable merely because the franchisee has incurred or made it. A
franchisee is not entitled to recover monopoly profits in any form.
   (E)   In addition to the information the city requires the franchisee to
provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee
who seeks to justify all or any part of its rates based upon its cost of
service must submit a complete cost of service analysis that shows all expenses
it incurs and all revenues derived from the system, directly or indirectly, by
the franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator of the system
within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 522(4). The cost of service must identify the
accounting level (as that term is used in the FCC’s regulations) at which each
expense or revenue identified was aggregated and show clearly how the expense
or revenue was allocated. The franchisee may not include costs at an accounting
level unless it also includes all revenues from that same level attributable to
the system or to a group of systems of which the system services the city as a
part. The replacement cost of a comparable system must be identified and
supported. The franchisee must identify the name and address of any entity with
which it has a contract, other than a programmer, which derives revenues from
the system and must state whether and how the revenues of that entity were
included in the cost of service. In addition, the cost of service shall clearly
show the derivation of a proposed charge per channel and the application of
that charge to yield a basic service rate. It must also show and support the
derivation and allocation of any amounts included in the derivation of the rate
for:
      (1)   Operation and maintenance expenses;
      (2)   Administrative and general expenses;
      (3)   Programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs and
copyright fees separately);
      (4)   Costs for PEG access and any institutional network;
      (5)   Franchisee fee expenses;
      (6)   Investment in the system and associated depreciation;
      (7)   Other expenses, including federal, state, and local taxes,
itemized; and
      (8)   The proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid by
the franchisee.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee is not required to submit
the cost of service specified in subsection (E) for equipment rates but instead
initially shall complete, submit, and support the costs of equipment using
applicable FCC forms. Any cost of service submitted to justify basic service
rates must show that the cost of service does not include equipment costs.

§ 65.004 INITIAL CITY REVIEW
   (A)   After receiving a rate filing, the City Manager shall promptly publish
a notice that a filing has been received and that, except for those parts which
may be withheld as proprietary, it is available for public review. The notice
shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing and shall provide
interested parties seven (7) days to submit written comments on the filing to
the City Manager. The City Manager shall submit the comments received and its
recommendations for action to the Board of Commissioners no longer than twenty
(20) days after the filing and shall make those recommendations available for
public inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or
staff recommendations but must do so no later than three (3) business days
after the staff recommendations are submitted to the Board of Commissioners.
The response shall be filed with the City Manager, and, if submitted in a
timely fashion, the City Manager shall forward a copy to the Board of
Commissioners.
   (B)   Within thirty (30) days of the date of the filing, the Board of
Commissioners shall issue a written order which may be in any lawful form
approving the proposed rate in whole or in part, denying the proposed rate in
whole or in part, or tolling the proposed rate in whole or in part. If the
Board of Commissioners tolls the rate, in whole or in part, its written order
at a minimum shall explain that it requires additional time to review the rate
filing and state that the franchisee may cure any deficiency in its filing by
submitting a filing as provided in
§ 65.005. With respect to existing rates, tolling means the rates may remain in
effect, subject to refund; with respect to rate changes, tolling means the
portion of the rate change that is tolled may not go into effect.
(Ord. 93-44, passed 9-19-93)

   Public records, see
Ch. 27
§ 65.005 SUPPLEMENTARY FILINGS
   (A)   If a proposed rate is tolled, in whole or in part, the franchisee
shall submit a supplementary filing twenty (20) days from the effective date of
the tolling order containing corrections, if any, to its filing, including any
required supplement to its cost of service filing, and any response to
information filed by interested parties or to the recommendations of the staff,
or any additional information necessary to support the proposed rate.
Supplementary filings must be filed in accordance with
§ 65.003(B).
   (B)   A supplementary filing also must contain such information as the city
directs the franchisee to provide.
   (C)   In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to
provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee
who claims that it is entitled to a rate, in whole or in part, based upon the
adjustments for inflation and external costs contemplated by 47 CFR § 76.922(d)
(1) - (2), must submit the following:
      (1)   A calculation showing how each part of the adjustment was derived;
      (2)   A statement itemizing each external cost (as defined in FCC
regulations), the amount of that external cost for the two (2) calendar years
prior to the date of the filing and the y ear-to-date in which the filing is
made; and the projected amount of the external cost for the remainder of the
year in which the filing is made and for the following calendar year. The
statement must specifically show any increases in revenues from programming
services. Revenues include all revenues, in whatever form received.
      (3)   If the increase is attributable to any increase in programming
service costs, the contract for each programming service whose cost has
increased; a sworn statement identifying each programming service whose costs
increased where the programmer is an affiliate of the franchisee (as defined by
FCC regulations); and, for any contract that has been in effect less than
twelve (12) months, the prior contract for the service.
      (4)   A sworn statement by the franchisee’s chief financial officer or an
independent certified accountant stating that he or she has examined all
external costs, including all programming costs, and has offset against any
increase claimed the amount of any decreases in external costs and the amount
by which any increase in external costs was below the GNP-PI, as required by 47
CFR § 76.922(d)(2); affirming that the franchisee has only sought to recover
any external cost to the extent that cost exceeded the GNP-PI; and affirming
that the franchisee has not attempted to recover any increase in the cost of
programming purchased by an affiliate except as provided in 47 CFR § 76.922(d)
(2)(vi).
   (D)   Upon receiving the supplementary filing, the City Manager shall
promptly publish a notice that a filing has been received and that it is
available for public review, except those parts which may be withheld as
proprietary. The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the
filing and shall provide interested parties twenty (20) days to submit written
comments on the filing to the City Manager. The City Manager shall submit the
comments received no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date the Board of
Commissioners must act under subsection (G).
   (E)   The recommendations shall be made available for public inspection. The
franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations
but must do so no later than ten (10) days after the staff recommendations are
submitted to the Board of Commissioners. The response shall be filed with the
City Manager, and, if submitted in a timely fashion, the City Manager shall
forward a copy to the Board of Commissioners.
   (F)   The Board of Commissioners shall issue a written order which may be in
any lawful form approving the proposed rate, in whole or in part; denying the
proposed rate, in whole or in part; or allowing the rate to go into effect, in
whole or in part, subject to refund. If the Board of Commissioners issues an
order allowing the rates to go into effect subject to refund, it shall also
direct the franchisee to maintain an accounting in accordance with 47 CFR §
76.933.
   (G)   The order specified in subsection (E) shall be adopted within ninety
(90) days after the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justifies based
on the FCC benchmark. The order shall be adopted within one hundred fifty (150)
days of the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justified with a cost of
service showing.

§ 65.006 PROVISIONS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO RATE ORDERS
   (A)   Any rate order of the Board of Commissioners shall be issued and
effective upon adoption. Each rate order shall be released to the public and
the franchisee. In any case where the Board of Commissioners approves, denies,
or tolls a rate; orders that a rate may go into effect subject to refund; or
orders, refunds, or establishes rates, a public notice shall be published
stating that the order has issued and is available for review. Any such order
shall be in writing.
   (B)   The Board of Commissioners may take any steps that it is not
prohibited from taking by federal law to protect the public interest as part of
any rate order or by any other means. By way of illustration and not
limitation, it may require refunds, set rates, and impose forfeitures and
penalties directly or through its delegated representatives and enforce refund
orders. Any order prescribing a rate must explain why the franchisee’s proposed
rate was unreasonable and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However,
before prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to subscribers, the Board of
Commissioners shall ensure the franchisee has had notice and opportunity to
comment on the proposed rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the City
Manager propose a refund or a rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation
to the franchisee at the time it is submitted to the Board of Commissioners
shall be deemed to provide the franchisee this notice and the franchisee must
commend on the refund or rate in its response to the recommendations.
   (C)   No order approving or setting a rate using the FCC benchmark shall be
interpreted to establish the just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every
such rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and
refund to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the
same may be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not
limitation, should the FCC reduce the benchmark, the city shall have the right
to reduce a franchisee’s rates and to require the franchisee to refund any
amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by
federal law.

§ 65.007 FRANCHISEE’S DUTIES
   (A)   A franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including
prospective rate reductions and refunds, within sixty (60) days of the date the
Board of Commissioners issues an order mandating a remedy.
   (B)   Within ninety (90) days of the date an order mandating a remedy is
issued, a franchisee must file a certification signed by an authorized
representative of the cable company stating:
      (1)   Whether the franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of
the Board of Commissioners’ order;
      (2)   Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the
Board of Commissioners’ order;
      (3)   Showing how refunds, including interest, were calculated and
distributed.
   (B)   It is each franchisee’s responsibility to keep books and records of
account so that it can refund any amount owed to subscribers.
   (C)   It is each franchisee’s duty to submit as complete a filing as
possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing that is
incomplete under applicable law shall be treated as an evasion of this chapter.
   (D)   Information requests.
      (1)   A franchisee and any other entity that has records of revenues or
expenses that are allocated to the franchisee’s system must respond to requests
for information from the city by deadlines established by the city. A
franchisee is responsible for ensuring that such other entity responds to the
city’s requests.
      (2)   Because federal law limits the time available for an initial
response to a filing by a franchisee, before the order contemplated by
§ 65.004 issues, the franchisee must be prepared to respond to requests for
information regarding its filing within five (5) days of the date an
information request is mailed to it. The information may include the
information the franchisee would be required to provide as part of any
supplementary filing.

      (1)   Ensure notices are given to the public and each franchisee as
required herein and by FCC regulations;
      (2)   May submit requests for information to the franchisee and establish
deadlines for response to them, as provided in
§ 65.007;
      (3)   May waive any provision herein, for good cause, or extend any
deadline for filing or response, except as to such matters that are mandatory
under FCC regulations;
      (4)   Shall rule on any request for confidentiality; and
      (5)   Shall prepare the recommendations to the Board of Commissioners
contemplated by
§ 65.004 -
65.005. If the City Manager recommends that any increase be denied in whole or
in part, he shall:
         (a)   Propose a rate and explain the basis for his recommendation;
propose that rates remain at existing levels;
         (b)   Recommend whether and on what basis refunds should issue; and
         (c)   Notify the franchisee of his recommendation at the time it is

§ 65.009 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION
   (A)   If these provisions or any request for information requires the
production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the
information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is
submitted, a franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its
response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The
request must state the reason why the information should be treated as
proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for
confidentiality will be granted if the city determines that the preponderance
of the evidence shows that non-disclosure is consistent with the provisions of
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 522. The city shall place in a
public file for inspection any decision that results in information being
withheld. If the franchisee requests confidentiality and the request is denied
(i) where the franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the
proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be returned
to it; or (ii) the franchisee may seek review within five (5) working days of
the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
   (B)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the City Manager. The City Manager shall weigh the policy
considerations favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited for permitting
inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly
notify the requesting entity and the cable franchisee that submitted the
information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny, or
condition a request. The requesting party or the franchisee may seek review of
the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be
stayed pending resolution of any appeal.

ARTICLE III. BLIGHTED, DETERIORATED OR VACANT PROPERTIES
§ 71.200 FINDINGS
   (A)   The City Commission hereby finds that there exists with the city
numerous blighted, deteriorated or vacant properties and that the existence of
blighted and deteriorated properties within neighborhoods, and the growth and
spread of blight and deterioration or the threatened deterioration of other
neighborhoods and properties:
      (1)   Contribute substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease
and crime, and to losses by fire and accident;
      (2)   Necessitate expensive and disproportionate expenditures of public
funds for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire and accident
protection, and for other public services and facilities;
      (3)   Constitute an economic and social liability;
      (4)   Substantially impair or arrest the sound growth of the community;
      (5)   Retard the provision of decent, safe, and sanitary housing
accommodations;
      (6)   Depreciate assessable values;
      (7)   Cause an abnormal exodus of families from these neighborhoods; and
      (8)   Are detrimental to the health, the well-being, and the dignity of
many residents of these neighborhoods.
   (B)   The City Commission further finds that this menace cannot be
effectively dealt with by private enterprise without the aids provided herein
and that the benefits which would result from eliminating the blighted
properties that cause the blight and deterioration of neighborhoods will accrue
to the inhabitants of the neighborhoods in which these conditions exist and to
the inhabitants of the city generally.
   (C)   Therefore, the City Commission finds that there is a need in the city
for an exercise of the powers, functions and duties conferred by KRS 99.705-
99.730 and the city hereby adopts the provisions of KRS 99.705-99.730 and as
follows.

   (B)   The Review Commission shall certify, in a written report to the City

the following determinations have been made:
      (1)   That the owner of the property, as determined by reference to the
current tax assessment, roll in the office of the property valuation
administrator, or the owner's designated agent, has been notified through a
notice or order by the appropriate government agency to eliminate the
conditions which are in violation of local codes or law;

      (3)   That the property is, in fact, blighted or deteriorated;
      (4)   That the Review Commission has notified the property owner or the

expired and the property owner or agent has failed to comply with the notice;
      (5)   That the property owner has been afforded the opportunity to a
hearing before the Review Commission, with regard to the finding of blight, or
the valuation of the property if an offer to purchase has been made.
   (C)   Upon making a determination of blight or deterioration, the Review
Commission shall notify the owner of the property or the owner's designated
agent that a determination of blight or deterioration has been made and that

or deterioration and the process by which such a hearing must be requested.

shall commence upon the posting of the notice on the property. An extension of
the ninety (90)-day period may be granted by the Review Commission at the end
of such period if the owner or designated agent demonstrates that such period
is insufficient to correct the conditions cited in the notice.

owner elsewhere in this chapter.
   (B)   The owner of a property declared by the Review Commission to be
blighted or deteriorated shall have the right to a hearing before the Review

notify the Review Commission in writing, within twenty (20) days of the date of
the notice from the Review Commission. The request must state the name, address

thereof. The hearing shall be commenced within thirty (30) days after a request
has been filed. At such hearing, the appellant shall be given an opportunity to

filed.

recorded. Any person, upon request, may receive a copy of the recording,
provided, however, that the party making the request shall be responsible for
the cost of any transcript or copy.

will expedite the hearing without substantial prejudice to the interests of any
party, or if such practice is authorized by statute. Any party shall have the

relating to a hearing, either in person or through counsel. Copies of
documentary evidence may be obtained by parties upon the payment of a fee,
except where disclosure is protected by state or federal law.

noted in the record.

a court of the Commonwealth of Kentucky may take such notice.

constitute a serious and growing menace to the public health, safety and
welfare;
      (2)   That such property is likely to continue to deteriorate unless
corrected;
      (3)   That the continued deterioration of such property may contribute to
the blighting or deterioration of the area immediately surrounding the
property; and
      (4)   That the owner of such property has failed to correct the
deterioration of the property.
   (B)   The City Commission may acquire by eminent domain pursuant to KRS
Chapter 416, any property determined to be blighted or deteriorated pursuant to
this article, and shall have the power to hold, clear, manage, develop or
dispose of the property so acquired, for residential and related uses pursuant
to the provisions of this article and KRS Chapter 99.
(Ord. 2009-07, passed 6-23-09)
§ 71.213 ACQUISITION BY EMPLOYEES PROHIBITED; DISCLOSURE REQUIRED
   (A)   Pursuant to KRS 99.730, no member of the Review Commission or officer
or employee of the City Commission who in the course of his or her duties is
required in any way to participate in the determination of property blight or
deterioration or the issuance of notices of code violations which might lead to
a determination of blight or deterioration, shall acquire any interest in any
property which has been declared to be blighted or deteriorated by the Review
Commission.
   (B)   If any such member, officer or employee owns or has a financial

blighted or deteriorated by the Review Commission, he or she shall immediately
disclose, in writing, such interest to the Review Commission and to the City
Commission and such disclosure shall be entered in the minutes of the Review

domain proceedings or unless payment is unanimously approved by the Council.

ARTICLE II. PROCEDURE
Division 1. General Provisions
§ 72.100 INTRODUCTION
   The procedures hereinafter specified provide for a pre-application
procedure, for conditional approval of a preliminary plat, and for the approval
of a final plat. The pre-application procedure and the conditional approval of
the preliminary plat are optional to the applicant and are not a prerequisite
to the approval of the final plat. However, these optional procedures are
strongly recommended in that they provide the subdivider with an opportunity to
resolve problems early in the proceedings and to make necessary modifications
and revisions prior to incurring the expense of preparing a final plat.
(Ord. passed 11-14-72)
Division 2. Pre-Application Procedure
§ 72.125 PURPOSE
   (A)   The purpose of the pre-application procedure is to afford the
subdivider the opportunity to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the
Planning Commission and to consult early and informally before preparation of
the preliminary plat and before formal application for its approval.
   (B)   During the pre-application procedure, the subdivider can
advantageously make use of the services of the Planning Commission to help him
analyze the problems of the development and plan more adequately for its sound
coordination with the community. This preliminary discussion also affords the
Planning Commission the opportunity to give informal guidance to the
development at a stage when potential points of difference can be more easily
resolved. It can also simplify official actions and save unnecessary expense
and delay.

Division 4. Procedure for Approval of Final Plat
§ 72.175 APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT
   A plat of a subdivision with the jurisdiction of Bourbon County shall not be
recorded by the County Clerk unless and until it has first been approved by the
Planning Commission. The filing and recording of a plat involving the
subdivision of lands covered by this chapter shall be without legal effect
unless approved by the Planning Commission. Provided, however, that failure to
comply with this section shall not invalidate or affect the title to any land
within the area of the plat; and provided, further, that if the plat shall bear
the seal of the Planning Commission, it shall be presumed to have been approved
hereby.
   (A)   Application for final plat approval. A person desiring the approval of
a plat shall submit a written application for a certificate together with three
(3) copies of the proposed plat in the form prescribed in Article V to the
Planning Commission. Upon receipt of the application, the Planning Commission,
if it tentatively approves the application, shall set a date for a hearing,
notify the subdivider applicant in writing, and notify, by general publication
or otherwise, any person or governmental unit having a probable interest in the
proposed plat.
   (B)   General requirements prerequisite to approval of plat. In determining
whether an application for approval shall be granted, the Planning Commission
shall determine if the plat provides for:
      (1)   Coordination of subdivision streets with existing and planned
streets or highways;
      (2)   Coordination with an extension of facilities included in the
comprehensive plan;
      (3)   Establishment of minimum width, depth, and area of lots within the
projected subdivision;
      (4)   Distribution of population and traffic in a manner tending to
create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience, and the harmonious
development of the city or county; and
      (5)   Fair allocations of areas for streets, parks, schools, public and
semi-public buildings, homes, utilities, business, and industry. As a further
condition of approval of a plat, the Planning Commission shall specify:
      (6)   The manner in which streets shall be laid out, graded, and
improved;
      (7)   Provision for water, sewage, and other utility services;
      (8)   Provision for schools;
      (9)   Provision for essential municipal services; and
      (10)   Provision for recreational facilities.
   (C)   Improvements or guarantee thereof. Before approving any subdivision
plan for recording, the Planning Commission shall either require that all
facilities specified in Articles III and IV shall have been installed in strict
accordance with the standards and specifications of the Planning Commission, or
that the Planning Commission be assured by means of a proper contract and
completion guarantee, as set forth in subsections (D) and (E) below, that the
improvements will subsequently be installed by the subdivider.
   (D)   Agreement to complete improvements. In all cases where the necessary
grading, paving, and other street improvements required herein shall not have
been installed prior to final approval in strict accordance with the standards
and specifications of the Planning Commission, the applicant shall enter into a
written agreement with the city in the manner and form approved by the City
Attorney, wherein the applicant shall agree, to the extent applicable:
      (1)   To construct, or cause to be constructed, at his own expense, all
streets, bridges, culverts, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, crosswalks, water
systems, drainage facilities, street lighting facilities, street signs,
monuments, sanitary sewerage, street shade trees and parks, and all other
improvements shown on the subdivision plan, all in strict accordance with
standards and specifications of the Planning Commission or other appropriate
public authority and within the time specified in the agreement.
      (2)   To make adequate provision with the City Engineer for the
inspection of the construction of the aforesaid improvements to assure strict
compliance with the city standards and specifications.
      (3)   To maintain, at his own cost, the streets, bridges, culverts,
curbs, gutters, sidewalks, crosswalks, monuments, sanitary sewerage, street
shade trees, parks, and other improvements until the same are accepted or
condemned for public use by the city or other appropriate public authority, and
for a period of one (1) year thereafter to repair and reconstruct the same or
any part or one (1) of them when such repair or reconstruction shall be
specified by the Planning Commission as necessary by reason of faulty
construction, workmanship, or materials.
   (E)   Conditional approval of final plats. The Planning Commission may
approve a plat for a subdivision in which the improvements and installations
have not been completed by the applicant as required by this chapter, provided
that the subdivider enters into the agreement described and provides a bond
which shall:
      (1)   Run to Bourbon County;
      (2)   Be in an amount determined by the Planning Commission to be
sufficient to complete the improvements and installations in compliance with
this chapter; to reimburse the city for reasonable legal, engineering, and
inspection fees, and to obtain the easements required by
§ 72.204;
      (3)   Be with surety satisfactory to the Planning Commission; and
      (4)   Specify the time for the completion of the improvements and
installations.

   (B)   Where an approved sanitary sewer is accessible to the development, all
necessary mains and laterals for connection from the lots to the system, as
shown on the preliminary plat, shall be installed by the subdivider.
   (C)   If a sanitary sewage system is not accessible to the development, the
subdivider shall provide for sewage disposal on an individual lot basis
according to the rules, regulations, terms, definitions, and conditions set
forth by the Planning Commission.
   (D)   In all cases wherein trunkline sanitary sewer facilities are
available, the owner shall be required to install sanitary sewers and connect
the same to trunkline sewer, irrespective of the size of the lots included on
the subdivision plan.
   (E)   Soil percolation tests to determine the suitability of the soil for
on-lot sewage disposal facilities must be performed for all new subdivisions
where buildings are not to be connected to live public or community sanitary
sewers at the time of construction. The Planning Commission may waive this
requirement, in whole or in part, for subdivisions [in] which the individual
lots are to be two (2) acres or larger in area.
      (1)   The tests shall be supervised and certified by a registered
professional engineer. Where the approval of the County Department of Health is
required, a copy of their report of investigations, and approval of the
proposed sewage disposal system may be submitted in lieu of certification by an
engineer.
      (2)   The results of the tests shall be accompanied by a description of
sub-soil strata to a depth of four feet (4’) greater than the proposed effluent
disposal field or seepage pit. The data shall be obtained from test borings at
or near the site of each percolation test hole.
      (3)   Where possible, the tests shall be performed at or near the site of
the proposed sewage disposal facility for each lot according to the
specifications of the county health officer or as outlined in the manual of
septic tank practice, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
      (4)   The results of the tests shall be evaluated individually for each
lot in the light of information from test borings and topographic features at
each respective test hole location.
   (F)   (1)   All lots in any new subdivision that cannot be connected to a
live public or community sanitary sewer system at the time of building
construction shall be provided with an on-site sewage disposal system
consisting of a septic tank or tanks connected with one (1) or both of the
following:
         (a)   Tile disposal field. Wherever test results indicate that this is
a desirable system;
         (b)   Seepage pit (cesspool). Wherever test results indicate that this
is a desirable system.
       (2)   The design of proposed on-site sewage disposal facilities shall,
as a minimum requirement, meet the standards set up by the Department of Health
for the conditions found at each individual site.

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 74.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS Chapter 100
delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed
to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Commission hereby adopts the following floodplain
management chapter.
(Ord. 2010-9, passed 6-8-10)
§ 74.002 FINDINGS OF FACT
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2010-9, passed 6-8-10)
§ 74.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 2010-9, passed 6-8-10)
§ 74.004 OBJECTIVES
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2010-9, passed 6-8-10)
§ 74.005 DEFINITIONS
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   "A ZONE." Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   "ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE)." A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principle structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   "ACCESSORY USE." A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   "ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE)." Any walled and roofed expansion to

Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation
are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods,
while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to
all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood
damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property,
unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only
at very high flood insurance rates.

   "INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC)." Increased cost of compliance coverage
provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with state or
community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss
by flood. When a building covered by a standard flood insurance policy under
the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares the building to be
substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to thirty thousand
dollars ($30,000.00) for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove
the building.    ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.

supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filling of, or place a building, barrier, or
obstruction of any sort in, any area in the floodplain or floodway unless plans
and specifications for such work have been submitted to and approved by the
cabinet and a permit issued as required in subsection (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes. However, the cabinet may require
approval prior to construction of structures, dams, embankments, levees,
bridges, fill, or other construction related to agricultural operations that
impact the base flood of a stream.
      (4)   The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of

whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised);
      (2)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state
agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community
participating in the NFIP.
   "LIMITED STORAGE." An area used for storage and intended to be limited to

"FLOODWAY". The city, however allows no increase in the water surface elevation
throughout this area.
   "LOCAL FLOODWAY FRINGE." That same area as described in the definition of
"FLOODWAY FRINGE". For the city, encroachment may be permitted, but no increase
in the water surface elevation is allowed, and therefore a hydraulic and/or
hydrologic analysis is required.
   "LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE." The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support,
or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion

revision.)
   "MARKET VALUE." The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or
adjusted assessed values.
   "MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL)." The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on a community's FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988.
   "MITIGATION." Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of

inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e. mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is
in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   "MUDSLIDE (MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT." The operation of and overall program
of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e. mudflow)

on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1 - A30, or AR.
   "START OF CONSTRUCTION." (Includes substantial improvement and other
proposed new development.) The date a building permit is issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
placement or other improvement is within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure (including manufactured home) on a site, such as

§ 74.006 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES
   This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas (SFHA), areas
applicable to KRS 151.250 and, as determined by the Floodplain Administrator or
other delegated, designated, or qualified community official as determined by
the City Commission from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, areas within the jurisdiction of the
City Commission which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that
can adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of Paris.
(Ord. 2010-9, passed 6-8-10)
§ 74.007 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS AND CONSERVATION
DISTRICTS
   (A)   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) for Bourbon County
and incorporated areas, dated February 24, 2025, with the accompanying flood
insurance rate maps (FIRMs), other supporting data and any subsequent
amendments thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part
of these regulations by Paris, and for those land areas acquired by Paris
through annexation. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of
applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other
areas which allow implementation of this chapter, and which are recommended to
the City Commission by the Floodplain Administrator and are enacted by City
Commission pursuant to statutes governing land use management regulations. The
FIS and/or FIRM are permanent records of Paris and are on file and available
for review by the public during regular business hours at Paris City Hall at
525 High Street, Paris, Kentucky, 40361.
   (B)   There are areas in Bourbon County where detailed hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations may not have been performed. In these areas, a soils
floodplain may be used to establish approximate floodplain boundaries. The
soils floodplain consists of the alluvial soils listed below as defined by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service:
      (1)   Dunning Silty Clay Loam - Du;
      (2)   Lawrence Silt Loam - La;
      (3)   Lindside Silt Loam - Ln;
      (4)   Newark Silt Loam - Ne; and
      (5)   Nolin Silt Loam - No.
   (C)   Some soils floodplains exist along streams that have a FEMA floodplain
or post-development floodplain where detailed hydrologic and hydraulic
calculations have been performed. In this case, the FEMA floodplain and post-
development floodplain shall take precedence over the soils floodplain.
   (D)   Some soils floodplains exist along streams or low-lying areas that do
not have a FEMA floodplain or post-development floodplain and where detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic calculations have not been performed. In this case, a
structure can be constructed in the soils if:
      (1)   The property owner provides hydrologic and hydraulic calculations
from a professional engineer licensed in Kentucky, proving that the proposed
structure will not flood for the 100-year storm, will not create a drainage
problem.
      (2)   A foundation design, stamped by a professional engineer licensed in
Kentucky, is submitted as part of the applications for a building permit.

§ 74.013 ENFORCEMENT; VIOLATION NOTICE
   (A)   Civil offense.  If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See § 74.999.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven (7) days of the date the
citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven (7) days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.

granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions, and
is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2010-9, passed 6-8-10)
§ 74.101 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
74.201. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade;
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §
74.201 and
74.203; and
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, and A zones
where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
(Ord. 2010-9, passed 6-8-10)

   Penalty for violation, see §
74.999
§ 74.201 SPECIFIC STANDARDS
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
74.007, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower
than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation
perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with standards of subsection (C) below.
      (1)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated two (2) feet above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be produced.
Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060,
states as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit:
The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries
(and thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where
FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
(0.5) foot cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
      (2)   In all other zones, elevated two (2) feet above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with subsection (A) above or together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation two (2) feet above the level of
the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the level of the base
flood elevation;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
74.101;
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in subsection (D)
below;
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical
Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two (2) openings with a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area

special flood hazard established in §
74.007, are areas designated as floodways and floodway fringes, which have
determined base flood data. Since Paris currently has a number of existing
structures that are in close proximity to the base flood elevation, any
increase in said elevation could be extremely hazardous, therefore the
following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base

ARTICLE IV. APPEALS AND VARIANCES
§ 74.300 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding properly owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Commission to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The City Commission shall
establish an Appeal Board consisting of the Board of Adjustment.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local district court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Commission need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Commission
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under "PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE"), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection (D)(1)
through (11) above are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Paris Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition) upon determination that
the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   Dugouts.
      (1)   Variances may be issued for the construction of recreational
dugouts within the floodway fringe of an SFHA which is owned by the City of
Paris, Bourbon County, or any school Board of Education. Dugouts shall require
the approval and subsequent development permit by the Floodplain Administrator.
No hydraulic analysis is required to determine the new structure's impact on
the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge, as
long as all requirements listed below and any applicable provisions in §
74.204 are met. Dugouts are the only structures which have an exclusion from
said hydraulic analysis.
      (2)   Each dugout shall meet these following requirements in addition to
those in §
74.204:
         (a)   Three (3) walls maximum, with no enclosures.
         (b)   Maximum outside size dimensions - 30' x 10' x 8' (length x width
x height).
         (c)   Constructed on grade (min. 0.5%).
         (d)   Constructed so that the finished floor is at ground level (not
sunken).
   (I)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. 2010-9, passed 6-8-10)
§ 74.999 PENALTY
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more
than thirty (30) days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Additionally, the cause of the violation shall
be removed and the site shall be restored to pre-violation conditions. Any
expenses occurred, as a result of the violation removal, shall be paid for by
the violator. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain
Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent
or remedy any violation.

§ 75.002 RESPONSIBILITIES OF DEVELOPER
   (A)   The subdivider or developer shall provide effective sediment control
measures in the planning and development of land. Practical combinations of the
following technical principles shall be applied:
      (1)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one (1)
time during development;
      (2)   Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be used to protect critical
areas exposed during the development pursuant to
§ 75.004;
      (3)   Sediment control devices (debris basins, silt basins, or silt
traps, etc.) shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff
water from land under development;
      (4)   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed surface conditions during and after development;
      (5)   The development plan shall be fitted to the topography and soils so
as to create the least erosion potential; and
      (6)   Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained and
protected.
   (B)   Upon the removal from any land, the developer, as a minimum
requirement, shall reseed, resod, or revegetate the land. This shall be done
without four (4) months from the date of the removal or within thirty (30) days
of completion of excavation, filling, or grading, and in a manner commensurate
with the surrounding real estate, unless a permit is obtained from the City
Engineer or Planning Administrator. This does not apply to the agricultural or
horticultural use of real estate nor to vegetation removal in an area of less
than four thousand (4,000) square feet.

§ 75.003 MAINTENANCE BOND
   (A)   In cases where the Bourbon County Joint Planning Commission feels that
drainage, soil conditions, steep topography, amounts of cut and fill or type of
construction warrant, the Commission may require the posting of a maintenance
bond or similar guarantee to cover workmanship, facility installation, and
repair for a period of one (1) year after completion of the facility or after
final plat approval, whichever occurs latest.
   (B)   The Joint Planning Commission may consult with the City Engineer,
conservation district, or other qualified persons in seeking evidence to
warrant the requirement of the one (1) year maintenance bond. The maintenance
bond will commence on the date that the performance bond is released or
completion of development is certified by the developer to the Planning
Administrator or City Engineer. The Commission shall receive a favorable report
of inspection by the City Engineer or Planning Administrator prior to the
release of the one (1) year maintenance bond. The one (1) year maintenance bond
inspection will cover faulty construction or conditions caused by construction
of the development and necessary cleanup, not problems occurring from normal
usage.
(Ord. 16-82, § III, passed 8-10-82)
§ 75.004 PRELIMINARY SEEDBED PREPARATION
   (A)   Preliminary seedbed preparation is required to allow for optimum
establishment and development of seed. Preparation should include placement of
topsoil, disking, plowing, or harrowing in order to aerate and provide seed-
soil contact to minimize loss of seed.
   (B)   The following rates are minimum requirements to establish a good
cover. Other seeding mixtures and more extensive planting information is

to give protection to certain areas or individual structures and premises
designated as having substantial historic significance. This district and its
regulations are intended to protect against destruction, degradation, or
encroachment upon the areas, structures and premises designated to be of
substantial historic significance; to encourage uses which will lead to their
continuance, conservation and improvement in a manner appropriate to the
preservation of the historic heritage of the City of Paris, Bourbon County, and
the Commonwealth of Kentucky; to promote the economy by maintaining tourist
attractions; to prevent creation of environmental influences adverse to such
purposes; and to assure that new structures and uses within historic districts
will be in keeping with the character to be preserved and enhanced.
         (a)   Permitted uses and regulations. The Historic District
classification and regulations thereunder shall be established in addition to
the zone classification and regulations thereto as shown on the Zoning Map for
the subject areas. The use, dimension, area and other requirements for said
district as provided in the Paris Zoning Ordinance shall apply. Where there are
conflicts between the procedures and regulations herein established for
historic districts and other procedures and regulations in the Paris Zoning
Ordinance, it is intended that the provisions as set forth in this Historic
District shall apply.
         (b)   Location standards. An historic district is established within
the City of Paris from the north side of Fourth Street to the south side of
Second Street between the west side of Main Street and the east side of High

Section 8. (Historic District) hereinabove. Subsequent additional areas may be
added upon the recommendation of the Board of Architectural Review and the
Bourbon County Joint Planning Commission, accepted and approved by the Paris
City Commission.
         (c)   Board of Architectural Review. A Board of Architectural Review
shall be created.

for any membership vacancies occurring during said term. All members shall have
a known interest in historic district preservation.
            (2)   Powers and duties. The Board of Architectural Review shall
make recommendations to the Paris-Bourbon County Planning and Zoning Commission
and the City of Paris on all matters relating to the preservation,
conservation, and enhancement of structures, premises, and areas of substantial
historic or architectural significance and matters relating to establishment of
historic districts and regulations to be enforced thereunder. The Board of
Architectural Review shall inspect and designate such structures, premises and
areas in the City of Paris as it considers having substantial historic or
architectural significance.

be made by a majority vote of those members at any meeting where a quorum of
members is present. The Planning and Zoning Commission may provide a
secretarial staff and financial assistance to the Board of Architectural
Review.
         (d)   Procedure for establishment of historic district. The procedure
for the establishment of an Historic District shall be as follows:
            (1)   Application. An application for the establishment of an
historic district may be filed only by the Board of Architectural Review, the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the City of Paris, the owner of the subject
property, or by a person with written authorization of the owner. Said
application shall be filed with the Board of Architectural Review in such form
and accompanied by such information as required by the Zoning Ordinance and the
By-Laws of the Board of Architectural Review. Upon the filing of an application
by a governmental body, the Board of Architectural Review shall promptly notify
the owner by certified mail.
            (2)   Recommendation by Board of Architectural Review. Upon the
filing of an application for the establishment of an Historic District, the
Board of Architectural Review shall study and review the application. After
review, the Board shall forward the application and its recommendation to the
Planning Commission who shall give notice of the time, place and reason for
holding a public hearing thereon in the same manner as for zoning map
amendments. After notice of the public hearing and within sixty (60) days after
the filing date, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
proposed application and make a recommendation of approval or disapproval to
the City Commission. Upon approval by the City Commission, the Historic
District boundaries will be shown on the official zoning map.
         (e)   Certificate of Appropriateness required.  For purposes of this
section, an application for a demolition permit shall be deemed the same as an
application for a building permit and shall be subject to the same procedures.
The Building Inspector shall issue no building permits for the construction,
destruction, alteration, moving of any structure or premises, or, change in
exterior appearance the use of any structure or premises, and the Board of
Adjustment shall take no action resulting in the issuance of any building
permit or certificate of occupancy in an historic district except as expressly
authorized under Section (1) (Action by Board of Architectural Review)
hereinbelow and after the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness before a
building permit.
            (1)   Action by Board of Architectural Review. Upon the filing of
an application for a building permit, certificate of occupancy, or sign permit
in an historic district, the Building Inspector shall promptly notify the Board
of Architectural Review of such application. The Board shall meet within
fourteen (14) days after notification by the Building Inspector of the filing
of such applications. The Board, where it deems it necessary in order to review
a particular application, may require the submission of any or all of the
following items: architectural plans, plot plans, landscaping plans, plans for
off-street parking, proposed signs, elevations of all portions of proposed
structures facing streets, and elevation photographs or perspective drawings
showing proposed structures.
               In its review of material submitted, the Board of Architectural
Review shall examine the architectural design and the exterior surface,
treatment of the structures on the site in question, and their relationship to
other structures within the area, and other pertinent factors affecting the
appearance and efficient functioning of the historic district. The Board shall
vote to approve or disapprove the application within thirty (30) days after
notification by the Building Inspector of the filing of such application.
            (2)   Approval by Board of Architectural Review. If the Board of
Architectural Review approves the application for a building permit or an
occupancy permit in an Historic District, it shall promptly cause a Certificate
of Appropriateness to be issued to the applicant stating the matters which have
been approved, or, if applicable, that the building to be destroyed is
structurally unsound and beyond economic repair or of insufficient historic
significance. It shall at the same time transmit a copy of said certificate to
the Building Inspector. Upon receipt of the Certificate of Appropriateness, the
Building Inspector shall issue the building permit or Certificate of Occupancy
if it meets all other requirements of law. The Building Inspector shall inspect
the construction or alteration approved by such certificate from time to time
and shall promptly report to the Board of Architectural review any work not in
accordance with such certificate.
            (3)   Disapproval by Board of Architectural Review.  If the Board
of Architectural Review recommends disapproval of the application for a
building permit or an occupancy permit in an Historic District, it shall
promptly transmit a written report stating the reasons for such disapproval to
the Planning and Zoning Commission. In said written report the Board shall make
recommendations in regard to an appropriate architectural design, exterior
surface treatment, or other appropriate matters to make the application conform
to the intent of the Historic District regulations.
               In the event the Board of Architectural Review recommends
disapproval of the application for a Building Permit or an Occupancy Permit in
an Historic District, the applicant for said permit, within thirty (30) days
from the date of the Board’s action, may appeal to the Planning and Zoning
Commission, which shall hold a public hearing thereon and shall vote on said
appeal within sixty (60) days after the notice of appeal is filed with the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall give
notice of the time, place and reason for holding a public hearing in the same
manner as for zoning map amendments. If the Planning and Zoning Commission
votes to recommend that the application for a Building Permit or Certificate of
Occupancy permit be approved, it shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness
to the applicant and transmit a copy to the Building Inspector. If the
Commission votes to disapprove the application for a Building Permit or a
Certificate of Occupancy, it shall transmit its decision in writing to the
Building Inspector. In such cases, no Building Permit or Certificate of
Occupancy shall be issued by the Building Inspector on said application.
            (4)   Failure of Board of Architectural Review to act. Upon failure
of the Board of Architectural Review to take final action upon any case within
thirty (30) days after the application for a Building Permit or Certificate of
Occupancy has been filed with the Building Inspector, and unless a mutual
agreement between the Board of Architectural Review and the applicant has been
made for an extension of said time, the application shall be deemed to be
disapproved and the Planning and Zoning Commission shall act upon the
application as provided under Section (3) (Disapproval by Board of
Architectural Review) hereinabove.

         (d)   Protective maintenance. All buildings in the Historic District
shall be preserved against decay and deterioration in order to maintain
property values, prevent hazards to public safety and health, and rid
neighborhoods of negative visual appearances and unsafe conditions. Exterior
walls, roofs, foundations, doors and windows shall be maintained in a weather-
tight condition to prevent structural decay. Lack of maintenance that leads to
demolition by neglect shall be considered an exterior alteration requiring a
Certificate of Appropriateness from the Board of Architectural Review.
Demolition by neglect shall mean the process of allowing a building or
structure to deteriorate to the point that demolition is necessary to protect
public health and safety as defined by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation. Temporary boarding of openings, not to exceed thirty (30) days,
shall be permitted and does not require a Certificate of Appropriateness.
            (1)   Routine maintenance.  Ordinary maintenance or repair of any
historic property to correct deterioration, decay or damage does not require a
Certificate of Appropriateness if the work does not involve a change in design,
material or external appearance.
            (2)   Securing vacant property. All windows and doors shall be
maintained in a weather-tight condition. At a minimum, the following must be
done to secure vacant properties:
               i.   A dead-bolt lock or other locking device shall be installed
on the front exterior door above the existing lockset;
               ii.   Leaking roofs and box gutters shall be repaired so that
water cannot enter; and
               iii.   Exterior wall covering shall be such that weather cannot
penetrate.

hereinabove shall be reported to and enforced by the Building Inspector
pursuant to the provisions of the Kentucky Building Code as adopted by the City
at Section 70.001 of Title 7 of Chapter 70 of the Code of Ordinances herein.

      10.   NR - Neighborhood Revitalization Design Character Overlay Zone.
         (a)   Intent. In order to promote the economic and general welfare of
the people of the City of Paris and of the general public; and to ensure
complementary, orderly, and efficient redevelopment, the City of Paris has
determined that qualities relating to the visual characteristics that give a
distinct identity to an area and a harmonious appearance of structures that
stabilize an area, either residential, nonresidential or mixed us areas, may
require additional requirements to redevelop, maintain, protect, conserve or
preserve those qualities.
         (b)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this subsection 10 to permit the
City of Paris Board of Commissioners the opportunity to adopt additional
regulatory requirements in order to help conserve or promote certain visual
characteristics.
         (c)   Goals. The goal of this subsection 10 is to affect the purpose
and intent, as set forth in the above; and specifically, but not exclusively,
to:
            (1)   Give such designations and to enact such regulations as are
needed to protect against destruction, degradation, or encroachment upon
neighborhoods, areas or places having a special, unique or distinctive
character of aesthetic, architectural or cultural significance that serves as
the identity of either a residential neighborhood or a non-residential area.
            (2)   Encourage the use of existing buildings through adaptive
rehabilitation to enhance the diversity and interest of the city. Such
encouragement shall not imply a particular zoning designation.
            (3)   Encourage construction that will lead to continuation,
conservation and improvement in a manner appropriate to the scale and physical
character of the original buildings. Ensure that new construction is in harmony
with the scale and physical character of the original buildings of the
neighborhood through the use of design standards.
            (4)   Prevent the creation of environmental influences adverse to
such purposes.
            (5)   Foster civic pride in the value of accomplishments of the
past.
            (6)   Promote the educational, cultural, economic, and general
welfare of the people; or
            (7)   Create new character in an area that has been designated for
redevelopment.
         (d)   Regulations. The classifications and regulations hereunder shall
be established in addition to the overlay classification as shown on the Zoning
Map for the subject areas. The uses, dimensions and other requirements for said
zones, as provided in the Zoning Ordinance, shall apply, except where modified
as conditional zoning restrictions determined under these regulations. The
rezoning of an underlying zone does not automatically remove NR standards, and
the applicant would need to request that the overlay restrictions either be
removed or revised as conditions appropriate to the use. Where there are
conflicts between the procedures and regulations within the Zoning Ordinance,
the more restrictive shall apply.
         (e)   Overlay district designation criteria. An area, neighborhood or
place meeting one (1) or more of the following criteria may be eligible for
designation as a Neighborhood Revitalization Design Character Overlay (NR):
            (1)   It is an older area that, if placed under an NR
classification, may result in sufficient improvement to qualify as an H
Historic District in the future.
            (2)   It is a newer area that does not have historic significance.
In such case, if residential, the overall character of the surrounding
neighborhood(s) would be maintained, and if nonresidential, the overall
character would be determined by an urban or other design study that creates a
unified design;
            (3)   There is a need to protect the visual characteristics that
give a neighborhood or area its distinct identity;
            (4)   The existing neighborhood or area is characterized by a
variety of building types that establish a significant and distinguishable
identity;
            (5)   It has distinguishing characteristics of an architectural
style valuable for the study of a period, method of construction, or use of
indigenous materials;
            (6)   It has character as a geographically definable area
possessing a significant concentration of buildings or structures united by
past events or by its plan or physical development; or
            (7)   It has character as an established definable residential
neighborhood, agricultural area or business district, united by culture,
architectural style or physical plan and development.
         Nothing in this subsection 10 shall be construed to designate an NR
classification to regulate standards traditionally enforced through a deed
restriction, a restrictive covenant, private contractual right or term, or
regulations by any homeowner association, neighborhood association, or similar
association or entity.
      (f)   Designation of zones protected by Neighborhood Revitalization
Design Character Overlays. To further the goals and purposes of this subsection
10 and the preservation, protection, conservation and use of neighborhood
design character districts, the City of Paris Board of Commissioners shall have
the authority to designate zones protected by a Neighborhood Revitalization
Design Character Overlay, whether residential or nonresidential in nature.
      (g)   Procedure.  The procedure for the City of Paris Board of
Commissioners to initiate the designation of a Neighborhood Revitalization
Design Character Overlay District are as follows:   
         (1)   Design Standards Analysis. Any party advocating for the
designation of Neighborhood Revitalization Design Character Overlay District
shall prepare a design analysis of the proposed overlay district by one (1) of
the following methods, depending on whether the proposed neighborhood design
character zone is for a residential or a non-residential area:
            i.   For Residential
               1.   Establish a clear, decipherable set of neighborhood
features to describe the character of individual building types. This set shall
define the relationships among features and shall serve as a tool to identify
common elements in a neighborhood.
               2.   Identify and project future character, based on potential
change from present-day trends and regulations, relying on predominant existing
characteristics within the neighborhood; on characteristics that are seen as
desirable but not yet existing; or on a combination of the two (2).
               3.   Conduct architectural surveys to define present and/or
early character of the neighborhood. The requesting party shall conduct a field
survey containing, as a minimum, the following criteria: distinctive building
features; represented building styles; typical building components; finishing
materials; placement of building(s) on a site; landscape treatment; degree of
visual continuity; degree of density; and degree of compatibility of new
structures within historical context.
            ii.   For Nonresidential. Depending on the intent of the
Neighborhood Design Character Overlay, one (1) of the two (2) following methods
of design analysis shall be used by the requesting party:
               1.   Define New Character. Establish a clear, decipherable set
of standards that describe the desired character of the area. These criteria
shall define the relationships among existing and future features and shall
serve as a tool to identify common elements in a nonresidential area so as to
create a unified design.
               2.   Retain Existing Character.
                  a.   Conduct architectural surveys to define early and
present character of the area. The requesting party shall conduct a field
survey containing, as a minimum, the following criteria: distinctive building
features; represented building styles; typical building components; finishing
materials; placement of building(s) on the site; landscape treatment; degree of
visual continuity; degree of density; and degree of compatibility of new
structures within historical context.
                  b.   Develop preservation goals for the area and identify
important characteristics to be respected by comparing the degree of change
between early and present-day character.
                  c.   Identify and project future character as it relates to
potential change from present-day trends and regulations. Based on the present-
day scenario, identify if the area will preserve its integrity and meet its
design goals for the community.
      (h)   Design standards. The following criteria for new construction or
additions shall be based on the design standards analysis within each district.
The following are categories of design standards that shall be eligible for
overlay regulations and may modify existing zoning or as conditional zoning
restrictions. It is not required that each of the following be addressed;
instead, to utilize only those elements as applicable or desirable to conserve
the character of the neighborhood or surrounding area, and as determined in the
design standards analysis. All proposed standards should be specific and
measurable.
         (1)   Exterior building material restrictions.
         (2)   Roof lines and shape requirements.
         (3)   Repeating elements.
         (4)   Landscaping requirements.
         (5)   Minimum window and door opening requirements.
         (6)   Front building features.
         (7)   Garage door restrictions.
         (8)   Lot widths.
         (9)   Building orientation.
         (10)   Building heights.
         (11)   Building setbacks.
         (12)   Rear yard building setback.
         (13)   Accessory structures.
         (14)   Bulk plane restrictions.
         (15)   Off-street parking design.
         (16)   Floor area ratios.
         (17)   Signs.
      (i)   Proposal of new overlay district. A proposal for the establishment
of a Neighborhood Revitalization Design Character Overlay District may be
initiated only by the City of Paris Board of Commissioners who shall then refer
the matter to the Paris-Bourbon County Joint Planning Commission to analyze the
criteria within this subsection 10 as applied to any potential overlay zone.
The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City of Paris Board
of Commissioners within 180 days after receiving the request from the City of
Paris Board of Commissioners, which time may be extended for good cause by
subsequent act of the City of Paris Board of Commissioners. The recommendation
of the Planning Commission shall not be binding on the City of Paris Board of
Commissioners. Nothing in this subsection 10 shall be construed to prohibit any
person or entity from advocating to the City of Paris Board of Commissioners
about any overlay district. The City of Paris Board of Commissioners shall be
the sole decision-making body to create any Neighborhood Revitalization Design
Character Overlay District.
      (j)   Owner notification. When any proposal to establish a Neighborhood
Revitalization Design Character Overlay District is initiated, the Planning
Commission shall then hold at least one (1) public hearing, after notice, as
required by KRS Chapter 424 and KRS Chapter 100.
         (1)   Notice of the time, place and reason for the required public
hearing shall be given by one publication in the newspaper of general
circulation in the county, not earlier than twenty-one (21) days or later than
seven (7) days before the public hearing in accordance with KRS 100.211.
         (2)   Any published notice shall include boundary or the proposed
overlay district or a geographic description sufficient to locate and identify
the property, and the names of two (2) streets on either side of the property
which intersect the street on which the property is located; and when the
property in question is located at the intersection of two (2) streets, the
notice shall designate the intersection by name of both streets rather than
name two (2) streets on either side of the property.
         (3)   Written notice of the public hearing shall be given at least
thirty (30) days in advance of the hearing by first class mail to an owner of
every parcel of property the classification of which is proposed to be changed.
Records by the Property Valuation Administrator may be relied upon to determine
the identity and address of said owners. The notice shall state that the
subject property has been identified within the proposed overlay district; the
time, place and date of the hearing before the Planning Commission; and the
proposed specific design standards as determined desirable and recommended for
each proposed district.
         (4)   The Planning Commission staff, or other officer, of the Planning
Commission shall certify that the notice was mailed to an owner of every parcel
of property withing the proposed overlay district. Records maintained by the
Property Valuation Administrator may be relied upon conclusively to determine
the identity and address of said owners. In the event such property is in
condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, then the person notified by mail
shall be the president, or chairman, of the owner group which administers
property commonly owned by the condominium or cooperative owners. A joint
notice may be mailed to two (2) or more co-owners of an adjoining property who
are listed in the Property Valuation Administrator's records as having the same
address.
      (k)   Building permit review process. All building permit applications
will be required to comply with adopted design standards for applicable
building improvements on property located within a designated Neighborhood
Revitalization Design Character Overlay District and as approved by the
Planning Commission.

§ 80.204 MANUFACTURED HOMES
   A.   Definitions. See Section 80.008, Definitions, at the beginning of this
ordinance for definitions of 1) Manufactured Home, 2) Mobile Home, and 3)
Modular Home.
   B.   Temporary installation during construction. A manufactured home may
also be installed and temporarily occupied by the owner of a lot upon which a
permanent residence is under construction or under contract for construction,
or upon which the permanent residence has been damaged by fire or other
calamity so as to be temporarily uninhabitable, provided that:
      1.   Such manufactured home shall be installed either upon the same
property as the permanent residence or upon some other lot in the same
subdivision.
      2.   Such manufactured home shall be occupied for no longer than
necessary for the construction or repair of the permanent residence, but in any
case for no longer than is specified in the permit for such occupancy
hereinafter required.
      3.   Such manufactured home shall be connected with the public sewer.
      4.   Such manufactured home shall be so parked as to observe the setback
and yard requirements for an accessory building in the zoning district in which
it is located.
      5.   Such manufactured home shall be installed only after a written
permit is obtained from the city Building Inspector, and which shall specify
the date of termination. Such permit shall originally be for a period of six
(6) months or less. It may be extended one (1) time, for a period of not over
two (2) months by the Building Inspector upon a showing that circumstances
beyond the control of the occupant have delayed the construction or repair of
the main residence.
   C.   Manufactured homes permitted. Individual manufactured homes are
permitted in Residential District R-6 as single-family residences. Manufactured
home parks shall be permitted only as conditional uses approved by the Board of
Adjustment after referral and recommendations from the Planning Commission.
Manufactured home parks shall be permitted only in the R-6 Residential
District.
      1.   Area and density requirements. No manufactured home park shall be
permitted on an area of less than three (3) acres in size, although the
developer shall be permitted to develop the park in stages as long as he or she
complies with an overall plan approved the Planning Commission for the entire
tract. The number of manufactured homes permitted in the manufactured home park
shall not exceed a density of twelve (12) manufactured homes per net acre in
areas served by public sewer, or six (6) manufactured homes per acre in areas
not served by public sewer. A net acre shall be deemed to be the land to be
subdivided into lots after streets and other required improvements have been
installed.
      2.   Lot requirements. Individual lots within a manufactured home park
shall not be less than thirty-five hundred (3,500) square feet in area, and in
no instance shall more than one (1) manufactured home be permitted on a single
lot. The minimum lot width shall be fifty (50) feet.
      3.   Setback. No manufactured home or accessory building or structure
shall be located closer to any street than the minimum front yard setback for
permanent residential structures along said street. Where the manufactured home
park is not bounded by a dedicated street, the minimum setback shall be thirty
(30) feet.
      4.   Spacing. No manufactured home shall be located within thirty (30)
feet from another manufactured home, except that a minimum end-to-end clearance
of not less than twenty (20) feet shall be permitted.
      5.   Utilities. All lots within the manufactured home park shall be
provided with sewer, water, and electrical facilities meeting the standards
specified by local and state building and health regulations, and each
manufactured home shall be properly connected with said utilities.

patios, shall be located within five (5) feet from any individual lot line.
      7.   Procedure for establishing manufactured home park.  In that
manufactured home parks are permitted as conditional uses only, the prospective
developer, before attempting to obtain a building permit or beginning any
construction, shall prepare a plan showing the lot dimensions and bearings of
the parcel he or she intends to develop, its location within the city, general
layout or design he or she intends to follow and improvements he or she expects
to make on the land. He or she shall then meet with the Planning Commission,
the purpose being to inform the developer of any plans that would affect his or
her development and to allow the Planning Commission to review the plan to
insure that the developer's plan are not in conflict with any of the
Commission's plans. This meeting would also form a common ground whereby the
Planning Commission and the prospective developer could reach an understanding
of the types of improvements necessary. In making recommendations on the
development plan, the Planning Commission may recommend certain conditional
requirements pertaining to such things as landscaping, screening, and road
requirements. After recommendations from the Planning Commission, the
prospective developer shall meet with the Board of Adjustment and request the
necessary permission before a building permit can be issued. Any condition
requirements established by the Board of Adjustment shall be considered as a
part of the official zoning regulations and failure to comply therewith shall
be subject to the penalties contained herein.
      8.   Pre-owned manufactured homes. Pre-owned manufactured homes,
purchased outside Kentucky, must meet the requirements of KRS 227.600, and have

manufactured homes located outside an R-6 (Manufactured Homes) District as of
this date of this ordinance shall be allowed to remain in their present
location as a legal non-conforming use. No additional manufactured home shall
be permitted on a permanent basis within the city except those located within
an approved manufactured home park. Existing manufactured homes that are non-
conforming uses may be replaced by a new manufactured homes, equivalent in
size.
   E.   Modular homes. Modular homes, which have been approved by the Kentucky
Division of Codes Enforcement, may be installed in any residential zoning
district in accordance with the applicable building codes and zoning criteria
of subject district.
(Am. Ord. 2014-12, passed 7-15-14)
§ 80.205 JUNKYARDS
   A.   Junkyards are not designated as permitted uses in any district and are
consequently non-conforming uses in all districts. They shall conform with
Section
80.206 of this ordinance prescribing regulations for non-conforming uses. The
enforcement officer shall ensure that all existing junkyards maintain valid
permits to operate issued by the Kentucky Department of Highways, as required
by KRS 177.905 thorough 177.990, and he or she shall ensure that all screening
required by the Department of Highways is maintained as long as the junkyards
remain in operation.
(Am. Ord. 2014-12, passed 7-15-14)
§ 80.206 NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
   A.   Non-conforming uses. A non-conforming use shall be permitted to
continue as long as it remains otherwise lawful, and shall be regulated as
follows:
      1.   A non-conforming use shall not be extended, or expanded, beyond the
scope and area of it's operation at the time of the adoption of the regulation
which makes such use non-conforming.
      2.   When a non-conforming use of any structure, or premises, has been
discontinued for a period of one (1) year or more, showing a gross lack of
diligence in use, except when government action or structural damage prevents
such use, the non-conforming use shall not be re-established, and said
structure and/or premises must thereafter be used in conformance with this
ordinance.
      3.   A non-conforming use may not be changed to any other non-conforming
use except that, with the written approval of the Board of Adjustment, a non-
conforming use may be changed to another non-conforming use of the same, or a
more restrictive, classification. If the BOA approves a change in use, no
structural changes may be made to the exterior of the building.
   B.   Non-conforming structures. A non-conforming structure shall be
permitted to continue as long as it remains otherwise lawful, and shall be
regulated as follows:
      1.   A non-conforming structure shall not be enlarged, replaced or
structurally altered in any way that increases its non-conformity, but a
structure may be altered to decrease its non-conformity. However, it may be
restored to a safe condition if declared unsafe by the enforcement officer or
other public official with jurisdiction.
      2.   Should a non-conforming structure, or portion of a structure, be
damaged, destroyed or demolished by any means, it may be reconstructed or
repaired, and the non-conforming use resumed; but it may not exceed the number
of square feet of floor area nor the number of cubic feet it contained prior to
its damage, destruction or demolition.
   C.   Non-conforming lots.  In any case where an official lot of record at
the date of the adoption, or amendment, of this ordinance, does not conform to
the width, depth or area requirements of this ordinance, it shall be considered
a legal non-conforming lot and be permitted to continue, and shall be regulated
as follows:
      1.   A non-conforming lot may not be further subdivided or consolidated
with another parcel in a manner that increases its non-conformity, but may be
altered so as to decrease its non-conformity. However, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may approve the subdivision of a lot, which has two (2) or more
legally constructed principal residences, into separate parcels for the purpose
of the sale or transfer of the individual residences. This may be done only if
the Commission finds that the properties have been used in a separate and
distinct manner with separate utilities, and other facilities, so that the
resulting subdivision will not constitute a material change in the use of the
property.
      2.   A residential dwelling may be built upon a lot (including a lot of
record) which was non-conforming at the time this ordinance was adopted. The
Board of Adjustments shall permit variances, within reasonable conformity with
existing structures in the area, and as described in Section 80.301.B.3
(Dimensional variance) of this ordinance.

   I.   General.
      1.   A cellular antenna tower for cellular telecommunications services of
personal communications services may be allowed:
         (a)   In any (A-1) Agricultural, (B) Business, or (I) Industrial
District, except those with the districts containing the Central Business
District, historic properties, or scenic highways;
         (b)   After a review by the Planning Commission, in accordance with
the adopted goals and objectives of the Paris-Bourbon County Comprehensive
Plan, the regulations contained within the City of Paris Zoning Ordinance, and
these Cellular Antenna Tower Regulations;
      2.   Location of a cellular tower in an (R) Residential District, and
historic property, the Central Business District, or near scenic highways is
discouraged, and the placement of a cellular tower in any of these areas should
be avoided.
      3.   Co-location of service facilities is preferred. Co-location
objectives may be satisfied by configuration of new facilities for multiple
carriers or by co-location on existing facilities. Any request for review of a
proposal to construct such an antenna tower or to reconfigure, enlarge or
reconstruct an existing antenna tower, shall be made only in accordance with
these regulations.
      4.   However, if the property is subject to an existing Conditional Use
Permit, the property owner shall obtain approval of the appropriate
modification request. Such request shall be filed simultaneously with the
uniform application. Review of the Conditional Use Permit plan shall be limited
to a determination of the impact of the antenna tower for cellular
telecommunications services or personal communications services construction on
the requirements of the Conditional Use Permit. The property owner shall be
responsible for making alternative provision for any alteration of Conditional
Use Permit or shall obtain a variance or waiver of the Permit requirement
affected by the location of the tower on the site.
   J.   Processing of application.
      1.   Applications for the construction of cellular antenna towers for
cellular telecommunications services or personal communications services shall
be processed as follows:
         (a)   At least one (1) public hearing on the proposal shall be held,
at which hearing interested parties and citizens shall have the opportunity to
be heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at
least once, in a newspaper of general circulation in Bourbon County, provided
that one (1) publication occurs not less than seven (7) calendar days or more
than twenty-one (21) calendar days before the occurrence of such hearing.
         (b)   Notice of the proposal shall be posted on the site at least
fourteen (14) days in advance of the hearing. Such notice shall consist of a
written notice, of durable material at least two (2) feet by four (4) feet in
size, stating that "[Name of applicant] proposes to construct a
telecommunications tower on this site" and including the addresses and
telephone numbers of the applicant and the Planning Commission. Notice of the
proposal shall also be posted on the public road nearest the site. Such notice
shall consist of a written notice, of durable material at least two (2) feet by
four (4) feet in size, stating that "[Name of applicant] proposes to construct
a telecommunications tower near this site" and including the addresses and
telephone numbers of the applicant and the Planning Commission.
         (c)   Notice of the hearing shall be given at least fourteen (14) days
in advance of the hearing, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
owner of every parcel of property within five hundred (500) feet of the
proposed tower or property contiguous to the site upon which the tower is
proposed to be constructed. Said notice shall include a map of the location of
the proposed construction, the telephone number and address of the Planning
Commission, and shall inform the addressee of his or her right to participate
in the Planning Commission's proceedings on the applications. Records
maintained by the Property Valuation Administrator may be relied upon
conclusively to determine the identity and address of said owner. In the event
such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, then the
person notified by mail shall be the president or chairperson of the owner
group which administer property commonly owned by the condominium or
cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two or more co-owners of an
adjoining property who are listed in the Property Valuations Administrator's
records as having the same address.
         (d)   Upon holding such hearing, the Planning Commission shall, within
sixty (60) days commencing from the date that the application is received by
the Planning Commission, or within a date specified in a written agreement
between the Planning Commission and the applicant, make its final decision to
approve or disapprove the uniform application. If the Planning Commission fails
to issue a final decision within sixty (60) days, and there is no written
agreement between the Planning Commission and the utility to a specific date
for the Planning Commission to issue a decision, it shall be presumed that the
Planning Commission has approved the utility's uniform application.
         (e)   The Planning Commission Technical Review Committee will review
the application, then forward their comments to the Commission. The evaluation
will be based on the following criteria:
            (1)   The Planning Commission will deny a uniform application to
construct a cellular antenna tower based on an applicant's unwillingness to
attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or related equipment on any new
existing towers.
            (2)   Agreement with the various elements of the Paris-Bourbon
County Comprehensive Plan, and where applicable, any other adopted plans.
            (3)   Extent to which the proposal is consistent with the purposes
of these regulations.

the sufficiency of the site to comply with the established Design Standards
listed in Section L. (Design standards) below, of these regulations.
            (5)   Extent to which the proposal responds to the impact of the
proposed development on adjacent land uses, especially in terms of visual
impact.
            (6)   Extent to which the proposed facility is integrated with
existing structures, or the extent to which the proposed cellular antenna tower
uses stealth technology.
         (f)   Upon approval of a cell tower application, a building permit
must be obtained within five (5) years of Planning Commission approval of the
site plan. From issuance of the building permit no more than two (2) extensions
may be obtained. Otherwise, the plan shall be deemed as disapproved by the
Commission and the applicant must reapply.
   K.   Amendments.
      1.   Any amendments to the site development plans, except for minor
adjustments as determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, shall be made in accordance with the procedure required in

Planning Commission the names and addresses of the owners of all adjoining
property. Records maintained by the Property Valuation Administrator may be
relied upon conclusively to determine the identity and address of said owners.
In the event such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership,
then the person notified by mail shall be the president, or chairman, of the
owner group which administers property commonly owned by the condominium or
cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two (2) or more co-owners
of an adjoining property who are listed in the Property Valuation
Administrator's records as having the same address.

(60) days of the date of its receipt of the proposed amendment.
   B.   The Planning Commission shall make findings of fact and a

in the absence of such a finding that:
      1.   The original zoning classification given to the property was
inappropriate or improper, and that the proposed classification is proper; or
      2.   That there have been major changes of an economic, physical or
social nature within the area involved which were not anticipated in the
Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Planning Commission and which have
substantially altered the basic character of the area.
   C.   The Planning Commission shall also determine, as part of its findings,
the suitability and compatibility of any proposed development of said property.
   D.   The Planning Commission shall have the power to hear and finally decide
applications for variances or conditional use permits in conjunction with a

(5)). Recommendations regarding these permits shall be a part of the record
forwarded to the City Commission.
   E.   The findings of fact and recommendation shall include a summary of the

Pursuant to KRS 100.211(2), it shall take a majority of the entire City
Commission to override the recommendation of the Planning Commission, and it
shall take a majority of the entire City Commission to adopt a zoning map and
text amendment whenever the Planning Commission forwards the application to the
City Commission without a recommendation of approval or disapproval due to a
tie vote. Unless a majority of the entire City Commission votes to override the
Planning Commission's recommendation, such recommendation shall become final
and effective. If a recommendation of approval was made by the Planning
Commission, the ordinance of the City Commission adopting the zoning map
amendment shall be deemed to have passed by operation of law.
   B.   The City Commission shall take final action upon a proposed zoning map
or text amendment within ninety (90) days of the date upon which the Planning
Commission takes its final action on such proposal. The City Commission shall

its normally scheduled meeting time. The Planning Commission will act for
approval, conditional approval (with conditions noted), postponement or
disapproval. The Planning Commission delegates approval for all development
plans in I-1 and I-2 districts to the Technical Review Committee. The
Commission may modify or disapprove the development plan if it finds the plan
does not comply with the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, or when
applicable, the Subdivision Regulations. It may also modify or disapprove the
plan if it finds there are existing or potentially substantial conditions such
as flooding, poor drainage, traffic, topographic or similar problems with the
suitability or compatibility of the development of the subject property.

   A.   A preliminary development plan is less specific or detailed than a
final development plan in terms of the exact arrangement of building, parking
areas, open spaces, access points and other site design features. At this
stage, the Planning Commission may consider many major aspects of the
development without an undue amount of final design work on the part of the
developer. A preliminary development plan that is submitted with a request for
a zoning map amendment may be used for the Planning Commission's recommendation
to the City Commission.
   B.   When a preliminary development plan is approved by the Planning
Commission, then it shall be required that a final development plan be
submitted to the Planning Commission within two (2) years of the approval of
the preliminary development plan. Otherwise, the preliminary development plan
shall be deemed as disapproved with the major aspects of the approved
preliminary plan, as determined by the Planning Commission. A copy of the
approved preliminary plan shall accompany the submittal of the more detailed,
final development plan.

§ 81.201 VARIANCES
   In such individual situations where, by reason of exceptional topographic,
dimensional, or shape, or other special conditions of the site, the enforcement
of this chapter would create an undue hardship on the applicant, that applicant
may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals for relief from specific provisions.
In granting such variances, the Board of Adjustment shall make supporting
findings, including the following:
   (A)   The specific conditions and detail which are unique to the applicant’s
land and do not exist on other land within the same zone.
   (B)   The manner in which the strict application of the provisions of this
chapter would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land in a manner
equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone.
   (C)   That any unique conditions and circumstances are not the result of
actions of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this chapter.
   (D)   Reasons that the variance will preserve, not harm, the public safety
and welfare, and will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood.
(Ord. passed 1-9-73; Am. Ord. passed 7-20-76, § 6)
§ 81.202 APPROVAL OF PLAT SUBJECT TO LANDSCAPE PLAN
   (A)   No final approval shall be given by the Planning Commission to any

landscape contractor, with the bond amount to include the accurate cost plus no
more than twenty-five percent (25%) and the bond to be release upon
satisfactory completion of the work as determined by the body approving the
plan. The bond shall run to the Planning Commission and to the city where the
area involved is located, or, if outside the city, to Bourbon County.
   (B)   Waiver of plan and issuance of building permit. The Planning
Commission, in its discretion, may waive the requirement that a landscape plan
be presented and approved before final plat approval; provided, however, that
in all instances where landscaping is required by this chapter, no building
permit shall be issued until the required landscaping plan has been submitted
and approved and the bond required by subsection (A) posted; and, no occupancy
permit or certificate of zoning compliance shall be issued until the
landscaping is completed, as certified by an on-site inspection by the
