FUND BALANCE/RESERVE POLICY
§ 30.10 FUND BALANCE/RESERVE POLICY.
   (A)   Fund classifications. The fund balance has five classifications: Non-
spendable, Restricted, Committed, Assigned and Unassigned.
      (1)   Non spendable fund balance. This classification includes amounts
that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in a spendable form —
long-term receivables and prepaid items; or (b) legally or contractually
required to be maintained intact.
      (2)   Restricted fund balance. This classification reflects the
constraints imposed on resources either (a) externally by creditors, grantors,
contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments; or (b) imposed by
law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.
      (3)   Committed fund balance. These amounts can only be used for specific
purposes to constraints imposed by formal ordinances of the City Council (the
government’s highest level of decision-making authority). Those committed
amounts cannot be used for any other purposes unless the City Council removes
the specified use by taking the same type of action imposing the commitment.
This classification also includes contractual obligations to the extent that
existing resources in the fund have been specifically committed for use in
satisfying those contractual requirements.
      (4)   Assigned fund balance. This classification reflects the amounts
constrained by the city’s “intent” to be used for specific purposes but are
neither restricted nor committed. The City Council and City Administrator have
the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes. Assigned fund
balances include all remaining amounts (except negative balances) that are
reported in governmental funds, other than the General Fund, that are not
classified as non-spendable and are neither committed.

classification for the General Fund. It is also used to report negative fund
balances in other governmental funds.
   (B)   Order of use of fund classification. When both restricted and
unrestricted resources are available for use, the city shall use externally
restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources committed, assigned and
unassigned in order as needed.

aside or constrain funds for a specific purpose. Any funds set aside as
committed funds, beyond the already constrained funds outlined in division (D)

transfers for emergency “rainy day” purposes.
      (2)   Resilience (Stabilization) Fund balance.
         (a)   Maintaining a financial Resilience Fund balance within the
General Fund is a necessity for sound financial management and fiscal
accountability. The Resilience Fund balance shall not be used to fund operating
or regular capital expenditures that should otherwise be funded with operating
revenues and reserves.
         (b)   The Resilience Fund has been established by the city for the
purpose of providing funds for an urgent event that affects the safety of the
public (e.g., declaration of economic emergency, or other specific
circumstances such as slow economic growth or a natural disaster, such as
flood, tornado, and the like) for unexpected revenue declines that are
projected to continue for more than two years.
         (c)   The minimum level of the Resilience Fund balance is $5,000,000
of the most current fiscal year expenditures. The Resilience Fund balance is
accounted for as committed funds on the city’s audited financial statements.
This policy shall become effective for the June 30, 2023, audited financial
statements.

Resilience Fund balance shall be included in the budget presented by the Mayor

submitted with a plan to restore the minimum resilience fund within two years.
      (3)   Employee Internal Service Fund. This Fund is designed to cover the
premiums and claims related to the city’s self-funded plan to provide employees
with medical and dental insurance. Reserves shall be maintained between
$100,000 and $250,000 to allow for emergencies and numerous or large claims.
      (4)   Capital Asset Fund. This Fund is used to replace large equipment,
vehicles, and infrastructure projects. The minimum level of the Capital Asset
Fund balance is a minimum balance of $250,000.
      (5)   Police Forfeiture Fund. This Fund is a special revenue fund,
derived from drug forfeitures that must be expended for police equipment and
supplies. These funds can be spent to a zero balance annually. The fund balance
should never be less than the total of funds collected, but not yet spent, that
are restricted to a specific purpose.
      (6)   Park Improvement Fund. This Fund is a special revenue fund, derived
from a percentage of real estate taxes and general fund transfers made
periodically. The Park Improvement Fund was established for the ongoing
development of new and existing parks and Park Master Plan. All unspent real
estate taxes are classified as restricted funds. All unspent General Fund
transfers that are committed by contract or budget ordinance are classified as
committed funds. All remaining funds are classified as assigned funds for
future park expenditures. These funds can be spent to a zero balance annually.
      (7)   TIF Fund. This Fund is a special revenue fund, derived from
“incremental occupational revenues” associated with the development district
also known as Erlanger Road Commerce Center. These funds can be spent to a zero
balance annually.

TERMINATION OF CITY EMPLOYEES AND NON-ELECTED CITY OFFICERS
§ 35.100 TERMINATION OF CITY EMPLOYEES AND NON-ELECTED CITY OFFICERS OTHER THAN
MEMBERS OF POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      CITY. The City of Erlanger.
      CITY COUNCIL. The Erlanger City Council
      COLLABORATIVE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE. Progressive discipline that has
involved not only the employee and the direct supervisor thereof; but also the
head of the department and the City Administrative Officer. COLLABORATIVE
PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE shall apply solely to job performance and not an
egregious act or omission as defined herein.
      DUE PROCESS EVIDENTIARY HEARING. A hearing that conforms to the due
process provisions of the federal and state constitutions, including, but not
limited to, the right to a hearing, the right to counsel, the right to examine
and cross-examine all witnesses and/or evidence presented against the employee
and the right to written findings of fact.
      EGREGIOUS ACT OR OMISSION. Any act or omission resulting in the death or
serious physical injury of another person, or damage to the property of another
person causing a pecuniary loss of $500 or more; violation of a city policy or
procedure; being convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving fraud/
dishonesty; being convicted of an misdemeanor and/or other traffic offense, for
which an employee’s driver’s license is suspended and a valid driver’s license
is a job requirement.
      EMPLOYEE. A full-time non-probationary employee of the city, including,
without limitation, nonelected officers of the city; but excluding members of
the Police or Fire Departments of the city.
      FELONY. Has the same meaning provided for that word in KRS 500.080(5).
      INADEQUATE JOB PERFORMANCE. A failure to adequately and efficiently
engage in and perform the specifications, duties, functions and tasks of a
position of employment.
      MAYOR. The duly elected and qualified Mayor of the city and any
subordinate officer or employee to whom the authority of the Mayor has been
delegated by executive order pursuant to KRS 83A.139(7).
      MISDEMEANOR. Has the same meaning provided for that word in KRS 500.080
(13).
      PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE.
         (a)   A process for dealing with inadequate or other job performance
issues by an employee that does not meet the standards of the city that have
been communicated to the employee. The primary purpose of PROGRESSIVE
DISCIPLINE is to assist the employee to understand that a performance problem
exists. The process features increasingly formal efforts to provide feedback to
the employee so the employee can correct the problem. The goal of PROGRESSIVE
DISCIPLINE is to improve employee performance. The process of PROGRESSIVE
DISCIPLINE is not intended as a punishment to an employee; but as assistance to
the employee to overcome performance problems and satisfy job expectations.
PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE is most successful when it assists an employee to become
an effectively performing member of the organization. Failing that, PROGRESSIVE
DISCIPLINE enables the city to fairly and with substantial documentation
terminate the employment of employees who are ineffective and unwilling or
unable to improve.
         (b)   Without limitation, the progress of PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE may
begin with verbal counseling about:
            1.   The requirements of the job;
            2.   Performance expected by the employer;
            3.   The employee’s understanding of the requirements of the job
and the performance expected by the employer: and
            4.   The failure of the performance of the employee to meet the
employer’s expectations; and then proceed from verbal counseling to a verbal
reprimand that the job performance of the employee has continued to be
inadequate; and then proceed from a verbal reprimand to a written verbal
warning to the employee that the job performance of the employee has continued
to be inadequate and that the continued failure of the performance of the
employee to meet the employer’s expectations may result in suspensions from
work, without pay and ultimately termination of employment; and then proceed
from a verbal written warning to suspension without pay; and, finally, from
suspensions without pay to termination of employment.
      SUSPENSION WITH OR WITHOUT PAY. An employee may be subject to suspension,
with or without pay, in the event of suspension without pay, due process shall
be afforded.
   (B)   Employee discipline and punishment. An employee of the city may only
be disciplined, terminated from employment or otherwise punished by the Mayor;
for inadequate job performance or an egregious act or omission; and only
pursuant to the procedures described herein.
      (1)   An employee of the city shall not be terminated from employment or
otherwise disciplined or punished by the Mayor for inadequate job performance
unless the personnel file of that employee includes documentation of
collaborative progressive discipline in regard to that inadequate job
performance.
      (2)   An employee of the city may be terminated or otherwise disciplined
or punished by the Mayor for an egregious act or omission, without any
documentation in the personnel file of an employee for any collaborative
progressive discipline or without any other limitation.
      (3)   In the event of reasonable cause to believe that an employee of the
city has engaged in any act or omission constituting inadequate job performance
or an egregious act or omission, that employee may be subject to either
suspension without pay and/or termination by the Mayor; but only after a due
process evidentiary hearing in regard to the existence of such reasonable
cause; and, when the Mayor is considering the suspension without pay and/or
removal of an employee, that consideration shall be reported to the employee.
The notice of charge shall include direction to the employee that they may
request a due process hearing by providing written notice to the City Clerk
within ten days. In the event that the employee does not seek to appeal within
ten days, including weekends, the employee shall be deemed to have waived any
due process rights and the suspension without pay and/or termination shall be
final.
         (a)   If the employee timely requests a due process appeal, the
Hearing Officer shall provide written notice of the time, place and date of the
due process evidentiary hearing to the employee, with a copy to the Mayor and
City Administrative Officer. The due process evidentiary hearing in regard to
proposed suspension without pay and/or termination shall be conducted by a
designee of the City Attorney, called the “Hearing Officer,” who shall be a
member of the Local Government Section of the Northern Kentucky Bar
Association, or any other attorney at law with experience in municipal law, any
retired judge or any other attorney at law who has experience in conducting due
process employment hearings. The hearing shall be conducted to insure due
process is provided to the employee. The Hearing Officer shall be compensated
on an hourly basis in the amount of $150 per hour.
         (b)   Within 30 days after the conclusion of the due process
evidentiary hearing, the Hearing Officer shall prepare a written report and
recommendation, with factual determinations to which the decision of the Mayor
shall be limited. The Hearing Officer shall provide the employee and the Mayor
and each member of the City Council through the City Clerk with the written
report and recommendations, including all factual determinations in support of
the recommendations and conclusions resulting from the due process hearing.
         (c)   The employee may not be terminated from employment by the Mayor
without written conclusions by the Hearing Officer that the job performance of
the employee was inadequate, or the employee engaged in an egregious act or
omission.

writing to the employer that the proposed new or expanded eligible business
activities qualify for the EDGE incentive established in this chapter. The
Economic Development Director shall look at the provisions of (C)(1), (C)(2)
and (C)(3) above and shall consider all other incentives previously or
currently offered to the employer prior to approving the application.
   (E)   In determining of the amount of incentive offered to each applicant,

§ 37.06 TERMINATION OF EDGE INCENTIVE.
   Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, in any annual period of

the person’s usual place of residence with any individual residing therein who
is 18 years of age or older and who is informed of the contents of the notice.
   (C)   (1)   Any person requesting a hearing who fails to appear at the time
and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have waived the right to a
hearing to contest the citation, and the determination that a violation was
committed shall be final. In this event, the citation as issued shall be deemed
a final order determining the violation was committed and imposing the civil
fine set forth in the citation, and the alleged violator shall be deemed to
have waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court.
      (2)   Notice of a final order shall be provided to the cited violator by
regular first-class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; personal
delivery; or by leaving the notice at the person’s usual place of residence
with any individual residing therein who is 18 years of age or older and who is
informed of the contents of the notice.
   (D)   All testimony at the hearing shall be taken under oath and recorded.
Testimony shall be taken from the Code Enforcement Officer, the alleged
violator, and any witnesses to the violation offered by the Code Enforcement
Officer or alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but
fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings.
   (E)   The Code Enforcement Board shall, based on the evidence, determine
whether a violation was committed. If it is determined that no violation was
committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered. If it is
determined that a violation was committed, an order may be issued upholding the
citation. The Board may impose a fine up to the maximum authorized by
ordinance, or require the offender to remedy a continuing violation to avoid a
fine, or both.
   (F)   (1)   Every final order following a hearing shall be reduced to
writing, which shall include the findings and conclusions reached and the date
the order was issued. A copy shall be furnished to the person named in the
citation.
      (2)   If the person named in the citation is not present when the final
order is issued, the order shall be delivered to the person by regular first-
class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; personal delivery; or by
leaving the notice at the person’s usual place of residence with any individual
residing therein who is 18 years of age or older and who is informed of the
contents of the notice.

selected by the city, a Code Enforcement Officer for the city, or by a member
of the city’s administrative staff.
(Ord. 2560, passed 6-6-2023)
§ 44.10 APPEALS; FINAL JUDGMENT.
   (A)   An appeal from a final order of the Code Enforcement Board following a
hearing conducted pursuant to §
44.08(E) may be made to the Kenton County District Court within 30 days of the
date the order is issued. The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a
complaint and a copy of the final order in the same manner as any civil action
under the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (B)   If no appeal from a final order of the Code Enforcement Board is filed
within the time period set in division (A) above, the Code Enforcement Board’s
order shall be deemed final for all purposes.
(Ord. 2560, passed 6-6-2023)
§ 44.11 ORDINANCE FINE SCHEDULE.
   Violations of ordinances that are enforced by the Kenton County Joint Code
Enforcement Board shall be subject to the schedule of civil fines as set forth
by separate ordinance.
(Ord. 2560, passed 6-6-2023)
§ 44.12 LIEN; FINES, CHARGES, AND FEES.
   (A)   Complaints of violations of this chapter are generally received from
the public, city staff, or observed by city Citation Officers. When a complaint
is received, a Citation Officer is assigned the complaint. The Citation Officer
shall document the complaint and determine if it is valid or unfounded. If
found to be valid, the resident is notified of the violation through a warning
or citation. A hearing disputing the warning/citation may be requested at this
time. If a hearing is not requested, the Citation Officer will reinspect the
violation in seven days. If the violation has been corrected and the property
owner was given a warning, the case is closed and no further action is
required. If the property owner was provided a citation, it becomes final and
the property owner must pay their fine. All fines will be paid through the City
Clerk’s Office and the City Clerk shall manage the collection of delinquent
fines. Once delinquent fines/liens have exceeded $3,000 in total, the Clerk’s
Office will notify the City Administrator, who will conduct a financial
analysis to determine if foreclosure proceedings should be pursued.
   (B)   The city shall possess a lien on property owned by the person found by
a non-appealable final order as defined by KRS § 65.8805(8), or by a final
judgment of the court, to have committed a violation of a city ordinance. The
lien shall be for all civil fines assessed for the violation and for all
charges and fees incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of the
ordinance, including abatement costs.
   (C)   The lien shall be recorded in the Office of the County Clerk. The lien
shall be noticed to all persons from the time of its recording and shall bear
interest until paid. The lien shall continue for ten years following the date
of the non-appealable final order or final court judgment.
   (D)   Subject to §
44.13, the lien shall take precedence over all other liens, except state,
county, school board, and city taxes, and may be enforced by judicial
proceedings, including a foreclosure action.
   (E)   In addition to the remedy prescribed in division (A) above, the person
found to have committed the violation shall be personally responsible for the
amount of all civil fines assessed for the violation and for all charges, fees
and abatement costs incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of
the ordinance. The city may bring a civil action against the person and shall
have the same remedies as provided for the recovery of a debt.
(Ord. 2560, passed 6-6-2023)
§ 44.13 LIENS.
   (A)   A lienholder of record who has registered pursuant to §
44.12(B) may, within 45 days from the date of issuance of notification under §
44.12(C):
      (1)   Correct the violation, if it has not already been abated; or
      (2)   Pay all civil fines assessed for the violation, and all charges and
fees incurred by the city in connection with enforcement of the ordinance,
including abatement costs.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from taking immediate
action if necessary under §
44.14.
   (C)   The lien provided by §
44.12 shall not take precedence over previously recorded liens if:
      (1)   The city failed to comply with the requirements of §
44.12 for notification of the final order; or
      (2)   A prior lienholder complied with division (A) above.
   (D)   A lien that does not take precedence over previously recorded liens
under division (C) above shall, if the final order remains partially
unsatisfied, continue to take precedence over all other subsequent liens except
liens for state, county, school board and city taxes.
   (E)   The city may record a lien before the 45-day period established in
division (A) above expires. If the lien is fully satisfied prior to the
expiration of the 45-day period, the city shall release the lien in the County
Clerk’s Office where the lien is recorded within 15 days of satisfaction.
   (F)   Failure of the city to comply with §§
44.12 or
44.13, or failure of a lien to take precedence over previously filed liens as
provided in division (C) above, shall not limit or restrict any other remedies
the city has against the property of the violator.
(Ord. 2560, passed 6-6-2023)
§ 44.14 IMMEDIATE ACTION.
   Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit the city from taking immediate
action to remedy a violation of its ordinances when there is reason to believe
that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and
welfare, or if in the absence of immediate action, the effects of the violation
will be irreparable or irreversible.

      (1)   Shall have all or part or the legal title to any dwelling or
dwelling unit, with or without accompanying actual possession thereof, or shall
have all or part of the beneficial ownership of any dwelling or dwelling unit
and a right to present use and enjoyment thereof, including a mortgage in
possession; or
      (2)   Shall have charge, care of or control of any dwelling or dwelling

(1996 Code, § 92.55) (Ord. 1814, passed 4-16-1985)
§ 92.16 SMOKE DETECTORS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Subject to any exceptions and conditions for compliance as stated
herein, six months after the effective date of this subchapter, smoke detectors
shall be required in all dwellings privately owned or rented for occupancy. It
shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new or existing occupied
dwelling unit to install smoke detectors in each dwelling unit as hereinafter
provided. The smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing visible or invisible
particles of combustion and providing a suitable audible (or visual for the
deaf or hearing-impaired) alarm.
   (B)   This subchapter shall apply to any and all dwellings or dwelling
units, new or existing, which do not fall under the jurisdiction of the
currently adopted Kentucky Building Code or the currently adopted Life Safety
Code (LSC 101).
(1996 Code, § 92.56) (Ord. 1814, passed 4-16-1985) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.17 TYPE AND PLACEMENT.
   (A)   Compliance; alternatives:
      (1)   In order to comply with this subchapter, only ionization or
photoelectric type detectors approved by a nationally-recognized testing
laboratory shall be installed; and
      (2)   Alternative: as an alternative to self-contained smoke detectors,
under certain limited conditions (such as battery-powered smoke detectors), an
approved fire detection system or a combination thereof may be installed. The
Fire Inspector of the city may subjectively, and on a case-by-case basis,
approve each and every alternative system in written form.
   (B)   Smoke detectors in new residential dwellings shall be wired directly
(hard-wired) to the building’s power supply. In existing buildings, it is
preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power supply. However,
detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery or operated by an electrical
plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device, provided that the
outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the main power supply.
   (C)   Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with applicable NFPA
Standards (see § 92.19). Detectors may be ceiling or wall mounted, provided
that if wall mounted they shall be within 12 inches, but not closer than, six
inches of the ceiling.
   (D)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area. A SLEEPING AREA is defined as the area or areas of the dwelling
unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping rooms) are located. Where bedrooms or
rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other used areas (such as
kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section. In a
dwelling unit which contains a well-defined sleeping room separated from the
other activity areas of the same unit, the detector shall be located in the
corridor within the unit or interior area giving direct access to the rooms
used for sleeping purposes. Where sleeping areas are separated and where a
single smoke detector will not adequately service all sleeping areas, there
shall be smoke detectors installed adjacent to each sleeping area.
   (E)   In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally located on the
ceiling.
   (F)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any rooming
unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each
dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally located
common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately service all sleeping
areas.
   (G)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed in or under each
stairway leading up to an occupied area in a manner as to assure that rising
smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector and the detector intercepts
rising smoke before it reaches the occupied areas.
(1996 Code, § 92.57) (Ord. 1814, passed 4-16-1985) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.18 INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for supplying and
installing in an operable condition the required detectors and for providing
maintenance and testing in an owner-occupied residence; or for providing the
manufacturer’s maintenance and testing instructions to a tenant in the case of
rental property.
   (B)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for maintenance and
testing of detectors, in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions, which are
located in common areas or detectors in rooming units where the tenant usually
has short periods of occupancy (hotels, motels, rooming or tourist homes).
   (C)   The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and testing the
detector, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, which are within
his or her exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant shall
be responsible for notifying, in writing, the owner when a detector becomes
inoperable, whereafter the owner has ten days in which to repair or replace in
operable condition that detector. In the battery-operated type of detector,
battery replacement shall be the responsibility of the tenant.
   (D)   At every change of tenancy, it shall be the duty of the owner to test
and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition prior to re-renting the unit.
   (E)   At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by or
incidental to a sale, lease or sublease of the unit, it shall be the duty of
the grantor thereof (such as the seller, lessor or sublessor, as the case may
be) to provide, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke detectors
as required by this section (or other applicable laws) are installed and in
proper working condition. Failure to comply with this division (E) shall be
punishable as set forth herein; provided, however, that this division (E) shall
not be construed to violate or render void any contract, lease or sublease
subject hereto.
   (F)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly connected
(permanently wired) to the electrical system of a structure without the proper
electrical certification.

   This section is intended to be used with, and supplemented by, the
applicable provisions of the National Fire Protection Standards No. 72 (current
edition) which are hereby incorporated herein. However, if there shall be any
conflict between this subchapter and the supplemental standards, this
subchapter and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall
prevail. All amendments to or changes in NFPA Standard No. 72 shall be adopted
and made part thereof without further reference.

have been installed and located therein according to the requirements and
specifications hereof.

§ 104.04 CITY STAFF PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Complaints of violations of this chapter are generally received from
the public, city staff, or observed by city Citation Officers. When a complaint
is received, a Citation Officer is assigned the complaint. The Citation Officer
shall document the complaint and determine if it is valid or unfounded. If
found to be valid, the resident is notified of the violation through a warning

violation in seven days. If the violation has been corrected and the property
owner was given a warning, the case is closed and no further action is
required. If the property owner was provided a citation, it becomes final and
the property owner must pay their fine. All fines will be paid through the
Clerk’s Office and the City Clerk shall manage the collection of delinquent
fines. Once delinquent fines/liens have exceeded $3,000 in total, the Clerk’s
Office will notify the City Administrator, who will conduct a financial
analysis to determine if foreclosure proceedings should be pursued.
   (B)   City Council shall be notified of each foreclosure analysis on a case-
by-case basis.
      (1)   In the case the city proceeds to foreclosure proceedings, the city
shall be represented at the Master Commissioner Sale by the City Administrator
or staff designee.
      (2)   If foreclosure is initiated by others (bank, county, etc.). the
City Clerk’s Office shall provide all necessary information to get the city
paid by the Kenton Circuit Court, including involving the City Attorney in the
filing of an answer/counter claim.
   (C)   The City Clerk’s Office shall collect all fines and negotiate
payments, if applicable, with permission of the City Administrator and the
Mayor.
   (D)   The City Clerk’s Office shall initiate the filing of liens when
appropriate. The City Clerk’s Office shall complete the lien paperwork and work
in conjunction with the City Attorney, and submit it to the City Administrator

§ 110.03 BUSINESS REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Requirements. 
      (1)   Everybody who is engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,

permit fee, in the fee amount established by Kenton County Fiscal Court.

110.04.
   (B)   Prohibitions. Nobody, other than those who are only engaged as
employees in the city, shall conspire, cause, permit, promote, allow, aid,
assist, encourage or engage in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or

required by this chapter and the application for it shall be determined by
Kenton County Fiscal Court.

regulatory license required by this chapter shall be signed by the applicant or
an authorized representative of the applicant, who shall attest to the truth of
the statements therein, with knowledge that any false statements constitute
perjury, for which the signatory may be prosecuted and punished according to
law; and such signatures shall be notarized according to law.
      (2)   Payment of fees for new or renewed applications. Each application
for an annual business regulatory license required by this chapter shall be
presented to Kenton County Fiscal Court, along with both the business
regulatory license fee and any occupational license fee that is due from the
applicant. No new application for a business regulatory license or renewal of
such license shall be accepted or issued by Kenton County Fiscal Court without
payment of the business regulatory license fee and any occupational license fee
due from the applicant. In the event a license is issued or renewed without
payment of any necessary fees, the City Administrator may initiate a revocation
or suspension of that license until fees are paid by the applicant.
      (3)   Review of application by City Administrator. Each application for
an annual occupational license required hereby shall be immediately forwarded
to and reviewed by the City Administrator according to the following standards
within 30 days after actual receipt by Kenton County Fiscal Court:
         (a)   When the applicant, or employees of the applicant, are required
to have any license, permit, degree, certification or other similar document
pursuant to the provision of any applicable law for the conduct of or
employment in the business which is the subject of the application; the
license, permit, degree, certification or other similar document shall have
been duly issued to the applicant or employees of the applicant prior to the
issuance of the occupational license. The applicant shall provide documentary
evidence of the issuance satisfactory to the City Administrator.
         (b)   The criminal record of the persons named or identified in the
application shall be considered to the extent such record includes conviction
of a felony, a misdemeanor for which imprisonment or other confinement was a
possible penalty, any other crime in which moral turpitude was involved; or any
other crime which was directly related to a business of the type which is the
subject of the application. In determining if a conviction was directly related
to a business, the City Administrator shall consider:
            1.   The nature and seriousness of the crime for which the person
was convicted;
            2.   The relationship of the crime to the purpose of the regulation
of the business;
            3.   The relationship of the crime to the ability, capacity and
fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of
the operation of the business; and
            4.   The extent to which the person convicted has been successfully
rehabilitated.
         (c)   The City Administrator shall consider whether the business is of
a type that the operation, unless closely supervised, has a probability of
generating or resulting in criminal activity or adversely affecting the health,
safety, morals and welfare of occupants or residents of adjoining property, the
citizens and residents of the city, or will constitute a nuisance.
         (d)   The City Administrator shall consider the business history of
the applicant including:
            1.   Whether the persons named and identified in the application
have been denied or had suspended or revoked a similar license by the city or
any other city, county or state and the reasons therefor; and
            2.   Whether complaints have been received by the city about the
business practices or responsibility of the persons named and identified in the
application, and the disposition of those complaints.
         (e)   The City Administrator shall consider whether the persons named
and identified in the application are indebted to the city for delinquent
taxes, assessments, liens, fines, penalties, or similar obligations.
         (f)   The City Administrator shall consider whether the business and
the proposed location complies with all applicable laws, including, without
limitation, land subdivision and use, zoning, building construction and
maintenance, and fire prevention and life safety codes and regulations.
      (4)   Approval of application. Unless the City Administrator
conditionally approves or disapproves the application for an occupational
license within 30 days after the application has been received by or on behalf
of the city, Kenton County Fiscal Court shall issue the occupational license
that is the subject of the application and mail it to the applicant at the
address indicated in the application; and, thereafter, the applicant may engage
in the franchise, trade, occupation, profession, or other business described in
the application, but only at the address thereof indicated in the application,
until that occupational license expires or is suspended or revoked according to
the provisions of this chapter. The business license shall become effective
upon notice served upon the licensee or posted on the premises affected.
      (5)   Conditional approval of application.
         (a)   In the event that the City Administrator conditionally approves
an application for an occupational license, the City Administrator shall notify
the applicant thereof and the reasons therefore by mail to the address of the
applicant indicated in the application, along with, a notice that the license
will be issued by Kenton County only upon receipt by the City Administrator of
a written signed acceptance by the applicant of the conditions to be performed
prior to the issuance of the license. The notice shall also state that if the
City Administrator does not receive the acceptance within such time, the
application will thereby be summarily disapproved.
         (b)   The City Administrator may issue a conditional approval as a
reinstatement of a revoked or suspended business license. Conditional approval
may be granted after all debt is paid and violations are corrected. The City
Administrator may approve a conditional approval for businesses that have had
past violations. Businesses may be issued a conditional approval for 12 months
to demonstrate future compliance prior to being issued a standard license. The
following conditions may be placed on a business:
         (c)   Conditions:
            1.   Post bond with surety in a reasonable amount of based on the
annual license fee for the following year.
            2.   Prepay 90% of the annual license fee.

certain parts of the premises to observe the building, business practices and
business records.

before a specified date.
      (6)   Disapproval of application. In the event that the City
Administrator disapproves an application for a new or renewal occupational
license required hereby, Kenton County Fiscal Court shall notify the applicant
of that denial and the reasons therefore identified by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the address of the applicant indicated in the
application, with a refund of any anticipated city occupational license fee
paid with the application, and a notice of the procedure established in this
chapter for an appeal from the denial of that application.
      (7)   Occupational license revocation or suspension by the City
Administrator. Any occupational license required hereby may be revoked or
suspended by the City Administrator for any period of time determined by the
City Administrator to be reasonable and appropriate for any one or more of the
following circumstances:
         (a)   Any conditions or considerations which, had they existed at the
time of issuance, or had the City Administrator had knowledge of those
circumstances, would have been grounds for denial.
         (b)   Any false or intentionally misleading statement or information
provided in the license application;
         (c)   Any failure or refusal to perform or abide by any of the
conditions of a conditional license;
         (d)   The criminal conviction of any person named or identified in the
license application of a felony, a misdemeanor for which imprisonment or any
other confinement is a possible penalty, any other crime in which moral
turpitude is involved, or any other crime which directly relates to a business
of the type for which the license was issued. However, the consideration of
such a criminal conviction shall include:
            1.   The nature and seriousness of the crime for which the person
was convicted;
            2.   The relationship of the crime to the purposes of the
regulation of the business;
            3.   The relationship of the crime to the ability, capacity and
fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of
the operation of the business; and
            4.   The extent to which the person has been successfully
rehabilitated.
         (e)   The revocation, suspension or expiration without renewal of any
license, permit, degree, certification or similar document which is required by
any applicable law for the conduct of or employment in the business for which
the license was issued;
         (f)   Where the business is a disorderly house, or to permit lewd,
indecent or immoral acts to be committed therein, or on the premises adjacent
thereto and under the control of the person conducting such business, or to
permit on such premises or adjacent premises any lewd, boisterous or obscene
conversations, sounds or other noises, or to permit such premises to be used
for the purposes of prostitution, assignation or other immoral or illegal
purposes or otherwise to become a nuisance;
         (g)   The violation of any applicable law in the conduct of the

circumstances of revocation or suspension described within division (7) above
with regard to any application for occupational license or anybody mentioned
therein, the City Administrator or his or her designee shall attempt informally
to contact the applicant at either the address set forth within the application
or the telephone number set forth therein, and, if the contact attempt is
successful:
            1.   Disclose said circumstances to the applicant;
            2.   Indicate to the applicant that if the circumstances are shown
to the City Administrator to be accurate, then the occupational license may be
revoked or suspended by the City Administrator;
            3.   Request that the applicant confirm or deny the truth of the
circumstances; and
            4.   Obtain any explanation or evidence from the applicant with
regard to the presence or absence of the circumstances. One of the attempts to

occupational license after his or her attempts to contact the application are

suspension, if the applicant provides a written plan to improve those
conditions.
         (c)   After considering the evidence of the existence of the
circumstances described in division (7) above, the City Administrator may

67.753(4), it is hereby determined that the apportionment provisions of KRS
67.753 do not fairly represent the extent of the engagement in the city of
those, other than employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business both within and outside of the city;
and, accordingly, the following described property factor is hereby added to
the payroll factor and the sales factor provided in KRS 67.753 for the
apportionment of the gross receipts of those, other than employees, who are
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business both
within and outside of the city.
      (1)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or
rented and used in the city during the computation period, and the denominator
of which is the average value of all of the taxpayer’s real and tangible
personal property owned or rented and used anywhere during the computation
period. In the determination of the property factor:
         (a)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.
Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental
rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual
rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub-rentals; and
         (b)   The average value of property shall be determined by averaging
the values at the beginning and ending of the computation period, but the City
Administrative Officer may require the averaging of monthly values during the
computation period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value
of the taxpayer’s property.
      (2)   The proportion of the total gross receipts everywhere of those,
other than employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business both within and outside of the city that are
subject to the occupational license fee established by this chapter, shall be
determined by multiplying the total gross receipts thereof everywhere by the
quotient of the total of the payroll factor and the sales factor described in
KRS 67.753(2) and (3), and the property factor described in the previous
division (C)(1)(a) above, that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business had in the city during the tax period, divided by the total
number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business had in the city during the tax period. The total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the city during the tax period will always be either 1, 2 or 3. For example,
if the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business:
         (a)   Had only the sales revenue factor in the city, during the tax
period, without either the property factor or the payroll factor in the city,
the total number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business had in the city during the tax period would be 1;
         (b)   Had both the sales revenue factor and the payroll factor in the
city, during the tax period, without the property factor in the city, the total
number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business had in the city during the tax period would be 2; or
         (c)   Had the sales revenue factor, and the payroll factor, and the
property factor in the city, during the tax period, the total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the city during the tax period would be 3.
   (D)   Exemptions from taxation. The following franchises, trades,
occupations, professions and other businesses are exempted from the
occupational license fee levied and imposed in §
110.05(A) and (B) of this chapter:
      (1)   The employment of domestic servants in private homes;
      (2)   Organizations that have been determined to be exempt from federal
income taxation pursuant to § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
as amended; and
      (3)   Owners of their principal and primary residence, who let or lease
no more than one separate residential unit in that principal and primary
residence.
   (E)   Penalties and interest.
      (1)   A business entity subject to tax on gross receipts may be subject
to a penalty equal to 5% of the tax due for each calendar month or fraction
thereof if the business entity:
         (a)   Fails to file any return or report on or before the due date
prescribed for filing or as extended by the city; or
         (b)   Fails to pay the tax computed on the return or report on or
before the due date prescribed for payment.
         (c)   The total penalty levied pursuant to this division shall not
exceed 25% of the total tax due; however, the penalty shall not be less than
$25.
      (2)   Every employer who fails to file a return or pay the tax for
quarterly occupational license fees on or before the due date is subject to a
penalty in amount equal to 5% of the tax due for each calendar month or
fraction thereof. The total penalty levied pursuant to this division shall not
exceed 25% of the total tax due; however, the penalty shall not be less than
$25.
      (3)   In addition to the penalties prescribed in this section, any
business entity or employer shall pay, as part of the tax, an amount equal to
12% per annum simple interest on the tax shown due, but not previously paid,
from the time the tax was due until the tax is paid to the city. A fraction of
a month is counted as an entire month.
      (4)   Every tax imposed by this chapter, and all increases, interest, and
penalties thereon, shall become, from the time the tax is due and payable, a
personal debt of the taxpayer to the city.
      (5)   The city may enforce the collection of the occupational tax due
under this chapter and any fees, penalties, and interest as provided in this
chapter by civil action in a court of appropriate [text missing].

§ 110.05 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   In addition to penalties and interest imposed on taxes due to the city, the
City Administrator may issue civil penalties for violations of this chapter by
business entities. Each separate violation, for each day, of this chapter is
hereby classified as a civil offense, for which:
   (A)   The maximum civil fine required by KRS 65.8808(2)(b) that may be

   (B)   The specific civil fine required by KRS 65.8808(2)(c) that will be
imposed for each separate offense and violation of this chapter if the person
who has committed the violation and offense does not contest a citation
therefore, is hereby established as $100.
   (C)   An enforcement officer may, in lieu of immediately issuing a civil
citation, give notice that the violation of this chapter shall be remedied
within a specific period of time.
(Ord. 2539, passed 4-5-2022)
§ 110.06 CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

110.05, any business entity or employer who willfully fails to make a return,
willfully makes a false return, or willfully fails to pay taxes owing or
collected, with the intent to evade payment of the tax or amount collected, or
any part thereof, shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
   (B)   Each separate violation, for each day, of this chapter shall be a
misdemeanor for which everybody convicted thereof in a court of competent
jurisdiction shall be sentenced to pay a criminal fine not to exceed the
maximum amount of $500 as set forth in KRS 534.050(2)(a) or a term of
imprisonment not to exceed the maximum period of 12 months as set forth in KRS
532.090(1), or both.
