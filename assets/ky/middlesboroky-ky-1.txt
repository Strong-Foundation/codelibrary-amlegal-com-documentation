finding of facts in writing surrounding the underlying grievance. In the event

specified remedial action immediately. The Mayor shall proceed to take the
specified corrective or remedial action immediately, which may include the
award of back pay. There shall be no other monetary damages allowable.

all Board members.
   (F)   (1)   The person to whom the citation is issued shall respond to the
citation within seven days of the date of issuance by either paying the civil

violation was committed shall be considered final. In this event, the citation
as issued shall be deemed a final order determining that the violation was
committed and imposing the civil fine as set forth in the citation, and the
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order to
District Court.
      (2)   Notice of a final order shall be provided to the cited violator by

fine set forth in the citation, and the alleged violator shall be deemed to

§ 34.02 FISCAL POLICIES.
   (A)   A new set of procedures shall be adopted pertaining to procurement of
goods and services by sealed bid, negotiated process, and small purchase. Small
purchases are items that cost less than $7,500 in aggregate according to KRS
45A.385. These new procedures will apply to all departments and will ensure the
maximum return for city tax dollars expended.
   (B)   All city expenses will be approved by the Mayor as provided for in KRS
91A.060. The small purchase procedures will ensure the integrity of this
process. Also, this process will provide the following advantages and savings
to the city:
      (1)   Save tremendously on copying costs;
      (2)   Save on clerical staff time;
      (3)   Provide additional time at Council meetings for the City Council to
devote to more important matters; and
      (4)   Permit the city to be current with all vendors. It should be noted
that all city expenses, with or without this process, are open to public
scrutiny and that every Council member would be welcomed to review the monthly
bills (invoices) of the city.
   (C)   Two or three days shall be designated per month for expenses to be
paid (check preparation and signing).
   (D)   A monthly financial report shall be prepared and presented to the City
Council, rather than a quarterly report.
   (E)   Beginning with fiscal year 1990, the Mayor will provide a new and
somewhat modified form for the annual budget ordinance and detailed operating
budget.
   (F)   The city’s privilege license ordinance shall be revised and updated.
The current ordinance is outdated and is not comprehensive.
   (G)   An inventory system for equipment, tools, vehicles, office furniture,
and the like shall be established.
   (H)   The City Council shall consider the possibilities of establishing a
long-range capital improvements program/budget for the replacement of equipment
in the various departments.
   (I)   The elected officials of the city should investigate all possible ways
to enhance revenues and provide a maximum level of service for each dollar
expended. This may include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Revising all revenue generating ordinances;
      (2)   Establishing a cash management and investment plan to earn the
maximum interest on idle funds; and
      (3)   Establishing a procurement procedure for professional services.
(Prior Code, § 34.02) (Ord. FY 88-89, #17, passed 4-18-1989)
§ 34.03 PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES FOR CITY PURCHASES.
   (A)   Policy statement. It is the intent of the city to provide the maximum
return from expenditures for commodities and services. The city will strive to
procure all goods and services by and through the competitive process.
   (B)   Responsibility.
      (1)   The Mayor is responsible for performance and administration of the
procurement function of the city.
      (2)   The Mayor hereby delegates to the City Clerk and to each department
head the authority to make small purchases for their respective departments in
accordance with the procedures contained herein.
   (C)   Small purchase procedures.
      (1)   Small purchases are items that cost less than the amount stipulated
in KRS 45A.385.
      (2)   There shall be no requirement for bids to be obtained for purchases
amounting to less than $100. All such purchases will, however, require the
written approval of the appropriate department head.
      (3)   A department head with delegated authority shall obtain three price
quotes from vendors whenever practicable, and the one most advantageous to the
city or the department shall be selected. Where two or more local suppliers
offer the same product at substantially the same price, the person in charge of
procurement should purchase from each on a rotating basis.
      (4)   The department head shall prepare a “purchase order requisition” to
submit to the City Clerk’s office for issuance of a purchase order. The
purchase order requisition should be dated, numbered by department, and contain
the following information:
         (a)   Department making the request;
         (b)   A written description of the item or service to be purchased;
         (c)   The vendors contacted with price quote(s);
         (d)   Budget account to be charged;
         (e)   Signature of requesting department head; and
         (f)   Mayor’s approval, if required.
      (5)   Any small purchase exceeding $200 shall be approved by the Mayor
signing the purchase order requisition; provided, however, that if the purchase
amount exceeds $200 by 10% solely due to the addition of subsequent incidental
charges, the Mayor’s approval shall not be necessary.
      (6)   The department head shall maintain one copy of the purchase order
requisition and one copy of the purchase order.
      (7)   The City Clerk or designee shall issue a purchase order after
ascertaining the available budget amount. The City Clerk will maintain one copy
of the purchase order for the unpaid bills file and one photocopy thereof to be
filed numerically.
      (8)   Emergency small purchases shall require that a purchase order
requisition and purchase order with explanation attached be prepared within
three working days after the purchase. Also, acceptable purchases of this
nature could be for:
         (a)   Establishing evidence and/or maintaining the scene of a crime,
fire, and the like; and
         (b)   Situations where there is only one vendor who can supply the
essential goods or service.
      (9)   Selection of maintenance service on vehicles and equipment must be
both practical and advantageous to the city. Quality work and turn around time
at a reasonable price should be the standard to achieve. However, in reality,
down time and quality work are very important. With these points in mind the
department head should choose a vendor that is most practical and advantageous
to the city.
      (10)   It is understood that this procurement ordinance is to benefit the
city in both price and down time of equipment. The small purchases procedure is
for the convenience of the department head and not to be misused through split
invoicing. Repeated history of billing more than one invoice for essentially
the same job shall be subject to reprimand.
   (D)   Sealed bidding procedures.
      (1)   The department, official or person requiring a contract or purchase
from city funds not covered by small purchase procedures shall submit to the
Mayor a written request containing specifications, quantities, and delivery
desired.
      (2)   The Mayor shall examine the request and approve or reject it based
on the needs of the city and whether such items are provided for in the budget.
If the request is approved, the Mayor shall inform the City Council when
competitive sealed bidding will commence.
      (3)   The City Clerk shall place an appropriate advertisement in the
newspaper and shall open all bids publicly at the time and place stated in the
advertisement.
      (4)   The City Clerk shall submit all responsive bids to the Mayor, who
shall open the bids in the presence of the City Council and shall select the
lowest or the lowest evaluated bid by a qualified bidder, subject to approval
by the City Council, prior to awarding a contract. The City Clerk shall notify
all bidders of the award.
      (5)   The Mayor shall sign a contract with and issue a purchase order to
the bidder receiving the award.
   (E)   Negotiated procedures.
      (1)   Negotiated procedures may be used instead of sealed bids when the
amount exceeds the amount stipulated in KRS 45A.385 for small purchase
procedures and when the Mayor makes a written determination that:
         (a)   An emergency exists which will result in danger to health,
safety, or property;
         (b)   All bids received exceed the amount budgeted, if three or more
bids were received; or
         (c)   The item or project will not be funded with federal funds.
      (2)   One copy of the determination shall be submitted to the City Clerk
and another copy placed in the file.
      (3)   When the prerequisites set out in divisions (E)(1)(a), (E)(1)(b),
or (E)(1)(c) of this section have been met for the use of the negotiated
process, the Mayor or his or her designee shall proceed to negotiate with one
or more suppliers in order to obtain the most advantageous terms.
      (4)   The best negotiated proposal shall be submitted to the Mayor for
approval. The Mayor shall inform the City Council prior to awarding a contract.
The Clerk shall notify the person awarded the contract.
      (5)   The City Clerk shall prepare a record of all negotiated contracts,
showing the items and quantities acquired, name of suppliers, cost, and date of
each contract.
   (F)   Procurement of professional services. The procurement of professional
services shall be by the request for proposals (RFP) method, as more
particularly described in KRS 45A.370, which is incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.
   (G)   Applicability.
      (1)   These procurement policies shall not apply to any federally funded
project. Federal funds shall be considered as those coming from such agencies
as:
         (a)   Appalachian Regional Commission – ARC;
         (b)   Farmers Home Administration – FmHA;
         (c)   Community Development Block Grant – CDBG;
         (d)   Economic Development Administration – EDA; and
         (e0   Environmental Protection Agency – EPA
      (2)   These procurement policies shall apply to all departments, except
as prohibited in division (F) of this section.

which shall include the government-wide and fund financial statements;
      (2)   The auditor shall include in the annual or biennial city audit
report an examination of local government economic assistance funds granted to
the city under KRS 42.450 to 42.495. The auditor shall include a certification

purpose intended;
      (3)   All audit information be prepared in accordance with generally
accepted governmental auditing standards which include tests of the accounting

      (4)   The auditor shall prepare a typewritten or printed report
embodying:
         (a)   The basic financial statements and accompanying supplemental and
required supplemental information;
         (b)   The auditor’s opinion on the basic financial statements or
reasons why an opinion cannot be expressed; and
         (c)   Findings required to be reported as a result of the audit.
      (5)   The completed audit and all accompanying documentation shall be
presented to the city legislative body at a regular or special meeting; and
      (6)   Any contract with a certified public accountant for an audit shall
require the accountant to forward a copy of the audit report and management
letters to the Auditor of Public Accounts upon request of the city or the
Auditor of Public Accounts, and the Auditor of Public Accounts shall have the
right to review the certified public accountant’s work papers upon request.
   (E)   A copy of an audit report which meets the requirements of this section
shall be considered satisfactory and final in meeting any official request to a
city for financial data, except for statutory or judicial requirements, or
requirements of the Legislative Research Commission necessary to carry out the
purposes of KRS 6.955 to 6.975.
   (F)   Each city shall, within 30 days after the presentation of an audit to
the city legislative body, publish an advertisement in accordance with KRS
Chapter 424 containing:
      (1)   The auditor’s opinion letter;
      (2)   The “Budgetary Comparison Schedules-Major Funds”, which shall
include the General Fund and all major funds;
      (3)   A statement that a copy of the complete audit report, including
financial statements and supplemental information, is on file at City Hall and
is available for public inspection during normal business hours;

   (G)   Any resident of the city or owner of real property within the city may
bring an action in the circuit court to enforce the provisions of this section.

any of the provisions of this section shall, for each failure, be subject to a
forfeiture of not less than $50 nor more than $500, in the discretion of the
court, which may be recovered only once in a civil action brought by any
resident of the city or owner of real property within the city. The costs of
all proceedings, including a reasonable fee for the attorney of the resident or
property owner bringing the action, shall be assessed against the unsuccessful
party.
   (H)   In the event of extenuating circumstances that prevent a city from
completing and submitting a required audit or financial statement in compliance
with the applicable deadlines in division (A) of this section, the city may
submit a written request for an extension of time to the Department for Local
Government on a form prescribed by the Department for Local Government. The
Department for Local Government shall approve the request if it is submitted on
or before the applicable deadline and, in the judgment of the Department for
Local Government, the request is warranted by extenuating circumstances beyond
the control of the city. Extensions granted under this division (H) shall not
exceed nine months from the original due date of the audit or financial
statement. If the Department for Local Government approves an extension for a
city and the city fails to complete and submit the required audit or financial
statement in compliance with that extended deadline, then the provisions of
division (I) of this section shall apply.
   (I)   If a city fails to complete an audit or financial statement and submit

requirements of this section, and that any funds in the possession of any
agency, entity, or branch of state government shall be withheld from the city
until further notice. The Department for Local Government shall immediately
notify the Finance and Administration Cabinet when the city complies with the
requirements of divisions (A) and (H) of this section for all prior fiscal
years it has failed to comply with the audit requirements of this section, and
the Finance and Administration Cabinet shall direct the reinstatement of
payments to the city, including any funds that were withheld due to the
noncompliance.

examination conducted pursuant to KRS 43.050, the Auditor shall bill the city
for the actual expense of the audit or examination conducted. The actual
expense shall include the hours of work performed on the audit or examination
as well as reasonable associated costs, including but not limited to travel
costs. The bill submitted to the city shall include a statement of the hourly
rate, total hours, and total costs for the entire audit or examination.

public agency without the written permission of the official custodian of the
record.

hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from the city
through the mail if the applicant’s residence or principal place of business is
outside of the county in which the city is located and he or she has precisely

custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of
mailing (KRS 61.872(3).

(Prior Code, § 50.04) (Ord. FY 90-91, #11, passed 11-7-1990) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.05 MONTHLY STATEMENTS.
   (A)   Charges for solid waste collection services performed by the city in a
calendar month at monthly rates shall be due and payable on the first day of
the month.
   (B)   The Department of Solid Waste Management shall be charged with the
duty of mailing a statement to each person charged for waste collection,
removal, or disposal, but failure to mail any statement for monthly charges
shall not be grounds for avoiding payment.
      (1)   The owners of real property in the city are responsible for the
payment of the monthly statement of charges for sanitation services rendered by
the city or its franchisee in the hauling of refuse, solid waste, trash and
garbage from the premises.
      (2)   Effective July 1, 1991, owners/landlords of rental property,
including apartments, shall be deemed the customer of the city or its
franchisee. Accordingly, said owners/landlords shall thereafter be liable for
the payment of all statements for charges, unless said owners/landlords duly
execute and deliver to the city a written guarantee of payment of statements
for charges in a form which will be promulgated by the city. In that event, the
city shall issue statements for charges to the tenants of said rental property
directly. In the event said tenants default in payment, the city shall have the
right to offset the delinquent charges against the prepaid security deposit
required in division (C) of this section. Should the delinquency continue to
the point that the security deposit is insufficient to satisfy same, the city
shall be entitled to directly bill the owner/landlord for all subsequent
delinquent charges. By electing to request the city to initially bill the
tenants for this service in lieu of holding the owner/landlord directly liable,
the owner/landlord waives any objection to direct billing after default. If the
owners/landlords elect to pass along the charges as additional rent in lieu of
executing the aforementioned guarantee, the city or its franchisee shall not be
required to look to or bill the tenant therefor, but rather shall bill the
owner/landlord directly. If a vacancy should occur in such rental property, the
landlord shall notify the city within ten days of the vacancy and his or her
statement for charges shall be proportionately reduced. Failure to so notify
the city shall waive the right to the reduction for that month.
   (C)   All customers of the city or its franchisee who apply for service
after the effective date of enactment of this chapter shall be required to give
the city or its franchisee, as applicable, a refundable security deposit in an
amount equivalent to the charge for three months’ service. As stipulated
hereinbefore, in the event of default, the city will be entitled to apply the
security deposit to any deficiency in account payment by said customer, in
addition to pursuing any other remedies available to the city in this chapter,
at law or in equity. In the event the customer moves or terminates service for
some other reason and the customer’s account is current, the city shall refund
the entire security deposit to said customer following termination of the
service. In the event that the customer establishes 18 consecutive months of
good credit history with the city for the said service, the city shall
thereafter refund the security deposit to the customer. The customer shall not
receive any interest upon the security deposit from the city under any
circumstances.
   (D)   If the fee, rate, or charge for any monthly service charge is not paid
on or before the tenth day of the month for which same is charged, then the
amount thereof shall be delinquent.
   (E)   The failure of any person, company, or corporation receiving such
service to pay for the same before the charge becomes delinquent, shall subject
the person, company, or corporation to a penalty in accordance with §
50.99.
   (F)   Any customer aggrieved by any statement for charges shall be required
to exhaust the administrative remedies set out in §
51.143, incorporated herein by reference, prior to initiation of any litigation
concerning the dispute.
(Prior Code, § 50.05) (Ord. FY 90-91, #11, passed 11-7-1990)
§ 50.06 CHARGES; COLLECTED, RECORDED, AUDITED.
   (A)   The Department of Solid Waste Management shall be the collector of all
charges imposed under the provisions of this chapter, and such Department shall
keep and maintain proper and current records showing all charges assessed and
collected.
   (B)   Charges imposed by any franchisee of the city on a customer will be
billed and collected by the Department of Solid Waste Management.
(Prior Code, § 50.06) (Ord. FY 90-91, #11, passed 11-7-1990)
§ 50.07 SCHEDULE OF FEES OR CHARGES.
   (A)   In order to make the service proposed in this chapter revenue-
producing and to pay the costs and expenses required to provide such services
and necessary facilities, there shall be, and there is established, a schedule
of fees, rates, and charges for refuse collection, removal, and disposal which
shall be collected as follows:
      (1)   Commercial and industrial. Thirty-five dollar rental fee on
dumpster per month; $18.50 per pickup per dumpster; pickups for commercial and
industrial shall be scheduled by Superintendent of Solid Waste Management
depending on each individual customer;
      (2)   Residential. Charges for pickups per residence will be $8.50 per
month for once a week pickups. Additional pickups are charged at $8.50 per
trip; and
      (3)   Residential elderly. Where the head of a household or spouse of the
head of the household is 65 years of age or older and either is retired and
receive a fixed income the charge shall be $6.50 per month. Where the head of
the household is single and is 65 years of age or older the charge shall be
$6.50 per month. In order to qualify for the reduced rate, the customer shall
have the affirmative obligation to make application therefor to the City Clerk
and furnish any evidence as the city officials might require. In the event that
the customer is listed on the city ad valorem tax records as qualifying for
homestead exemption in accordance with KRS 132.810, there will be rebuttable
presumption that the customer qualifies for the residential elderly rate.
   (B)   The fees established hereinabove may be waived by the city in
conjunction with a community-wide clean-up effort.

revise the schedule of rates and charges provided in §
50.07 and to so adjust them from time to time that costs will be distributed as
equitably as possible among all citizens and users on the basis of the services
provided hereunder. At no time, however, shall rates be continued which are
found to be producing less revenue than is required to meet all obligations and
expense involved in rendering refuse service hereunder to the public and for
the payment of notes or bonds issued by the city hereafter to provide funds
required to defray the expense of furnishing and providing the refuse services
required by this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the city
and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws
required by the Clean Water Act of 1977, being 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq. and
the general pretreatment regulations (40 C.F.R. part 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
sanitary sewer system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting biosolids;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
sanitary sewer system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters so as to cause violations of the city’s KPDES permit or
the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To promote the reuse, recycling, and reclamation of wastewaters and
sludges from the treatment system;
      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance, and replacement of the municipal sanitary sewer system;
      (5)   To protect municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage,
sludge, and/or effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting
the general public; and
      (6)   To ensure that the municipality complies with its KPDES permit or
non-discharging permit conditions, biosolids permit conditions, including use
and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state environmental laws to
which the municipal sanitary sewer system is subject.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contribution to the municipal sanitary sewer system through the issuance of
permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein. This chapter also provides for the regulation of sanitary sewer
extensions, lateral lines, manholes, and connections.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the city’s municipal
wastewater system, including those users located outside the city who are, by
permit, contract or agreement with the city, users of the sanitary sewer
system. Except as otherwise provided herein, the pretreatment coordinator shall
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers
granted to or imposed upon the pretreatment coordinator may be delegated by the
pretreatment coordinator to other qualified city personnel. By discharging
wastewater into the municipal wastewater system, all users located outside the
city limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions established in this
chapter, as well as any permits, enforcement actions, or orders issued
hereunder.

BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS
§ 51.045 PERMITS.
   (A)   (1)   There shall be two classes of building sewer permits required:
         (a)   For residential; and
         (b)   For service to commercial and industrial establishments.
      (2)   In either case, the owner(s) or his or her agent shall make
application on a special form furnished by the city. Applicants for service to
commercial and industrial establishments shall be required to furnish
information about all waste-producing activities, wastewater characteristics
and constituents. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of
the pretreatment coordinator. Details regarding commercial and industrial
permits include, but are not limited to, those required by this chapter. Permit
and inspection fees shall be paid to the city at the time the application is
filed.
   (B)   Users shall promptly notify the city in advance of any introduction of
wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character of
the wastewater constituents being introduced into the POTW. The pretreatment
coordinator may deny or place conditions on the new introduction or change in
discharge based on the information submitted in the notification or additional
information as may be requested.
   (C)   No person(s) shall uncover, plug, or make any connection with or
opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining permission from the WWTP plant manager.
   (D)   A permit and inspection fee for residential, commercial and industrial
buildings shall be assessed by the city at the time the application is filed.
   (E)   No building permit shall be issued by the city until all building
sewer lines and connections have met all requirements of this chapter and the
Superintendent has been provided with as-built plans and specifications. The
city shall not accept any sewer lines and/or connections that fail smoke or
other leak testing. The property owner and/or installer of any building sewers
shall be responsible for repairing all leaks. A two-year warranty will be
required on all sewer installation, repair, and/or maintenance. This warranty
must be submitted to the WWTP plant manager in writing within 15 days of
completion of the work.
(Prior Code, § 51.035) (Ord. FY 91-92, #29, passed 7-2-1991; Ord. 92-93, #14,
passed 4-20-1993; Ord. FY 20-21, #3, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.046 PROHIBITED CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement wall
seepage, or floor seepage, exterior foundation drains, area way drains, or
other surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which
in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. Any
such connections which already exist on the effective date of this chapter
shall be completely and permanently disconnected within 60 days of the
effective date of this chapter. The owners of any building sewers having such
connections, leaks, or defects shall bear all costs incidental to removal of
such sources. Pipes, sumps, and pumps for such sources of ground and surface
water shall be separate from wastewater facilities. Removal of such sources of
water without presence of separate facilities shall be evidence of drainage to
public sanitary sewer.
      (1)   Connections shall be subject to inspection by the WWTP plant
manager and/or his or her designee to verify compliance.
      (2)   Inspections may be performed periodically at the discretion of the
WWTP plant manager or at the time of connection/reconnection.
   (B)   Floor, basement, or crawl space drains which are lower than ground
surfaces surrounding the building shall not be connected to the building
sanitary sewer. No sanitary inlet which is lower than six inches above the top
of the lowest of the two adjacent public sanitary sewer manholes shall be
connected by direct drainage to the building sanitary sewer. Building sanitary
sewer connections in structures not meeting the criteria of this section will
be permitted only if the property owner has:
      (1)   Installed an individual pumping facility at the structure to
receive the building sewage. The pumping facility shall include a discharge
pipe with a high point which meets the criteria above; or
      (2)   Installed a minimum of two sewer backflow stops or flaps at least
12 inches apart of such nature and design to provide gravity flow to the
sanitary sewer system and to prevent sewage backflow into the property
improvement.
(Prior Code, § 51.036) (Ord. FY 91-92, #29, passed 7-2-1991; Ord. FY 20-21, #3,
passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.047 DESIGN AND INSTALLATION.
   (A)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway. The sewer
from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any
obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such
single connection aforementioned.
   (B)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent, to meet all
requirements of this chapter. Permit and inspection fees for new buildings
using existing building sewers shall be the same as for new building sewers. If
additional sewer customers are added to the old building sewers, additional
sewer tap fees shall be charged accordingly even though no new sewer tap is
actually made into the city system.
   (C)   Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customer’s
side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than that of the
customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be permitted.
   (D)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM A-74, latest
revision, PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) sewer pipe, ASTM C-700, latest revision, or
ductile iron pipe, AWWA specification C-151 cement lined, and shall meet all
requirements of the State Plumbing Code. Joints shall be as set out
hereinafter. Any part of the building sewer that is located within five feet of
a water service pipe shall be constructed with cast iron soil pipe or ductile
iron pipe, unless the building sewer is at least one foot deeper in the ground
than the water service line. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe may be
required by the city where the building sewer is exposed to damage or stoppage
by tree roots. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe shall be used in filled
or unstable ground, in areas where the cover over the building sewer is less
than three feet, or in areas where the sewer is subject to vehicular or other
external loads.
   (E)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the local and state building and plumbing codes and other applicable rules and
regulations of the city. Manholes may be required at all commercial and
industrial connections to the city’s municipal sewer system. The owner of the
facility shall be responsible for all costs associated with installation of the
manhole(s). Specifications for manholes may be obtained by contacting the WWTP
plant manager.
   (F)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection
of the building sewer(s) shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall
indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. Fees for connection shall
be as established by the city.
   (G)   The owner shall ensure that all excavations for building sewer
installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the city.
   (H)   In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the same building sewer.
Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary drainage shall be above
basement floor or in separately watertight or drained sump or channel and must
be inspected and approved by the WWTP plant manager prior to connection to the
system.
   (I)   The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the
easement or property line. Where no property located service branch is
available, an authorized agent of the city shall cut a neat hole into the main
line of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle installed to receive
the building sewer. The invert of the building sewer at such point of
connection with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant of the main line of the
public sewer. A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner
surface of the public sewer, shall be made and the saddle made secure and
watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A
wye and H bend fitting shall be installed at the property line between the
public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a
cleanout and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After
testing, a cast iron or ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and
brought flush with the ground surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type
joint applicable to the pipe used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion
of ground or surface water.
   (J)   All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet or
exceed the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code. All design and
installation of building sanitary sewer lines and facilities shall be in
accordance with the city’s design manual.
   (K)   All persons working on city sewers with a cleaning rod must use an
approved type rod in cleaning sewer connections to city sewers.
   (L)   This section shall not affect sewers installed or approved in
accordance with the provisions of the prior version of the city’s sewer use
ordinance, which was originally adopted on July 2, 1991.
(Prior Code, § 51.037) (Ord. FY 20-21, #3, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.048 INSPECTION.
   (A)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the WWTP
plant manager when the building sewer is ready for connection to the public
sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the WWTP plant
manager or his or her representative. The connections shall be made gastight
and watertight and verified by proper testing.
   (B)   All building sewers shall be air tested through the wye branch at the
public sewer connection, with public sewer tightly plugged off, after
connections at both ends are made and after all pipe is properly bedded and
backfilled at least to top of pipe and if backfill is completed, within two
weeks after completion of backfill. CCTV shall also be conducted in order to
determine the presence of leaks. At time of test, any openings into the
building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any
leakage from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be located at
test by CCTV and repaired to stand repetition of air testing without leakage.
Tests shall be performed at the expense of the property owner in the presence
of an independent inspector provided by the owner or developer. When testing is
completed, the temporary flow line plug shall be removed and a permanent water
tight plug shall be placed in branch of test wye-branch and carefully
backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six inches above the top of the
branch. All results of air testing and CCTV shall be submitted to the city
prior to completion of sewer connection.
(Prior Code, § 51.038) (Ord. FY 20-21, #3, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.049 PERFORMANCE/WARRANTY SURETY.
   (A)   Generally. A performance/warranty surety shall be sufficient to
complete all construction items identified by the WWTP plant manager or his or
her designee on the punch list submitted with the certificate of substantial
completion, and to repair infrastructure due to improper workmanship or
defective materials during the warranty periods. The warranty period is the
time period during which the developer guarantees the work to be free from

         (a)   One hundred percent of the punch list items; plus
         (b)   Ten percent of the cost estimate of the completed project
infrastructure, including roads, sanitary sewer facilities and stormwater
facilities; plus
         (c)   Twenty percent of the sum of the above items to cover
contingencies.
      (2)   The WWTP plant manager shall compute the surety based on the
quantities of materials and the unit costs determined.
   (C)   Total project cost estimate. The cost estimate of the total project
infrastructure shall show the unit cost items and the actual quantities of
construction for roads, sanitary sewer facilities, and stormwater facilities.
For the purpose of establishing the amount of the surety, the total project
cost shall not include such items as site excavation, rock removal, trench rock
for the sanitary sewer, testing of the sanitary sewers, turn lanes constructed
on state rights-of-way, or other similar items.
   (D)   Reduction in surety for projects that require plat recording. The
surety may be reduced in accordance with the following.
      (1)   First reduction. The city will conduct an inspection 30 days after
the plat is recorded. At that time, the surety may be reduced by an amount
equal to the punch list items that have been completed.
      (2)   Second reduction. One year after the plat is recorded, the surety
may be reduced by an amount equal to the punch list items that have been
completed and reduced by 10% of the total cost of the stormwater facilities.
      (3)   Third reduction. Two years after the plat is recorded, the surety
may be reduced by an amount equal to the punch list items that have been
completed. If the final surface course has been applied for at least one year,
then the surety may also be reduced by an amount equal to 10% of the total cost
of the final course of asphalt.
      (4)   Fourth reduction. Three years after the plat is recorded, the
surety may be reduced by an amount equal to the punch list items that have been
completed and reduced by 10% of the total cost of the sanitary sewer
facilities. If the final surface course has been applied for at least one year,
then the surety may also be reduced by an amount equal to 10% of the total cost
of the final course of asphalt (if it has not been previously reduced).
   (E)   Reduction in surety for projects that do not involve plat recording.
The surety may be reduced in accordance with the following.
      (1)   First reduction. The city will conduct an inspection 30 days after
the date of substantial completion. At that time, the surety may be reduced by
an amount equal to the punch list items that have been completed.
      (2)   Second reduction. One year after the date of substantial
completion, the surety may be reduced by an amount equal to the punch list
items that have been completed and reduced by 10% of the total cost of the
stormwater facilities.
      (3)   Third reduction. Two years after the date of substantial
completion, the surety may be reduced by an amount equal to the punch list
items that have been completed. If the final surface course has been applied
for at least one year, then the surety may also be reduced by an amount equal
to 10% of the total cost of the final course of asphalt.
      (4)   Fourth reduction. Three years after the date of substantial
completion, the surety may be reduced by an amount equal to the punch list
items that have been completed and reduced by 10% of the total cost of the
sanitary sewer facilities. If the final surface course has been applied for at
least one year, then the surety may also be reduced by an amount equal to 10%
of the total cost of the final course of asphalt (if it has not been previously
reduced).

§ 51.065 SPECIAL INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Pursuant to the requirements imposed on publicly owned wastewater
treatment works by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,
being 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq. and later amendments, all pretreatment
standards promulgated by the U.S. EPA for new and existing industrial
discharges to public sewer systems are hereby made a part of this chapter. Any
industrial waste discharge which violates these EPA pretreatment standards
shall be in violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, the industry shall be solely responsible for
the continued maintenance in satisfactory and effective operation of such
facilities and at their expense.
   (C)   (1)   Any person who transports septic tank, seepage pit, or cesspool
contents, liquid industrial waste or other batch liquid waste, and wishes to
discharge such waste to the public sewer system shall first have a valid
special waste hauler’s permit. Applications for permits shall be obtained from
the pretreatment coordinator. All applicants for a special waste hauler’s
permit shall complete the application form, pay the appropriate fee, and
receive a copy of the city’s regulations governing discharge to sewers of
liquid wastes from trucks. All persons receiving such permits shall agree, by
acceptance of the permit, to abide by all applicable provisions of this
chapter, and any other special provisions that may be established by the city
as necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the sewerage system.
      (2)   In addition, any person holding a valid permit and wishing to
discharge to the wastewater treatment plant must submit to the WWTP plant
manager a sample of each load prior to discharge. A fee and payment schedule
shall be established in the permit to cover cost of the required analysis. The
pretreatment coordinator may require proof of origin of the hauled waste and
analysis of the sample prior to discharge.
      (3)   It shall be illegal to discharge any batch liquid waste into any
manhole or other part of the public sewer system, or any building sewer or
other facility that discharges to the public sewer system, except at designated
points of discharge specified by the city for such purpose.
      (4)   Any liquid waste hauler illegally discharging to the public sewer
system or discharging wastewater not authorized in the permit shall be subject
to immediate revocation of discharge privileges and further subject to the
penalties and enforcement actions prescribed in §
51.999 including fines and imprisonment.
      (5)   Waste haulers who have been granted permission to discharge to the
public sewer system shall pay fees for such discharge in accordance with a fee
schedule established by the WWTP plant manager and approved by the city.
      (6)   Nothing in this chapter shall relieve waste haulers of the
responsibility for compliance with Bell County Health Department, state, or
federal regulations.

§ 51.066 PROTECTION FROM ACCIDENTAL AND SLUG DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Protection.
      (1)   Each significant user shall provide protection from accidental and/
or slug discharges of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this chapter which adversely affect the POTW. Facilities to prevent accidental
and/or slug discharges of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the owner or user’s own cost and expense. All significant industrial users
are required to notify the WWTP plant manager immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. Once every two years,
the pretreatment coordinator will determine whether each industrial user needs
to develop or update a plan to control slug discharges. If the pretreatment
coordinator determines that a slug control plan or revision is necessary, the
plan shall contain the following:
         (a)   Description of discharge practices;
         (b)   Description of stored chemicals;
         (c)   Procedures for notifying POTW; and
         (d)   Prevention procedures for spills.
      (2)   In the case of all possible or actual accidental and/or slug
discharges, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and
notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
   (B)   Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge,
the user shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as
a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter, the
enforcement response plan or other applicable law.
   (C)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.

§ 51.084 ALTERNATIVE DISCHARGE LIMITS.
   (A)   Where an effluent from a categorical industrial process(es) is mixed
prior to treatment with wastewater other than that generated by the regulated
process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge
permit by the pretreatment coordinator. These alternative limits shall be
applied to the mixed effluent and shall be calculated using the combined
wastestream formula and/or flow-weighted average formula as defined in §
51.002.
   (B)   Where the effluent limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production
(production-based standard), the pretreatment coordinator may convert the
limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant
discharged per day or of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent permit limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be
subject to all permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 C.F.R. § 403.6
(c) and must fully comply with these alternative limits.
   (C)   All categorical users subject to production-based standards must
report production rates annually so that alternative permit limits can be
calculated if necessary. The categorical user must notify the pretreatment
coordinator 30 days in advance of any major change in production levels that
will affect the limits for the discharge permit.
(Prior Code, § 51.079) (Ord. FY 20-21, #3, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.085 PERMIT DURATION.
   Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five
years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a year or may be stated to
expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum
of 60 days prior to the expiration of the user’s existing permit. The terms and
conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the city during the
term of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in §§
51.060 through
51.069 are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of
any proposed changes in their permit at least 30 days prior to the effective
date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a
reasonable time schedule for compliance.
(Prior Code, § 51.080) (Ord. FY 91-92, #29, passed 7-2-1991; Ord. FY 20-21, #3,

§ 51.086 PERMIT TRANSFER.
   Industrial user permits are issued to a specific user for a specific
operation. An industrial user permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or
sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed
operation without a 30 day prior notification to the pretreatment coordinator
and provision of a copy of the existing permit to the new owner. The
pretreatment coordinator may deny the transfer of the permit if it is deemed
necessary.
(Prior Code, § 51.081) (Ord. FY 20-21, #3, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.087 COMPLIANCE DATA REPORTING.
   (A)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new user, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to federal categorical pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit, to
the pretreatment coordinator, a report indicating the nature and concentration
of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited
by categorical pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and
maximum daily flow for these process units in the user’s facility which are
limited by such categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. The report
shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or
requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional
pretreatment and time schedule is necessary to bring the user into compliance
with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user.
   (B)   Where compliance schedules are required, the following conditions
shall apply:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; and
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the pretreatment
coordinator no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule.

passed 11-1-2011; Ord. FY 20-21, #3, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.088 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   The pretreatment coordinator may require significant industrial users
to submit at least once every six months, unless required more frequently by
the industrial user permit (or on dates specified in the industrial user
permit), a report indicating, at a minimum, the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards or
the discharge permit. The report shall also include the chain-of-custody (COC)
forms, field data, and any other information required by the Superintendent. In
addition, the pretreatment coordinator may require the submittal on the report
of a record of all daily flows. At the discretion of the pretreatment
coordinator and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow
rates, holidays, budget cycles, and the like, the pretreatment coordinator may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
40 C.F.R. part 403.12 and §
51.096.
   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge. All analyses shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to
the city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures
established by the U.S. EPA Administrator pursuant to § 304(g) of the Act and
contained in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and amendments thereto and 40 C.F.R. part 261
or with any other test procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the
U.S. EPA Administrator. Except as indicated in divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of
this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Superintendent. Where time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
Superintendent, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. part 136
and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited
in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
composting procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Superintendent as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may
be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
      (1)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (2)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four
grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data
are available, the Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial user is
required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (C)   Where 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant(s) in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication,
Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
   (D)   A baseline monitoring report (BMR) must be submitted to the
pretreatment coordinator by all categorical industrial users at least 90 days
prior to initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. Submittal of the permit
application required by the city shall also satisfy this requirement. The BMR
or permit application must contain, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Production data. A process description, SIC code number, raw
materials used, chemicals used, final product, pretreatment industrial category
(if applicable), and a schematic which indicates points of discharge to the
sewer system;
      (2)   Identifying information. Identifying information to include name,
address of facility, owner(s), contact person, and any other permits held by
the facility;
      (3)   Wastewater characteristics. Total plant flow, types of discharges,
average and maximum flows from each process;
      (4)   Nature/concentration of pollutants. Analytical results for all
pollutants regulated by this chapter and/or any applicable federal pretreatment
standard and sample type and location. All analyses must conform with 40 C.F.R.
part 136 and amendments thereto;

pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements;
and
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in §
51.080.
   (E)   New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in
divisions (D)(3) and (D)(4) of this section, but at no time shall a new source
commence discharge(s) to the public sewer of substances that do not meet
provisions of this chapter. All new sources must be in compliance with all
provisions of this chapter, state and federal pretreatment regulations prior to
commencement of discharge to the public sewer.
   (F)   Compliance schedule progress reports: the following conditions shall
apply to all compliance schedules required by this chapter:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards;
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; and
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no
later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and in no event
shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the
Superintendent.
   (G)   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with best management practices as may be required.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for
a period of at least three years. This period shall automatically be extended
for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city or where the
user has been specifically notified of a longer retention by the
Superintendent.
   (H)   (1)   The Superintendent may reduce the requirement for periodic
compliance reports to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a
year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the
U.S. EPA or the state, where the industrial user’s total categorical wastewater
flow does not exceed any of the following:
         (a)   Five thousand gallons per day or 0.01% of the WWTP’s dry-weather
design hydraulic capacity, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous
flow monitoring device unless the user discharges in batches;
         (b)   0.01% of the design dry-weather organic treatment capacity of
the WWTP; and
         (c)   0.01% of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any
pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for
which approved local limits were developed in accordance with §§
51.060 through
51.069.
      (2)   Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in
the last two years been in significant noncompliance as defined in §
51.094. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an industrial user
with daily flow rates, production levels or pollutant levels that vary so
significantly that, in the opinion of the Superintendent, decreasing the
reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are
not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.

§ 51.090 MONITORING.
   (A)   (1)   The city shall require significant industrial users to provide
and operate, at the user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or
internal drainage system. The monitoring facility should normally be situated
on the user’s premises, but the city may, when such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in a public right-of-way. The pretreatment coordinator shall review
and approve the location, plans, and specifications for such monitoring
facilities and may require them to be constructed to provide for the separate
monitoring and sampling of industrial waste and sanitary sewage flows.
      (2)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility shall be designed and maintained in a manner such that the safety
of city and industrial personnel shall be foremost. The facility, sampling, and
measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a proper operating
condition at the expense of the user.
      (3)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
approval of the location, plans and specifications.
   (B)   All sampling analyses done in accordance with approved federal EPA
procedures by the industrial user during a reporting period, as required by the
user’s industrial user permit or by the city, shall be submitted to the
pretreatment coordinator.
   (C)   The industrial user must receive the approval of the pretreatment
coordinator before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring facilities to
be used in all required sampling.
(Prior Code, § 51.085) (Ord. FY 91-92, #29, passed 7-2-1991; Ord. FY 20-21, #3,
passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.091 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The pretreatment coordinator shall inspect the facilities of any user
to ascertain whether the purposes of this chapter are being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the pretreatment coordinator or
his or her representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, copying records, records
examination, or in the performance of any of their duties.
   (B)   The city, approval authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, approval authority, and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
(Prior Code, § 51.086) (Ord. FY 91-92, #29, passed 7-2-1991; Ord. FY 20-21, #3,

§ 51.092 PRETREATMENT.
   All significant industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this chapter and achieve compliance with
any applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time
limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. The city may
require the development of a compliance schedule for installation of
pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any industrial user that cannot
meet discharge limits required by this chapter. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level required by this chapter shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
pretreatment coordinator for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an effluent that complies with the provisions
of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to
the user’s initiation of the changes.

§ 51.093 ANNUAL PUBLICATION.
   (A)   The city shall annually publish in the largest newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW a list of significant users which were in significant
noncompliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards. The notification
shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during
the same 12 months.
   (B)   All records relating to the city’s pretreatment program shall be made
available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request. All
records shall be maintained for a minimum of three years in accordance with 40
C.F.R. § 403.12(O)(2).

   A user is defined as being in significant noncompliance when it commits one
or more of the following conditions:
   (A)   Causes imminent endangerment to human health or the environment or
results in the exercise of emergency authority under 40 C.F.R. part 403 to halt
or prevent such a discharge;
   (B)   Involves failure to report noncompliance accurately;
   (C)   Results in a chronic violation defined here as 66% or more of all
measurements taken during a six-month period that exceed (by any magnitude) the
daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter;
   (D)   Results in a technical review criteria (TRC) violation defined here as
33% or more of all measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a
six-month period that equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or
the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS,
fats, and O&G and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH). For pH violations,
see the definition in §
51.002;
   (E)   Any violation of a pretreatment effluent limit that the pretreatment

ENFORCEMENT
§ 51.140 GENERAL.
   (A)   The city, through the pretreatment coordinator or his or her designee,
to ensure compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40 C.F.R.
Subchapter N, and 401 KAR 5:055, may take the following enforcement steps
against users in noncompliance with the chapter. The remedies available to the
POTW include injunctive relief, administrative, civil and criminal penalties,
immediate discontinuance of discharges and/or water service, and the publishing
of the list of significant violators annually. The enforcement authority shall
be vested in the pretreatment coordinator or his or her designee.
   (B)   The pretreatment coordinator may suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or an industrial user permit when such suspension is necessary, in
the opinion of the pretreatment coordinator, in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes
interference to the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its
NPDES/KPDES permit.
   (C)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the industrial user permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection and/or water service to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The city may reinstate the industrial user permit and/or the
wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying
discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence shall be submitted to the city within 15 days of the date of
occurrence.
(Prior Code, § 51.125) (Ord. FY 91-92, #29, passed 7-2-1991; Ord. FY 20-21, #3,
passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.141 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Any user found to be violating any provisions of this chapter,
wastewater permit, or any order issued hereunder, shall be served by the city
with written notice stating the nature of the violation(s). Within ten days of
the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of potential liability for
any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   If the violations persist or the explanation and/or plan are not
adequate, the city’s response shall be more formal and commitments (or
schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in an enforceable
document. The enforcement response selected will be related to the seriousness
of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if compliance is not
achieved expeditiously after the initial action. Identification of significant
noncompliance as defined in §
51.094 will require a formal enforcement action.
   (C)   The full scale of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the
city’s enforcement response plan.
(Prior Code, § 51.126) (Ord. FY 20-21, #3, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 51.142 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS.
   (A)   Any user discharging in violation of this chapter or other
pretreatment standards or requirements or is determined to be a chronic or
persistent violator or who is determined to be in significant noncompliance,
shall be ordered to appear before the city. At the appearance, an
administrative order may be given to the nonconforming user and an
administrative fine assessed. The fine shall be determined on a case-by-case
basis but consistent with the enforcement response plan. The pretreatment
coordinator shall consider the type and severity of violations, duration of
violation, number of violations, severity of impact on the POTW, impact on
human health, users economic benefit from violation, history of violations,
good faith of the user, and shall be a non-arbitrary but appropriate amount.
   (B)   The administrative order may take any of the following three forms.
      (1)   Consent orders. The pretreatment coordinator or his or her designee
is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the
industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include
specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the
same force and effect as orders issued pursuant to §
51.144.
      (2)   Compliance orders. When the pretreatment coordinator or his or her
designee finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the
chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder, he or she may issue an order to
the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been
installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other
requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology,
additional monitoring, and best management practices.
      (3)   Cease and desist orders. When the pretreatment coordinator finds
that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or
any permit or order issued hereunder, the pretreatment coordinator may issue an
order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in
noncompliance to:
         (a)   Comply forthwith; or
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
      (4)   Show cause hearing.
         (a)   The pretreatment coordinator or his or her designee may issue to
any user who causes or contributes to violations of this chapter, wastewater
permit or order issued hereunder, an order to appear and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the
pretreatment coordinator regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is
to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show
cause, before the pretreatment coordinator, why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days
before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of the
industrial user. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user or its
representative appears, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
         (b)   The city may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence,
or designate a representative to:
            1.   Issue, in the name of the city, notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in such hearing;
            2.   Take the evidence; and/or
            3.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city for
action thereon.
         (c)   At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony may be
taken under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded,
will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing
upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
         (d)   After the city has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order
to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified
time period, the sewer service will be discontinued unless adequate treatment

company, developer, or any other entity has violated a prohibition or failed to
meet a requirement of this subchapter, the issuing authority may order
compliance by written notice of violation NOV to the responsible entity as the
first level of enforcement, which does not include a penalty, or fine. An
offense of the same nature as the previous offense, even if previously
corrected under a notice of violation (NOV), will constitute a second offense
that may be enforced through a stop work order (SWO), which will be issued by
the issuing authority.
   (B)   A NOV and/or SWO may be posted for the entire project or any specified
part thereof if any of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   Any land disturbance activity not regulated by permit but has
runoff creating erosion;
      (2)   Any land disturbance activity regulated under this subchapter that
is being undertaken without a permit;
      (3)   The SWPPP is not being fully implemented; and
      (4)   Any of the conditions of the land disturbance permit are not being
met.
   (C)   For the purposes of this section, a NOV and/or SWO is official by
posting a copy of the NOV and/or SWO on the site of the land disturbing
activity in reasonable proximity to a location where the land disturbing
activity is taking place. Additionally, a copy of the violation and/or order,
in the case of work for which there is a land disturbance permit, shall be
mailed by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to the address listed by the
permittee on the permit. In the case of work for which there is no permit, a
copy of the violation and/or order shall be mailed to the person listed as the
landowner of the property.
   (D)   NOVs are the first level of enforcement and do not include a penalty,
or fine. Only one NOV will be issued for an offense before SWOs are utilized.
An offense of the same nature as a previous offense, even if previously
corrected under a NOV, will constitute a second offense to be enforced through
a SWO. Offenses enforced through a NOV must be corrected within five calendar
days of the date of issuance or a SWO may be issued.
   (E)   Stop work orders may include a penalty, or fine, for each occurrence
and payable to the city prior to release:
      (1)   First SWO: $250 fine; and
      (2)   Second SWO: $500 fine and permit revocation.
   (F)   If the permittee does not cease the activity or comply with the SWO
conditions within five calendar days, the city may revoke the permit.
   (G)   Upon revocation of permit, the permittee shall bring the site back
into compliance prior to re-inspection by the issuing authority. If the site is
found acceptable, the issuing authority will reinstate the permit upon receipt
permit application fees.
   (H)   (1)   For violations where no land disturbance permit has been issued,
the issuing authority will notify the responsible party and cooperate for
resolution prior to enforcement.
      (2)   Should the responsible party not cease the land disturbance
activity or demonstrate a history of noncompliance of the same nature, the
issuing authority may request the City Attorney to seek to obtain injunctive
relief.
   (I)   (1)   Six calendar days after posting a stop-work order, the city may
issue a notice of intent to the permittee, landowner, or land user stating the
city’s intent to perform work necessary to comply with subchapter.
      (2)   The city may go on the land and commence work after 14 days from
issuing the notice of intent. The costs incurred by the city to perform this
work shall be paid by the landowner or permittee out of the fiscal surety
referred to in this subchapter, to the extent that the amount is covered
thereby, with the remainder being directly due and owed by the landowner or
permittee.
      (3)   In the event no land disturbance permit was issued or no bond was
posted, the cost, plus interest at the rate authorized by the city, plus a
reasonable administrative and attorney fee shall be billed to the owner.
Failure to reimburse the city within 30 days will result in a lien being placed
on the property.
   (J)   Compliance with the provisions of this subchapter may also be enforced
by injunction.
   (K)   The issuing authority is authorized to require immediate abatement of
any violation of this subchapter that constitutes an immediate threat to the
health, safety, or well-being of the public. If any such violation is not
abated immediately, the city is authorized to enter onto private or public
property and to take any and all measures required to remediate the violation.
Any expense related to such remediation undertaken by the city shall be fully
reimbursed by the property owner and/or responsible party. The cost, plus
interest at the rate authorized by the city, plus a reasonable administrative
and attorney fee shall be billed to the owner. Failure to reimburse the city
within 30 days of notice will result in a lien being placed on the property.

§ 70.38 LIMITATION OF COLORED LIGHTS USED IN TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNALS; RULES FOR
VEHICULAR AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC CONTROLLED BY TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend or symbolic message, and
said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as
follows.
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at that place prohibits
either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. The vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a
turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
      (4)   Vehicular traffic that entered an intersection on a circular green
or yellow indication is allowed to complete a left turn during the red
indication.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian-control signal, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no
pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection, and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown,
except as follows.
         (a)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by this
division (C) with the intention of making a right turn, may make such right
turn, after stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such
movement, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic
lawfully proceeding through the intersection.
         (b)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by this
division (C) whose vehicle is in the left lane of a one-way highway with the
intention of making a left turn onto the left lane of another one-way highway
with the flow of traffic, may make such left turn, after stopping, unless an
official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding through the
intersection.
         (c)   In instances where there are two right of left lanes, an
allowable turn under this division (C) may be made from either lane unless a
regulatory sign specifically prohibits it.
      (2)   The city may, by ordinance, and the Bureau of Highways may, by
regulation, prohibit any right turn against a steady red signal at any
intersection, which prohibition shall be effective when an official sign
prohibiting such movement is erected at the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
   (D)   Applicable provisions. In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (E)   Obedience by vehicular traffic. Whenever an illuminated flashing red
or yellow light is used in a traffic signal or with a traffic sign it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows.
      (1)   Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with
rapid intermittent flashes, operators of vehicles shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side
of the intersection or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting
roadway where the operator has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering it, and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, operators of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   (F)   Motorcycle operation. Any person operating a motorcycle who violates
division (C) of this section by entering or crossing an intersection controlled
by a traffic-control signal against a steady red light shall have an
affirmative defense to that charge if the person establishes all of the
following conditions:
      (1)   The motorcycle was brought to a complete stop;
      (2)   The traffic-control signal continued to show a steady red light for
120 seconds or the traffic-control signal at the intersection has completed two
lighting cycles;
      (3)   The traffic-control signal was apparently malfunctioning or, if
programmed or engineered to change to a green light only after detecting the
approach of a motor vehicle, the signal apparently failed to detect the arrival
of a motorcycle; and
      (4)   No motor vehicle or person was approaching on the street or highway
to be crossed or entered, or any approaching person or vehicle was so far away
from the intersection that it did not constitute an immediate hazard.
   (G)   Affirmative defense. The affirmative defense outlined in division (F)
of this section shall only apply to a violation for entering or crossing an
intersection controlled by a traffic signal against a steady red light and
shall not provide a defense to any other civil or criminal action.
   (H)   Immunity. In the event a motorcyclist exercises the affirmative
defense provisions set forth in division (F) of this section, the
Transportation Cabinet or its employee are specifically immune from any and all
civil liability arising from any such claim, lawsuit, or dispute. Any claim,
lawsuit, or dispute against the Transportation Cabinet as a result of the
affirmative defense set forth in division (F) of this section, shall be brought
using the provisions outlined in KRS Chapter 44.

(KRS 189.290) (Prior Code, § 71.01) Penalty, see §
70.99(C)
§ 71.002 VEHICLES TO KEEP TO THE RIGHT.
   (A)   The operator of any vehicle when upon a highway shall travel upon the
right side of the highway whenever possible, and unless the left side of the
highway is clear of all other traffic or obstructions for a sufficient distance
ahead to permit the overtaking and passing of another vehicle to be completed
without interfering with the operation of any vehicle approaching from the
opposing direction or any vehicle being overtaken. The overtaking vehicle shall
return to the proper traffic lane as soon as practicable and, if the passing
vehicle enters the oncoming traffic lane, before coming within 200 feet of
approaching vehicle and presents a clear vision for a distance of at least 150
feet ahead.
   (B)   The operator of any vehicle moving slowly upon a highway shall keep
his or her vehicle as closely as practicable to the right-hand boundary of the
highway, allowing more swiftly moving vehicles reasonable free passage to the
left, unless signage or markings indicate otherwise.
(KRS 189.300) (Prior Code, § 71.02) Penalty, see §
70.99(C)
§ 71.003 VEHICLES MEETING OTHER VEHICLES AND ANIMALS.

   (B)   Vehicles proceeding from opposite directions shall pass each other
from the right, each giving to the other one-half of the highway as early as
possible.
   (C)   Every person operating a vehicle on a highway and approaching any
animal being ridden or driven, shall exercise every reasonable precaution to
prevent frightening the animal and to ensure the safety of the person riding or
driving it.
(KRS 189.310) (Prior Code, § 71.03) Penalty, see §
70.99(C)
§ 71.004 TURNING; RIGHT-OF-WAY AT INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   When two vehicles approach or enter an intersection from different
roadways at approximately the same time, the operator of the vehicle on the
left shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right.
   (B)   The right-of-way rule declared in division (A) of this section is
modified at highways and through intersections and as otherwise stated in this
chapter.
   (C)   Preferential right-of-way may be indicated by stop signs or yield
signs. The State Highway Commissioner with reference to state highways and
local authorities with reference to other highways under their jurisdiction may
designate any intersection as a stop intersection or as a yield intersection
and erect stop signs or yield signs at one or more entrances to such
intersections.
   (D)   Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, every operator of
a vehicle approaching a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but
if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection,
or, if none, than at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the
operator has view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before
entering it. After having stopped, the operator shall yield the right-of-way to
any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as
to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such operator is moving
across or within the intersection or junction of roadways.
   (E)   The operator of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall in obedience
to such sign slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and,
if required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but
if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection,
or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the
operator has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before
entering it. After slowing and stopping, the operator shall yield the right-of-
way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so
closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such operator is
moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways. However, if
the operator is involved in a collision with a vehicle in the intersection or
junction of roadways after driving past a yield sign without stopping, the
collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his or her failure to yield
the right-of-way.
   (F)   The operator of a vehicle intending to turn shall do so as follows:
      (1)   Right turns. Both the approach for a right turn and a right turn
shall be made as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the
roadway; and
      (2)   Left turns. The operator of a vehicle intending to turn left shall
approach the turn in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic
moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle. Whenever practicable the
left turn shall be made to the left of the center of the intersection and so as
to leave the intersection or other location in the extreme right-hand lane
lawfully available to traffic moving in the same direction as such vehicle on
the roadway being entered.
   (G)   The Department of Transportation and local authorities in their
respective jurisdictions may cause official traffic-control devices to be
placed and thereby require and direct that a different course from that
specified in this section be traveled by turning vehicles and when such devices
are so placed no operator shall turn a vehicle other than as directed and
required by such devices.
   (H)   The operator of any vehicle shall not turn the vehicle so as to
proceed in the opposite direction unless the movement can be made in safety
without interfering with other traffic.
   (I)   The operator of a vehicle intending to turn to the left within an
intersection or into an alley, private road, or driveway shall yield the right-
of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within
the intersection or so close thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
   (J)   The operator of a vehicle about to enter or cross a roadway from any
place other than another roadway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles
approaching on the roadway to be entered or crossed.
   (K)   On highways with a center lane restricted for left turns off the
highway by vehicles proceeding in both directions:
      (1)   A left turn shall not be made from any other lane; and
      (2)   A vehicle shall not be driven in a center lane as described in this
division (K) except when preparing for or making a left turn off the highway or
merging onto the highway after making a left turn from a side road or other
entrance.
(KRS 189.330) (Prior Code, § 71.04) Penalty, see §
70.99(C)
§ 71.005 OVERTAKING VEHICLES; TRAFFIC LANES; FOLLOWING VEHICLES.
   (A)   Vehicles overtaking other vehicles proceeding in the same direction
shall pass to the left of them and shall not again drive to the right until
reasonably clear of those vehicles. Vehicles overtaking streetcars may pass
either to the right or left when so directed by a police officer, when on a
one-way street, or where the location of the tracks prevents compliance with
this section, with regard for other traffic.
   (B)   (1)   Vehicles overtaking a bicycle or electric low-speed scooter
proceeding in the same direction shall:
         (a)   If there is more than one lane for traffic proceeding in the
same direction, move the vehicle to the immediate left, if the lane is
available and moving in the lane is reasonably safe; or
         (b)   If there is only one lane for traffic proceeding in the same
direction, pass to the left of the bicycle at a distance of not less than three
feet between any portion of the vehicle and the bicycle or electric low-speed
scooter and maintain that distance until safely past the overtaken bicycle. If
space on the roadway is not available to have a minimum distance of three feet
between the vehicle and the bicycle or electric low-speed scooter, then the
driver of the passing vehicle shall use reasonable caution in passing the
bicyclist or electric low-speed scooter operator.
      (2)   The driver of a motor vehicle may drive to the left of the center
of a roadway, including when a no-passing zone is marked in accordance with
division (F) of this section, to pass a person operating a bicycle or electric
low-speed scooter only if the roadway to the left of the center is unobstructed
for a sufficient distance to permit the driver to pass the person operating the
bicycle or electric low-speed scooter safely and avoid interference with
oncoming traffic. This division (B) does not authorize driving on the left side
of the center of the roadway when otherwise prohibited under state law.
      (3)   The operator of a bicycle or electric low-speed scooter shall not
ride more than two abreast on a single highway lane unless operating on any
part of the roadway marked exclusively for bicycle use. Persons riding two
abreast shall not impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.
   (C)   The operator of a vehicle may overtake and pass upon the right of
another vehicle only under the following conditions:
      (1)   When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn;
or
      (2)   Upon a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for
two or more lines of vehicle moving lawfully in the direction being traveled by
the overtaking vehicle.
   (D)   The operator of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon
the right only under conditions permitting such movements in safety. Such
movement shall not be made by driving off the roadway unless the passing
vehicle comes to a complete stop and such movement may be made safely.
   (E)   No vehicle shall be driven to the left side of the center of the
roadway in overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction unless the left side is clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic
for a sufficient distance ahead to permit overtaking and passing to be
completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any vehicle
approaching from the opposite direction or any vehicle overtaken. In every
event the overtaking vehicle must return to the right-hand side of the roadway,
before coming within 200 feet of any vehicle approaching from the opposite
direction.
   (F)   The Chief of Police is authorized to determine those portions of any
highway where overtaking and passing or driving to the left of the roadway
would be especially hazardous and may by appropriate signs or markings on the
roadway indicate the beginning and end of the zones, and when the signs or
markings are in place and clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person,
every driver of a vehicle shall obey the directions thereof, except as provided
for in division (B)(2) of this section.
   (G)   Whenever any roadway has been divided into three clearly marked lanes
for travel the following additional rules shall apply.
      (1)   A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as may be practical entirely
within a single lane and shall not be moved from that lane until the driver has
first ascertained that the movement can be made with safety.
      (2)   A vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane except when
overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly visible and
the center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation
for a left turn, or where a center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to
traffic moving in the direction in which the vehicle is proceeding and is
signposted to give notice of the allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing slow-moving traffic to use
a designated lane or allocating specified lanes to traffic moving in the same
direction and operators of vehicles shall obey the directions of the signs.
   (H)   A vehicle shall not be driven in the left lane of any limited access
highway of four lanes or more with a posted speed limit of at least 65 mph
except in overtaking a slower vehicle, yielding to traffic coming onto such a
highway, or when traffic conditions exist which would prohibit safe use of the
right or center lanes.
   (I)   (1)   Except as provided in division (I)(3) of this section, the
operator of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than
is reasonable and prudent, having regard for the speed of the vehicle and the
traffic upon and condition of the highway.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (I)(3) of this section, the operator
of any motor truck, semitrailer truck, bus, or heavy construction equipment
unit when traveling upon a highway outside of a business or residential
district shall not follow within 250 feet of another vehicle or equipment unit.
This division (I) shall not prevent overtaking and passing, nor shall it apply
to any lane specially designated for use of motor trucks or semitrailer trucks,
buses, or heavy construction equipment units.
      (3)   Divisions (I)(1) and (I)(2) of this section shall not apply to a
trailing commercial motor vehicle involved in a platoon as defined in KRS
281.010, but shall apply to the commercial motor vehicle leading a platoon.
(KRS 189.340) (Prior Code, § 71.05) Penalty, see §
70.99(C)

   (A)   The operator of a vehicle about to be overtaken and passed shall give
way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle, upon audible signal being
given by the overtaking vehicle, if the overtaking vehicle is a motor vehicle
or bicycle.
   (B)   In all cases of meeting, passing, or overtaking of vehicle such
assistance shall be given by the operator and occupants of each vehicle,
respectively, to the other as the circumstances reasonably demand, in order to
obtain clearance and avoid accidents.

(Prior Code, § 110.02) (Minute book AA, page 47, passed 12-13-1974; Minute book

§ 110.04 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   Every person whose earnings or net profits are subject to the license
fee by this chapter, shall prepare and file a license fee return with the
Director of Finance within the time periods specified herein, outlining the
compensation received or net profits earned subject to the license fee with
computation of the amount of the fee owed to the city.
   (B)   For all license fee payers to whom the net profits basis for
determining the license fee applies, the following divisions shall be
applicable:
      (1)   For a license fee payer who derives all net profits from activities
outside the city, the license fee shall be computed on the basis of the license
fee payer’s average annual number of employees as follows:
 
Employees   Fee
0—25      $250
26—50     $350
51—100    $500
100 or more $750
 
      (2)   (a)   For a license fee payer who derives his or her net profits
from activities both within and without the city, the percentage of gross
receipts from activities within the city must be first computed and multiplied
times the total net profits of the license fee payer to arrive at the net
profits subject to the license fee hereunder. The license fee payer shall be
liable for the fee as computed under this division (B)(2)(a) or the fee listed
under the average annual employer table of division (B)(1) of this section,
whichever is greater.
         (b)   Any license fee payer under division (B)(2)(a) of this section,
shall file, together with his or her license fee return, a statement, certified
under penalties of perjury by both the license fee payer and the preparer of
his or her return, that the percentage applied hereunder is a true and accurate
reflection of the business records of the license fee payer.
      (3)   For a license fee payer who derives all net profits from activities
within the city, the license fee payer shall compute his or her net profit as
defined in § 1100.01, subject to a minimum license fee of $50.
      (4)   Where an employer has withheld the license fee from the entire
earnings of an employee, it shall not be necessary for such employee to file a
license fee return unless directed to do so by the Director of Finance.
   (C)   If the return is made for a fiscal year or for any period other than a
calendar year, the return shall be made within 135 days from the end of the
fiscal year or other period.
   (D)   The person making the return shall, at the time of filing, pay to the
Treasurer the amount of fee shown to be due by the return.
   (E)   Where any portion of the license fee otherwise due shall have been
deducted at the source and shall have been paid to the Treasurer by the person
making the deduction, a credit equal to the amount so paid shall be deducted
from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and
payable at the time of filing of the return.
   (F)   If a licensee shall terminate his or her business or employment for
which the license fee has not been withheld during the calendar year or fiscal
year, the proper return shall be filed and the tax paid within 135 days after
termination of the business or employment.
   (G)   Persons temporarily engaged in business, as defined herein, within the
city of temporarily performing services within the city, shall file a return
and pay the license fee upon the completion of the business or employment.
(Prior Code, § 110.04) (Minute book AA, page 47, passed 12-13-1974; Minute book
AA, page 128, passed - -)
§ 110.05 COLLECTION OF LICENSE FEE AT SOURCE.
   (A)   It is the duty of each employer (as defined in §
110.01) who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission, or other
compensation basis, to deduct monthly or more often, at the time of the payment
of such compensation, the license fee on such salary, wage, bonus, incentive
payment, commission, or other compensation due by the employer to the employee.
The license fee shall be deducted by the employer from all compensation paid to
employees for activities in the city. However, the mere fact that the license
fee is not withheld will not relieve the employee of the responsibility of
filing a return and paying the fee on the compensation received. A nonresident
employer either maintaining an office, business address, or doing business or
who is otherwise subject to service of legal process is subject to the
withholding provisions of this section.
   (B)   Where an employee receives compensation for personal services rendered
or performed partly within and partly without the city, the withholding agent
shall deduct and withhold that portion of the compensation which is earned
within the city in accordance with the following rules of apportionment.
      (1)   If the licensee is a traveling salesman, agent, or other employee
whose compensation on the basis of commission depends directly on the volume of
business transacted by him or her, the deducting and withholding shall attach
to that portion of the entire compensation, which the volume of business
transacted by him or her within the city bears to the volume of business
transacted by him or her both within and without the city.
      (2)   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
all other employees (including officers of corporations), shall attach to that
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee, which the total
number of working days employed within the city bears to the total number of
working days employed within and without the city.
      (3)   If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above
because of the peculiar nature of the services of the employee, or group of
employees similarly or identically circumstanced, or of the unusual basis of
compensation, apportionment shall be made in accordance with the facts and the
fee deducted. The employer shall furnish the Director of Finance a detailed
statement of facts.
      (4)   The occasional entry into the city of an employee who performs the
duties for which he or she is employed entirely outside the city, but enters
the city for the purpose of reporting, receiving, instructing, or accounting
incidental to his or her duties outside the city, shall not be deemed to take
this employee out of the class of those rendering their service entirely
outside the city.
   (C)   An employer is required to withhold the license fee on the full amount
of any advances made to an employee on account of commissions where in excess
of commission earned.
   (D)   An employer required to withhold the license fee on compensation paid
to an employee may in determining the amount on which the fee is to be
withheld:
      (1)   Ignore any amount allowed and paid by the employer to the employee
for expenses necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual
performance of his or her services; or
      (2)   Deduct any amount necessarily incurred and expended by the employee
in the actual performance of his or her services, for which expense he or she
is not to be or has not been reimbursed by the employer; provided, that in
either case, such expense must be recognized by the federal and state
authorities for payroll tax purposes and the federal authorities for income tax
purposes, and the employee shall furnish the employer before the deduction is
made, an itemized statement of the expenses claimed.
   (E)   Such employer shall, however, on or before January 31 of each year,
furnish the Director of Finance a list of employees in such form as the
employer may choose, setting forth the following information in respect to the
preceding calendar year:
      (1)   Name;
      (2)   Address; and
      (3)   Gross wages paid.
(Prior Code, § 110.05) (Minute book AA, page 47, passed 12-13-1974)
§ 110.06 RETURNS OF LICENSE FEE WITHHELD AND PAYMENT.
   (A)   The return and payment required to be made on account of deductions by
employers from salaries, wages, and other compensation of employees shall be
made quarterly for the quarterly periods ending March 31, June 30, September
30, and December 31 of each year.
   (B)   The employer (in addition to any return required to be filed with
respect to his or her own earnings or net profits) shall, on or before the last
day of the month following each quarterly period, make a return and pay to the
Treasurer the full amount of the license fee so deducted or withheld with
respect to compensation paid all of his or her employees subject to the license
fee under this chapter. No part of such tax so withheld and so reported may be
paid to the Treasurer in installments.
   (C)   The return required to be filed under this section shall be made on a
form furnished by or obtainable from the Treasurer.
   (D)   On or before January 31, unless a written request for extension is
made to, and granted by the Director of Finance in the form prescribed by him
or her, an information return shall be made showing all employees from whom
city license fee have been withheld, giving the name and address of each
employee, the total amount of compensation paid during the year, and the amount
of city license fees withheld from such employees.
   (E)   In deducting and withholding the license fee at source and in the
payment of any fee under this chapter, a fractional part of a cent shall be
disregarded unless it amounts to one-half or more, in which case it shall be
increased to $0.01.
(Prior Code, § 110.06) (Minute book AA, page 47, passed 12-13-1974)
§ 110.07 IMPOSITION OF LICENSE FEE; EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Employees in general. The license fee is imposed on both residents and
nonresidents of the city at the rate of 2% of all salaries, wages, commissions,

in the city.
   (B)   Subject to license fees. The following are subject to the license fee:

         (f)   As an officer, agent, or employee of any other entity.
      (2)   Wages, bonuses, or incentive payments received by an individual,
whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in property for
services rendered:
         (a)   Whether based upon hourly, daily, weekly, semimonthly, monthly,
or annual unit of production of piece-work rates; and
         (b)   Whether paid by an individual, copartnership, association,
corporation (including a corporation of the first or non-profit class), a
governmental, administration, agency, arm, authority, board, body, branch,
bureau, department, division, section, or unit, or other entity.
      (3)   Commissions received by a taxpayer, whether directly or through an
agent and whether in case or in property, for services rendered regardless of
how computed or by whom paid. (If amounts received as a drawing account exceed
the commissions earned the tax is payable on the amounts received.) If such
commissions are included in the net earnings of a trade, business, or
profession regularly carried on by such individual, they shall not again be
separately taxed;
      (4)   (a)   Fees, unless such fees are properly included as part of the
net profits of trade, business, profession, or enterprise regularly carried on
by the individual; and
         (b)   Fees paid to a director or officer of a corporation are subject
to withholding under §
110.08 as in the case of any other employee.
      (5)   Other compensation which will be treated as subject to the license
fee:
         (a)   Tips received by waiters and others. Tips received are subject
to the license fee and will be reported in the same manner as earnings of an
independent contractor;
         (b)   Vacation and/or holiday benefits. Payments made to employees by
an employer as vacation wages are subject to the license fee; and
         (c)   Separation payments. Payments made to employees by an employer
at the time of a voluntary or involuntary separation (dismissal) of the
employee from the service of the employer, are to be regarded as subject to the

commissions and other compensations and net profits” within the meaning of this
chapter:
         (a)   Old age or retirement payments. Periodical payments, commonly

employment, together with any amount of damages received by suit or agreement
on account of such disability, are not subject to the license fee.
      (7)   Applicability of the foregoing regulations to employees whose
compensation is not wholly subject. In the case of individuals whose
compensation is earned for services performed both within and without the city
and who receive subject payments as set forth in the foregoing rules and
regulations, they are subject to the license fee in the same proportion that
services performed within the city bear to their total employment time.
(Prior Code, § 110.07) (Minute book AA, page 47, passed 12-13-1974)
§ 110.08 SPECIFIC GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Musicians and entertainers. In the field of professional musicians
there has arisen a practice peculiar to the engagement of musicians exclusively
through so-called “contractors”. The practice which arose by prescription by
the American Federation of Musicians and local union regulations, enables the
purchaser of music to deal with only one of the number of musicians required
for a particular occasion.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         (a)   CONTRACTOR. This term means that individual musician through
whom the purchaser and the musician negotiates the contract of service and the
performance thereof. The CONTRACTOR may or may not perform actual musical
service under a contract which he or she has negotiated.
         (b)   NAME BANDS OR ORCHESTRAS. This term means one which is
identified or known by a name and which holds itself out to the public as a
permanent organization, and in addition thereto has either: a fixed personnel;
or the individual member musician has contracted for his or her services with
the leader or the owner of the band at a fixed salary by term or by individual
engagement and over whom the purchaser has no direct control.
         (3)   PURCHASER OF MUSIC. The person, partnership, organization, or
association for whom or which the musical services are to be performed or
furnished and who exercises an employer’s control over the conduct of the
musicians. For example: hotels, cafés, taprooms, restaurants, theaters, clubs,
radio stations, and radio sponsors.
      (2)   When a contract for the purchase of music has been executed between
a purchaser and a contractor, the musician shall be deemed to be the employee
of the purchaser, except in the case of name bands, in which event the
musicians shall be deemed to be employees of the leader or owner of the name
band.
      (3)   The purchaser, and in the case of a name band, the leader or owner
thereof, shall be the person responsible for withholding the license fee from
the wages paid to the musicians, and the remittal thereof to the Treasurer.
      (4)   Entertainers other than musicians. An entertainer other than a
musician is usually engaged by a purchaser through a booking agent. The booking
agent, once the contract of employment has been executed, does not exercise an
employer’s control over the entertainer.
      (5)   The owner of a club, café, taproom, theater, or any place which
furnishes entertainment to the public or to its patrons, shall be deemed the
person liable as an employer of entertainers. Such employer must deduct the
license fee from the compensation paid to the entertainer and remit the same to
the Treasurer.
   (B)   Insurance companies.
      (1)   There is hereby imposed on each insurance company a license fee for
the privilege of engaging in the business of insurance within the corporate
limits of the city for the calendar year 1985, and thereafter on a calendar
year basis.
      (2)   The license fee imposed upon each insurance company which issues
life insurance policies on the lives of persons residing within the corporate
limits of the city shall be 2% of the first year’s premiums actually collected
within each calendar quarter by reason of the issuance of such policies.
      (3)   The license fee imposed upon each insurance company which issues
any insurance policy which is not a life insurance policy shall be 3% of the
premiums actually collected within each calendar quarter by reason of the
issuance of such policies on risks located within the corporate limits of the
city on those classes of business which such company is authorized to transact,
less all premiums returned to policy holders; however, any license fee or tax
imposed upon premium receipts shall not include premiums received for insuring
employers against liability for personal injuries to their employees, or death
caused thereby, under the provisions of the Worker’s Compensation Act and shall
not include premiums received on policies of group health insurance provided
for state employees under KRS 18A.225(2).
      (4)   All license fees imposed by this division (B) shall be due no later
than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. License fees which are not
paid on or before the due date shall bear interest at the tax interest rate as
defined in KRS 131.010(6).
      (5)   Every insurance company subject to the license fees imposed by this
division (B) shall annually, by March 31, furnish the city with a written
breakdown of all collections in the preceding calendar year for the following
categories of insurance:
         (a)   Casualty;
         (b)   Automobile;
         (c)   Inland marine;
         (d)   Fire and allied perils;
         (e)   Health; and
         (f)   Life.
   (C)   Railroad and train service employees.
      (1)   For railroad employees who perform all of their work within the
limits of the city, the license fee shall be measured by the proportionate
share of their gross earnings representing service within the city.
      (2)   Where such employees serve both within and without the city, the
license fee shall be measured by the proportionate share of their gross
earnings representing service within the city.
      (3)   Where the work of such employees is preponderantly outside the
city, the employee shall not be deemed to be engaged in a service within the
city.
      (4)   Officers and supervisory personnel whose headquarters are in the
city and whose occupations regularly require part of the work to be done
outside the city, shall be allowed to prorate the compensation on which a
license is due, for that part of the work done within the city. There shall be
no proration of compensation for employees’ headquarters within the city where
travel is only incidentally connected with the occupation. Individual cases of
claimed exemption under this division (C)(4) shall be subject to review by the
Director of Finance.
      (5)   No license shall be due on compensation of railroad employees for
sick leave.
      (6)   The fact that any particular railroad employee affected by the
foregoing regulations may be engaged in interstate commerce, is not relevant in
determining the subjectability of compensation received by him or her.
   (D)   Motor freight and commercial transportation other than railroads.
Since the circumstances involved in the employment of such employees are
substantially analogous to those of railroad train and engine service
employees, the set of regulations applicable thereto shall apply to employees
in the aforesaid category.
   (E)   Federal, state, or municipal employees.
      (1)   Compensation received from the federal government for services
performed within any federal reservation situated within the geographical
limits of the city, title to which is in the federal government, is subject
income, even though exclusive jurisdiction thereof was granted to the federal
government by the commonwealth and the city.
      (2)   Compensation received from state, county, and municipal
governmental agencies is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Refund of tax withheld and paid covering activities outside the
city will be made to employees upon application on a form provided by the
Finance Director.
   (F)   Real estate salesmen; brokers.
      (1)   Real estate salesmen or brokers who are engaged in the business as
employees rather than as independent contractors are not required to file a
return for the commissions earned by them. The employer is required to deduct
the fee from the commissions earned and remit the same to the Treasurer.
      (2)   Real estate salesmen or brokers acting as independent contractors
are subject to a license fee on their net profits in accordance with the rules
and regulations as provided for herein.
   (G)   Tailors. Tailors who receive work to perform in their own shops for a
specified amount to be paid for each garment are independent contractors.
   (H)   Nurses.
      (1)   A registered nurse (except as provided below) is in the same status
as any other professional person and is required to file a return upon her net
profits. He or she may deduct the actual expenses incurred from the earning of
his or her fees. Deductible items are expenses recognized as deductions by the
Internal Revenue Service and Department of Revenue.
      (2)   A registered nurse regularly employed by a hospital, institution,
business entity, or individual is subject to the withholding provisions of this
chapter.
   (I)   Executives and directors. An officer or director of a corporation
performing service out of the city except for occasional visits to the city
office to examine correspondence is not subject to the license fee. Where an
organization meets in the city, and part of the work required as officer or
director of such organization is done by him or her in the city, his or her
compensation is subject in the ratio that those duties bear to his or her total
duties.
   (J)   Domestic servants. Domestic servants employed in private homes are not
subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   (K)   Miscellaneous.
      (1)   Where compensation is received (paid) in property, its fair market
value, at the time of receipt, shall be subject to a license fee and to
withholding (deduction of fee at source). Board and lodging and similar items
shall be included in earnings at their fair market value, where such board and
lodging is considered part of the compensation paid. However, the value
accepted for the purpose of the state and federal payroll taxes may be accepted
by the Director of Finance.
      (2)   In the case of employees who incur and pay expenses directly
connected with performance of their duties or services and for which no
reimbursement is made by the employer, the reasonable actual expenses incurred
and paid in earning the compensation may be deducted in computing the amount
subject to the license fee. To be allowed, however, such expenses must be
recognized as deductions by the federal and state authorities for payroll tax
purposes.
      (3)   Such items as personal, family, or living expenses, expenses
commuting to and from work, old age benefits taxes, deductions for group
insurance, or hospitalization pension plans are not deductible as expenses
directly connected with the performance of service.

§ 110.10 PAYMENT OF LICENSE FEE; WITHHOLDING AND RETURN.
   (A)   Each employer who employs one or more persons within the city shall
deduct monthly, or more often, at the time of payment thereof, the license fee
due from each employee measured by the amount of salaries, wages, commissions,
or compensation due by the employer to the employee, and shall pay to the
Treasurer the amount of license fee so deducted. The payment required to be
made on account of deduction by employers shall be made quarterly, for the
quarterly periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, of
each year, on or before the last day of the month next following the quarter of
the deduction, to the Treasurer.
   (B)   The employer shall, annually during the month of January of each year,
make a return to the Director of Finance in which is set forth the name and
residence of each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar year,
giving the amount of salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensations
earned during such preceding year, by each employee. However, the failure or
omission of any employer to deduct such license fee in compliance with these
regulations with respect to making returns and payment thereof, as may be fixed
in this chapter or established by the Director of Finance.
   (C)   Each person subject to a license fee imposed by this chapter shall, on
or before May 15, following the close of each year, make and file with the
Director of Finance a return, in duplicate, on a form furnished by or obtained
from the Treasurer, setting forth the aggregate amount of salaries, wages,
commissions, and other compensations or net profits during the preceding year.
However, where the entire license due under this chapter has been withheld
under the provisions hereof, the Director of Finance may waive the filing of
the return by the licensee; provided, that where the fiscal year of the
business, profession, or other activity differs from the calendar year and the
licensee files federal income tax returns for such fiscal years, the license
tax shall be measured by the net profit of the fiscal year. In the case where
taxpayers have fiscal years ending June 30, and prior to December 31, such
taxpayers shall file their license tax reports on May 15, of the following year
and pay a license fee based upon the net profit for such fiscal year so ending.
Where the fiscal year ends after December 31, and prior to June 30, such
taxpayers shall file a tentative tax license return on May 15 of each year. For
those persons filing a tentative return a final return will be filed on May 15
after the ending of the fiscal year. Full credit can be taken for any amount
paid on the tentative return. It is the intent of this chapter that any license
fee paid hereunder during any calendar year is for the right to do business for
that calendar year.
   (D)   The Director of Finance shall have the authority to extend the filing
of the returns at his or her discretion. Such extension shall be upon the
written request of the licensee. However, any balance unpaid when payment is
due under the terms of this chapter shall bear interest at the rate of 7% per
annum until paid.
(Prior Code, § 110.10) (Minute book AA, page 47, passed 12-13-1974)
§ 110.11 DUTIES OF THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE.
   (A)   Duties. The Director of Finance is required:
      (1)   To collect and receive the license fee imposed under this chapter;
      (2)   To keep an accurate record showing the amount received from each
license payer and withholding employer;
      (3)   To pay over on a monthly basis to the City Treasurer, the gross
fees collected hereunder; and
      (4)   To enforce all provisions of this chapter and any rules and
regulations pertaining thereto.
   (B)   Regulations; rulings.
      (1)   Under the powers given the Director of Finance, these regulations
are issued. Additional regulations and rulings will be issued from time to time
as circumstances may demand.
      (2)   These regulations, together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and all changes therein, will be on file with the Director of Finance
of the city, and will be open to public inspection. Copies thereof will, so far
as possible, be available to all license payers, employers, and their
representatives upon request.
   (C)   Request from state. For the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any
return based on net profits for a specified period, the Director of Finance is
authorized and empowered to request from the Kentucky Department of Revenue the
amount of net profit listed by a license fee payer on his or her Kentucky state
income tax return for the corresponding period.
   (D)   Corresponding net profit figures. Corresponding net profit figures on
both the Kentucky state income tax return and the city net profit return shall
be prima facie evidence that the license fee payer has filed an accurate
return.
   (E)   Net profit figures vary. In the event that the net profit figures on
the respective returns vary, or in the event of mathematical errors in the city
returns, the Director of Finance may assess the license fee payer for any
deficiencies deemed due and owing, notifying the license fee payer by certified
letter of the tax due. The license fee payer shall have the right, within 30
days of the receipt of the notice, to file a written protest with the Director
of Finance. Within 30 days of the filing of the protest, the license fee payer
shall file with the Director of Finance a written statement, certified under
penalties of perjury, outlining the findings to which the license fee payer
takes exception and the grounds upon which the license fee payer relies. The
Director of Finance, upon receipt of the license fee payer’s written statement,
shall grant a conference to the license fee payer. Proceedings at the
conference shall be informal. The license fee payer may present evidence by
affidavit, witnesses, or oral or written testimony or argument. Within 30 days
of the conference, the Director of Finance shall notify the license fee payer
by certified mail of his or her decision and the amount, if any, of his or her
final deficiency assessment. Within 30 days of the receipt of the original
deficiency assessment, or upon completion of the protest and conference
procedures, and receipt of the final deficiency assessment, the license fee
payer shall pay any deficiency. The license fee payer may at this point file a
suit for refund or credit in a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (F)   Limitations on assessment in collection. The Director of Finance is
governed by the same period of limitations on assessment in collection as the
Kentucky Department of Revenue.
   (G)   Application for refund. An employee application for refund of
occupational taxes hereunder shall not be maintained unless filed with the
Director of Finance within one year of the closing of the taxable year upon
which the refund is based.

AA, page 128, passed - -)
§ 110.12 EMPLOYERS MUST KEEP ACCURATE RECORDS OF WITHHOLDINGS.
   (A)   Employers are required to keep such records as will enable the
Director of Finance to ascertain that proper amounts have been withheld from
employee earnings and an employee has filed a true and accurate license fee
return, and to make the same available to the Director of Finance upon his or
her written request.
   (B)   If the Director of Finance ascertains that either a return or the
amount of withholdings is incorrect, he or she may assess the license fee payer
and collect any deficiency in accordance with the procedures outlined for net
profit license fee payers under §
110.11(C).

§ 110.13 OVERPAYMENT OF LICENSE FEE; EMPLOYER REQUIRED TO PAY.
   (A)   Should it be disclosed, either as a result of an investigation by the
Director of Finance or through the medium of the filing of a claim or petition
for refund or credit, that an overpayment has been made, the city will refund
this overpayment.
   (B)   The employer will in every instance be required to pay the full
license fee which should have been withheld, even though he or she may fail to
withhold from the employee. If too much has been withheld, the excess shall be
refunded by the employer to the employee. While the withholding agent
(employer) will be expected to maintain complete records of such adjustments
with the employees, any such adjustment made during any month will not need to
be reflected in the withholding return or disclosed by schedules or statements
thereto attached. However, where adjustments are made between employer and
employee, disclosure shall be made in a statement supporting the annual
schedule or schedules filed pursuant to these regulations.
(Prior Code, § 110.13) (Minute book AA, page 47, passed 12-13-1974)
§ 110.14 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Any information gained by the Treasurer, Director of Finance, or any other
official, agent, or employee of the city a result of any returns,
investigations, hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this
chapter shall be confidential, except in accordance with proper judicial order,
and any person or agent divulging such information shall, upon conviction, be
subject to a fine of not less than $500 or imprisonment not to exceed 12
months, or both, at the discretion of the court, and shall be dismissed from
employment by the city upon conviction. However, such person may disclose to
the Commissioner of Revenue of the State of Kentucky or its duly authorized
agent all such information and the right to inspect any of the books and
records of the city if the Commissioner of Revenue grants to the city the
reciprocal right to obtain information from the files and records of the
Department of Revenue of the state and maintains the privileged character of
the information so furnished to him or her.

§ 110.15 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   All license fees imposed by this chapter remaining unpaid after they become

shall be liable, in addition to the fee and interest, to a penalty of 10% of
the amount of such unpaid license fee.

   All moneys derived from license fees under the provisions of this chapter
shall be paid to the City Treasurer and placed to the credit of the General
Revenue Fund of the city and shall be used and expended in defraying current,
general, and incidental expenses of the city. It is the purpose of this chapter
to provide revenue for the General Fund and it is not the intention of the city
or of this chapter to impose and require an occupational license fee prohibited
by law.

§ 110.17 ADMINISTRATION.
   This chapter shall be administered by the Director of Finance under the
direction of the Common Council. The Director of Finance with the approval of
the Common Council shall have authority to issue and promulgate such
regulations as he or she may consider necessary for the administration of this
chapter, provided, that such regulations are not inconsistent with the
provisions of this chapter. No license shall be issued for any unlawful
activity, or for any business that the Director of Finance with approval of the
Mayor shall consider to be detrimental to the public welfare or contrary to the
public interest; but any such decision to refuse to issue a license may be
appealed to the Common Council.

in, on, or at the premises covered by the license in violation of any provision
of this chapter or any other ordinance of the city or of any statute of the
commonwealth against gambling, disorderly conduct, or any other offense, and a
judgment of conviction in the Police Court of the city, or in any other court
of competent jurisdiction, shall be conclusive evidence of such violation;
      (2)   If there shall occur in, on, or at the premises covered by the
license any condition which is a nuisance or obnoxious to the morals and
general welfare of the public;
      (3)   If any person is disorderly in, on, or at the premises covered by

      (4)   If the holder of the license shall misrepresent any material facts
as to the kind of business in his or her return, or any other fact necessary or

   (B)   When the Mayor has probable cause to believe that a license should be
revoked for any of the causes enumerated herein, it shall be his or her duty to
prefer charges against the holder of such license by filing a statement of the
charges against the holder of the license with the City Clerk; the charges
shall be in writing and each charge shall be clearly set out. Within three days
after the filing of the charges and of the time of the hearing thereof, the
statement of charges shall be mailed to the licensee at the address shown on
the license and a hearing before the Common Council shall be held within ten
days after the filing of the charges with the Council. The evidence shall be
transcribed and the action and decision of the Common Council on the charges

§ 110.19 ENFORCEMENT.
   It shall be the duty of the members of the Police Department of the city to

dismissal through proceedings before the Common Council of the city in
accordance with state statutes.

   (A)   In lieu of the requirements of §§
110.02,
110.05 to
110.10, and
110.13, an employer may pay to the city an employer annual estimated license
fee. The fee, which is deemed an obligation of the employer, shall be paid to
the city on or prior to January l5 of each year and shall be calculated by
determining 2% of the estimated annual compensation, as defined in §
110.01, to be paid to its employees working within the city for that year. The
estimated compensation shall be determined by multiplying by four, the
compensation paid to all employees working within the city during the fourth
quarter of the prior calender year.
   (B)   On or prior to April l5 of the year following the year in which an
estimated license fee payment is made, the employer shall file a return
calculating 2% of the compensation actually paid to its employees working
within the city during the prior year. The return shall also show the
difference between the amount paid for the annual estimated fee and 2% of the
applicable employees compensation for that year. In the event 2% of the
applicable annual employee compensation shall be less than the amount paid for
the estimated fee, the employer shall not be entitled to a refund. Should 2% of
the applicable annual employee compensation exceed the estimated fee by 10% or
less, no additional payment shall be required by the employer. Should 2% of the
applicable annual employee compensation exceed the estimated fee by more than
10%, the employer shall include payment for any amount in excess of 10% with
its return.
   (C)   Any employer who has paid the employer annual estimated license fee in
a prior year and fails to pay it on or before January 15 of the next subsequent
year shall be sent a delinquent notice by the City Clerk notifying the employer
that unless it makes payment of the estimated fee in full within 30 days, it
shall be deemed to have waived its right to elect to pay the fee. Any employer
who receives the delinquent notice and fails to make payment within the 30 days
or any employer who has not paid the employer annual estimated license fee in
the prior year and fails to do so on or before January 15 of the current year
shall be deemed to have waived its right to elect to pay the fee and shall be
subject to all other applicable provisions of this chapter.

annual license of that type.
(Prior Code, § 114.018) (Ord. FY 20-21, #2, passed 8-18-2021)
§ 114.024 PAYMENT OF LICENSE FEES; DELINQUENCY.
   No licensee shall enter into or begin operating any business for which a
license is required by this chapter until the license fee has been paid in
full. The fee for renewal of any license shall be paid with the renewal

(Prior Code, § 114.019) (Ord. FY 20-21, #2, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 114.025 REFUND OF FEES.
   (A)   Should any licensee under this chapter be prohibited from conducting
the licensed business for the full period covered by the license because of any
changes that may hereafter be made in the laws of the commonwealth with
reference to alcoholic beverages or other causes outside licensee’s control,
then the city shall refund to the licensee the proportionate part of the
license fee for the period during which the licensee is prevented from carrying
on business if the licensee provided sufficient proof to the Administrator that
such period of inactivity was not the fault of the licensee or the result of a
revocation, suspension, or other wrongdoing by licensee, or an agent or
employee of the licensee.
   (B)   In the event a violation of this chapter occurs that results in the
suspension or revocation of the license, the city shall not be required to
refund any portion of the license fee.
(Prior Code, § 114.020) (Ord. FY 20-21, #2, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 114.026 REGULATORY LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   Pursuant to KRS 242.1244 and 243.075, there is hereby imposed a
regulatory license fee on the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of
each license issued by the Administrator. The regulatory license fee shall be
5% of gross sales of all alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. In the case of
retail sales of packaged malt, distilled spirits and wine, the regulatory
license fee shall be 7% of gross sales. Thereafter, the City Council shall
adopt at the budget adoption for each subsequent fiscal year, such annual rate
for the regulatory license fee as shall be reasonably estimated to ensure full
reimbursement to the city for the cost of any additional policing, regulatory,
or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the
city. Should the city fail to address the regulatory license fee in any budget,
then the regulatory license fee shall remain at the level at which it was last
fixed until such time as the City Council shall adjust the fee.
   (B)   Payment of such regulatory fee shall be remitted to the City Clerk,
and shall be held in a separate account maintained for the purpose of fully
reimbursing the city for the estimated cost of any additional policing,
regulatory or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic beverages
in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in addition to any other
taxes, fees, or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit against a
regulatory license fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount equal to any
license fee imposed by the city pursuant to KRS 243.070. Payment of the
regulatory license fee shall accompany the license fee return approved for such
use by the City Council. Monthly revenue tax forms and payment are due to the
City Clerk by the last day of each month. A hard copy of all annual license
renewal submissions should be sent to the City Clerk.
   (C)   Failure to pay such quarterly remittance within ten days of the due
date constitutes a violation and will subject licensee to suspension or
revocation.
   (D)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay monthly remittance by the
due date is 5% of the tax for each 90 days or fraction thereof. The total late
filing penalty shall not exceed 25% of the fee; provided, however, that in no
case shall the penalty be less than $10.
   (E)   Interest at the rate of 8% per annum will apply to any late payments.
(Prior Code, § 114.021) (Ord. FY 20-21, #2, passed 8-18-2020)
CITY ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL ADMINISTRATOR

“Administrator”) are assignable to the City Clerk and all payments and
collections of city regulatory license fees, and monthly revenue taxes shall be
paid to and processed by the City Clerk.
   (B)   The ABC Administrator shall be appointed by the Mayor with Council
approval. No regulation of the Administrator shall become effective until the
City Council has first approved the appointment of the Administrator. The
functions of the Administrator shall be the same with respect to the city
licenses and regulations as the functions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control
Board of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (ABC Board) with respect to state
licenses and regulations, except that no amendment to these regulations
proposed by the Administrator may be less stringent than the statutes relating
to alcoholic beverage control, or than regulations of the ABC Board. The
Administrator shall inspect each licensed establishment for proper display of
required licenses and signage and meet annually with each licensed
establishment for license renewal, any training concerns, revenue tax forms,
and any city ordinance changes or amendments. The Administrator shall send out
annual regulatory license fee renewal notifications and maintain updated
records of current licensees. The Administrator shall be available in a timely
manner to each license holder for responses to questions or concerns and should
check email often for any license applications or update. The Administrator
shall maintain contact with the City Clerk and/or Deputy Clerk to ensure there
are no delinquent revenue accounts and assist license holders with resolution
of delinquent revenue accounts as needed. The Administrator shall assist the
Clerk, Deputy Clerk, and Finance Committee in completing the annual alcohol
revenue report and attend annual training provided by the commonwealth and
shall meet all other requirements and duties expressed in the city’s alcohol
regulations.

of the city under the supervision of the Administrator, who would be
disqualified to be a member of the ABC Board under KRS 241.100.
   (D)   The Administrator shall have all authority as authorized under KRS
Chapters 241 through 244. The Administrator, and any Administrator’s

shall take the oath as prescribed in § 228 of the Constitution and shall

$1,000. The Administrator may require any employee under the Administrator’s
supervision to execute a similar bond in such penal sum as the Administrator

§ 114.041 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeals from the orders of the Administrator may be taken to the State
ABC Board by filing with the Board within 30 days a certified copy of the
orders of the Administrator. The Board shall hear matters at issue as upon an
original proceeding. Appeals from orders of the Administrator shall be governed
by KRS Chapter 13B.
   (B)   When any decision of the Administrator shall have been appealed, or
when a protest has been lodged against an application for any license within
the city, and the ABC Board shall have made a decision regarding such appeal or
protested application, the Administrator, upon receipt of notice of finality of
the decision, shall enter such orders and take such action as required by the
final order of the ABC Board. As provided by law, and as used herein, no order
of the ABC Board is final until all appeals or appeal time shall have been
exhausted. A “final order” of the ABC Board is the order entered by the Board,
unless an appeal is taken from the Board’s order, in which case the “final
order” is the order entered by the Board upon direction from the reviewing
court of last resort in the final order of the reviewing court.

§ 114.057 OTHER CONDITIONS; PROHIBITIONS.
   In addition to any other inquiries, conditions, or considerations required
or permitted by law:
   (A)   The Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage license or
approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his or her place of
business shall have been approved by the City Building Inspector, and any and

   (C)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be granted or

Administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending

opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a City or State ABC
Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a
license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for
appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations, or suspensions under
this section. This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit monetary
settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order
or revocation or suspension, where the ordinance and applicable statutes allow
for such payments in settlement.

issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the Administrator within ten days of the change.
   (B)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership

business organization herein, the word CHANGE is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the

the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than 10% of the total
ownership or stock shall require a new license.

LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license
in any other state or province.

shall be made within ten days of any change of required information.

   (A)   Every year, except in the case of temporary licenses, each licensee
shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the
Administrator no less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the license for
the proceeding license period or the same shall be canceled, except where the
licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises licensed during
the proceeding license period as a result of construction, act of God,
casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the premises by
any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private organization
possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing
lease; provided that the licensee shall file a written verified statement no
less than 20 days from the expiration date of the license, setting forth these
facts, and the Administrator is hereby authorized to extend the time within the
sound discretion of the Administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall
pay a license fee from the expiration date of the former license or licenses.
The license fee shall not by payable until application is made for the transfer
of the license to a new location.
   (B)   The renewal by the Administrator of the license shall not be construed
to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to such
renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the licensee.
(Prior Code, § 114.050) (Ord. FY 20-21, #2, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 114.061 LOST OR DESTROYED LICENSE.
   When a license shall be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of the
licensee or his or her agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the original
license shall be issued by the Administrator after the Administrator shall have
been satisfied as to the facts; provided, however, that the applicant for the
duplicate license shall pay a fee of $10 for the duplicate license.
(Prior Code, § 114.051) (Ord. FY 20-21, #2, passed 8-18-2020)

her instructions, or any such license may be revoked or suspended for any cause
which the Administrator, in the exercise of his or her sound discretion, deems
sufficient.
   (B)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the
Administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had
been known.
   (C)   In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be revoked
or suspended for the following causes:
      (1)   Conviction of the licensee or his or her agent or employee for
selling any illegal beverages on the licensed premises;
      (2)   Making any false, material statements in an application for a
license;
      (3)   If within a period of two consecutive years, any licensee or any
clerk, servant, agent, or employee of the licensee shall have been convicted of
two violations of the terms and provisions of KRS Chapters 241 through 244 or
any act heretofore or hereafter in effect relating to the regulations of the
manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages or if within such
period, any licensee or any clerk, servant, agent, or employee of the license

taxation, or for a violation of any rules or regulations of the Department of
Revenue made in pursuance thereof; and
      (5)   Setting up, conducting, operating or keeping, on the licensed
premises, any gambling game, device, machine or contrivance, or lottery or gift
enterprise, or handbook or facility for betting or transmitting bets on horse

§ 114.063 PROCEEDINGS FOR REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE; NOTICE AND
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTEST; APPEAL; EFFECT OF REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.
   (A)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any
law enforcement officer or of the Administrator, the Administrator may
institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license granted under this
chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after the licensee shall
have been given written notice, by certified or registered mail, of the
proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such proposed action.
The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in opposition to the
proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed action shall advise
the licensee of the date, time, and place of the hearing. Notice shall be
sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in the last
application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or an
amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
   (B)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall be prescribed by the City Council by municipal
order. Such order shall be maintained on file in the office of the
Administrator and a copy furnished with any notice of proposed revocation or
suspension sent to a licensee. If the Council shall fail to adopt such
municipal order, the procedures shall be those set out in the Kentucky
Administrative Procedure Act (KRS Chapter 13B).
   (C)   A decision of the Administrator revoking or suspending a license may
be appealed as provided in KRS 243.550.
   (D)   Within three days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the Administrator. If the revoked or suspended
license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of Police at
the request of the Administrator shall immediately cause one of his or her
officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to the
Administrator.
   (E)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee may,
with prior approval of the Administrator, dispose of and transfer his or her
stock of alcoholic beverage to an appropriate entity.

Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at once
suspend all operations authorized under his or her license.
      (2)   Upon the entry of a final order of the ABC Board sustaining or
ordering revocation or suspension on appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend
all operations under this license.

§ 114.065 REFUSAL OF LICENSE; GUIDELINES FOR APPROVAL OF QUOTA LICENSES; CITY
ALCOHOL BOARD.
   (A)   The Administrator may refuse to issue or renew a license for any of
the following reasons:
      (1)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for suspension
or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for state
licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as violation of
any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or the
Administrator thereof;
      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of license
would be authorized; or
      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
   (B)   For the purpose of consideration of quota retail package licenses,
there is hereby established the Middlesboro Alcohol Licensing Board. The
Alcohol Board shall have three members, appointed by the Mayor and with the
approval of the Council. All members must be residents of the city at all times
while in service to the Board. Board members shall be appointed to serve
staggered one, two and three year terms. The function of the Board is to meet
in review of quota licensure requests and applications and to apply and assess
the factors listed under divisions (F)(1), (F)(2), (F)(3), (F)(4), (F)(5), and
(F)(6) of this section to make recommendations for the issuance of quota retail
package licenses. After thorough review and assessment, the Board members, if a
majority are in agreement, may make a formal and binding recommendation to the
Administrator, that the Administrator shall accept and act upon, concerning the
issuance of any quota retail package license. If the Board cannot reach a
majority agreement, the Administrator shall make the final recommendation. The
Board and Administrator reserve all right and power to have any applicant
before it on hearing in consideration of the division (F)(1) through (F)(6)
criteria and can request any pertinent information and documentation from the
applicant or request the filing of written answers to any questions focused on
the merits of the division (F)(1) through (F)(6) criteria.
   (C)   The Board shall also review any request for the transfer of a quota
retail package license, along with the Administrator, to make sure the request
for transfer complies with all regulations within this chapter and that the
proposed transferee is eligible for reception of the subject quota retail
package license.
   (D)   No member of the Board may exercise any discretion or make any
recommendation if that member has any personal or familial conflict of interest
as it relates to the issuance of a quota retail package license.
   (E)   No elected official may serve on the Board.
   (F)   In the case of quota licenses, before approving an application and
making any recommendation, the Administrator and the Middlesboro Alcohol
Licensure Board is hereby directed to consider, in addition to the factors set
out in KRS 243.450, 243.490, and 243.500, and any other factors the
Administrator determines in his or her discretion to be reasonable and
pertinent to the license application, the following criteria:
      (1)   Ownership. The city places great value on business owners who are
invested in the Middlesboro community;
      (2)   Economic impact. The city desires businesses which make the most
positive impact on the community, in number of jobs, payroll, property
investment, and revenues to the city;
      (3)   Site of business. The city is interested in serving all geographic
areas if the city. Therefore, the city does not wish to cluster all licensed
ABC outlets in one area;
      (4)   Aesthetics. The city is committed to protecting the character and
beauty of our community;
      (5)   Revitalization of downtown. The city wholeheartedly supports the
revitalization of downtown and the revitalization and refuse of existing
buildings; and
      (6)   Capital. The city values businesses that demonstrate their ability
to financially support and sustain their viability.
   (G)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the Administrator may
appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KRS 241.200.
(Prior Code, § 114.055) (Ord. FY 20-21, #2, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 114.066 REVIEW OF LICENSE; BOOKS, RECORDS AND REPORTS.
   (A)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter shall
provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of
any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant’s business income is earned from sale of
food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated with
the applicant’s quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide the
form schedule to the licensee. The licensee’s acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identify each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ration of
food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for
filing of reports notwithstanding, the City Administrator or designee may at
any time come upon the premises of any licensee and examine the books and
records to determine whether the license requirements are met during any
particular quarter, the Administrator shall have discretion in determining
whether revocation is appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a
reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is
demonstrated by the licensee, the Administrator may apply an accounting period
of at least one year in determining whether or not the food sale percentage
requirement has been met.
   (B)   (1)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain upon
the licensed premises adequate books and records of all transactions involved
in the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the Administrator and such city employees
who may assist the Administrator in his or her review.
      (2)   For the purpose of assisting the Administrator in enforcement of
this chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC Board under KRS
243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the City Clerk. Copies of any
and all reports and correspondences to the ABC Board required by statute shall
be furnished to the Administrator.
(Prior Code, § 114.056) (Ord. FY 20-21, #2, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 114.067 DORMANCY.
   (A)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after 90 days. Such is the intent of this section.
Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her business
interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various exceptions to
the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
   (B)   (1)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a
period of 90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth
in division (C) of this section are proved to the satisfaction of the
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the Administrator.
      (2)   If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked
by the Administrator.
   (C)   The provisions of this division (C) shall not apply to any licensee
who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a license is
issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of
the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency under
power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or
loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the
expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to the
Administrator a verified statement setting forth the fact that the licensee is
unable to continue in business, for the dormancy with the license continuing to
remain in effect during the license period or until same is transferred to
another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted
during the period; provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid
unless business is conducted thereunder within 12 months from the date of
notice to the Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal
date but may be for such times that the Administrator deems appropriate in
exercise of his or her sound discretion.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LIABILITY
§ 130.15 DEFINITIONS PERTAINING TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LIABILITY.
   For the purpose of this code, the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CULPABLE MENTAL STATE. Means one of the following.
      (1)   INTENTIONALLY. A person acts intentionally with respect to a result
or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his or her
conscious objective is to cause that result or to engage in that conduct.
      (2)   KNOWINGLY. A person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a
circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he or she is aware
that his or her conduct is of that nature or that the circumstance exists.
      (3)   RECKLESSLY. A person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to
a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he or she fails
to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or
that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that
failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care
that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.
      (4)   WANTONLY. A person acts wantonly with respect to a result or to a
circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he or she is aware
of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the
result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such
nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the
standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. A
person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of
voluntary intoxication also acts wantonly with respect thereto.
(KRS 501.010; KRS 501.020)
   INTOXICATION. A disturbance of mental or physical capacities resulting from
the introduction of substances into the body.
   VOLUNTARY ACT. A bodily movement performed consciously as a result of effort
or determination and includes the possession of property if the actor was aware
of his or her physical possession or control thereof for a sufficient period to
have been able to terminate it.
   VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION. Intoxication caused by substances which the
defendant knowingly introduces into his or her body, the tendency of which to
cause intoxication he or she knows or ought to know, unless he or she
introduces them pursuant to medical advice or under such duress as would afford
a defense to a charge of crime.
(KRS 501.010)
(Prior Code, § 130.03)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   A person is not guilty of a criminal offense unless:
   (A)   He or she has engaged in conduct which includes a voluntary act or the
omission to perform a duty which the law imposes upon him or her and which he
or she is physically capable of performing; and
   (B)   He or she or she has engaged in such conduct INTENTIONALLY, KNOWINGLY,
WANTONLY, or RECKLESSLY as the law may require, with respect to each element of
the offense, except that this requirement does not apply to any offense which
imposes absolute liability, as defined in §
130.18.
(KRS 501.030) (Prior Code, § 130.04)
§ 130.17 CULPABILITY; CONSTRUCTION OF STATUTES.
   Although no culpable mental state is expressly designated in a statute
defining an offense, a culpable mental state may nevertheless be required for
the commission of such offense, or with respect to some or all of the material
elements thereof, if the proscribed conduct necessarily involves such culpable
mental state.
(KRS 501.040) (Prior Code, § 130.05)
§ 130.18 ABSOLUTE LIABILITY.
   A person may be guilty of an offense without having one of the culpable
mental states defined in §

   (A)   The offense is a violation or a misdemeanor as defined in §
130.02, and no particular culpable mental state is included within the
definition of the offense; or
   (B)   The offense is defined by a statute other than this code and the
statute clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability
for the conduct described.
(KRS 501.050) (Prior Code, § 130.06)
INCHOATE OFFENSES
§ 130.30 CRIMINAL ATTEMPT.
   (A)   A person is guilty of criminal attempt to commit a crime when, acting
with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he
or she:
      (1)   Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime
if the attendant circumstances were as he or she believes them to be; or
      (2)   Intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the
circumstances as he or she believes them to be, is a substantial step in a
course of conduct planned to culminate in his or her commission of the crime.
   (B)   Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under
division (A)(2) of this section, unless it is an act or omission which leaves
no reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s intention to commit the crime which
he or she is charged with attempting.
   (C)   A person is guilty of criminal attempt to commit a crime when he or
she engages in conduct intended to aid another person to commit that crime
although the crime is not committed or attempted by the other person, provided
that his or her conduct would establish complicity under KRS 502.020 if the
crime were committed by the other person.
   (D)   A criminal attempt is a:
      (1)   Class A misdemeanor when the crime attempted is a Class C or D

130.99
§ 130.31 CRIMINAL ATTEMPT; DEFENSE OF RENUNCIATION.
   (A)   In any prosecution for criminal attempt to commit a crime, it is a
defense that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose, the defendant abandoned his or her
effort to commit the crime and, if mere abandonment was insufficient to avoid
the commission of the crime, took the necessary affirmative steps to prevent
its commission.
   (B)   A renunciation is not “voluntary and complete” within the meaning of
this section if it is motivated in whole or in part by:
      (1)   A belief that circumstances exist which pose a particular threat of
apprehension or detection of the accused or another participant in the criminal
enterprise or which render more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal
purpose; or
      (2)   A decision to postpone the criminal conduct until another time or
to transfer the criminal effort to another victim or another but similar
object.
(KRS 506.020) (Prior Code, § 130.21)

   (A)   A person is guilty of criminal solicitation when, with the intent of
promoting or facilitating the commission of a crime, he or she commands or
encourages another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute
that crime or an attempt to commit that crime or which would establish the
other’s complicity in its commission or attempted commission.
   (B)   A criminal solicitation is a:

interests in or claims to wealth, admission or transportation tickets, captured
or domestic animals, food and drink.
   PROPERTY OF ANOTHER. Includes property in which any person other than the
actor has an interest which the actor is not privileged to infringe, regardless
of the fact that the actor also has an interest in the property and regardless
of the fact that the other person might be precluded from civil recovery
because the property was used in an unlawful transaction or was subject to
forfeiture as contraband. Property in possession of the actor shall not be
deemed property of another who has only a security interest therein, even if
legal title is in the creditor pursuant to a conditional sales contract or
other security arrangement.

(KRS 514.010) (Prior Code, § 132.20)
§ 132.046 GENERAL PROVISIONS PERTAINING TO THEFT AND RELATED OFFENSES.
   (A)   It is a defense to prosecution for theft that the actor:
      (1)   Was unaware that the property or service was that of another;
      (2)   Acted under a claim of right to the property or service involved or
a claim that he or she had a right to acquire or dispose of its as he or she
did; or
      (3)   Took property exposed for sale, intending to purchase and pay for
it promptly, or reasonably believing that the owner, if present, would have
consented.
   (B)   It is no defense that theft was from the actor’s spouse, except that
misappropriation of household and personal effects or other property normally
accessible to both spouses is theft only if it involves the property of the
other spouse and only if it occurs after the parties have ceased living
together.
   (C)   It shall be prima facie evidence of intent to commit theft by fraud
when one who has leased or rented the personal property of another fails to
return the personal property to its owner within ten days after the lease or
rental agreement has expired. It shall also be prima facie evidence of intent
to commit theft by deception when one presents to the owner identification
which is false, fictitious, or not current as to name, address, place of
employment, or other items of identification for the purpose of obtaining the
lease or rental agreement. Nothing herein contained shall relieve the owner
from making demand for return of property so leased or rented. Notice addressed
and mailed to the lessee or renter at the address given at the time of the
making of the lease or rental agreement shall constitute proper demand.

premises, paraphernalia, equipment or apparatus therefor; toward the
solicitation or inducement of persons to participate therein; toward the actual
conduct of the playing phases thereof; toward the arrangement of any of its
financial or recording phases or toward any other phase of its operation. A

without remuneration or fee, directed toward the arrangement or facilitation of
the game as inviting persons to play, permitting the use of premises therefor
and supplying equipment used therein.

business.

contest, game gaming scheme or gaming device which is based upon an element of
chance, in accord with an agreement or understanding that someone will receive
something of value in the event of a certain outcome. A contest or game in

device an essential part of which is a drum or reel with insignia thereon, and

of chance, any money or property, or by the operation of which a person may
become entitled to receive, as the result of the application of an element of
chance, any money or property; or

of a lottery listed in division (1) of this definition is to be considered a
lottery under this chapter.
   MUTUEL or THE NUMBERS GAME. A form of lottery in which the winning chances
or plays are not determined upon the basis of a drawing or other act on the
part of persons conducting or connected with the scheme, but upon the basis of

unrelated to the particular scheme.
   PLAYER. A person who engages in any form of gambling solely as a contestant
or bettor, without receiving or becoming entitled to receive any profit
therefrom other than personal gambling winnings, and without otherwise
rendering any material assistance to the establishment, conduct, or operation
of the particular gambling activity. A person who engages in BOOKMAKING as
defined in this section is not a PLAYER. The status of a PLAYER shall be a
defense to any prosecution under this chapter.
   PROFITING FROM GAMBLING ACTIVITY. A person PROFITS FROM GAMBLING ACTIVITY
when, other than as a player, he or she accepts or receives or agrees to accept
or receive money or other property pursuant to an agreement or understanding
with any person whereby he or she participates or is to participate in the
proceeds of gambling activity.
   SOMETHING OF VALUE. Any money or property, any token, object, or article
exchangeable for money or property, or any form of credit or promise directly
or indirectly contemplating transfer of money or property or of any interest
therein, or involving extension of a service, entertainment, or a privilege of
playing at a game or scheme without charge.

ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONES
§ 150.020 ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   In order to classify, regulate, and restrict the use and location of
buildings designed for specified uses, to regulate and determine the area of
yards, courts, and other open spaces surrounding buildings, and to regulate and
limit the density of population, and to realize the general purposes set forth
in the preamble of this chapter, the city is divided into zoning districts. The
specific purpose of each zoning district is set forth in sections §§
150.035 through
150.040 inclusive.
(Prior Code, § 150.10) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.021 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (A)   The boundaries of these zoning districts are hereby established as
shown on a map entitled “Official Zoning Map for the City of Middlesboro,
Kentucky”. Said zoning map and all notations and references and other matters
shown thereon shall be and are hereby made a part of this chapter.
   (B)   The official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the
Mayor attested by the City Clerk, and bear the seal of the city under the
following words, “This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map for
the City of Middlesboro, Kentucky, referred to in
Chapter 150 of the Official Zoning Ordinance for Middlesboro, Kentucky, adopted
by the City Council”.
   (C)   If, in accordance with the provision of this chapter and Kentucky
Revised Statutes, changes are made in the zoning district boundaries or other
matters, portrayed on the official zoning map such changes shall be made on the
official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the
legislative body together with an entry on the official zoning map as follows:
“By official action of the City Council this map was amended as authorized by
ordinance as listed below: (amendment, date, brief description of nature of
change) which entry shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the City
Clerk. The amending ordinance shall provide that such changes or amendments
shall not become effective until they have been duly entered upon the official
zoning map. No amendment to this chapter which involved matter portrayed on the
official zoning map shall become effective until after such change and entry
has been made on said map.”
   (D)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
chapter. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons
shall be considered a violation of this chapter and punishable as provided
under §
150.999.
   (E)   Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning
map which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map
which shall be located in the office of the City Clerk shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings,
and other structures in the city.
(Prior Code, § 150.11) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991; Ord. FY 20-21, #7,
passed 4-4-2021)
§ 150.022 REPLACEMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost,
or difficult to interpret because of the nature of number of changes and
additions, the City Council may by resolution adopt a new official zoning map
which shall supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning
map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official
zoning map, but such correction shall have the effect of amending the original
zoning ordinance or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning
map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the City
Clerk, and bear the seal of the city under the following words: “This is to
certify that this official zoning map supersedes and replaces the official
zoning map adopted (date of adoption of map being replaced) as part of the
Official Zoning Ordinance for Middlesboro, Kentucky.”
(Prior Code, § 150.12) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.023 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the zoning
districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
   (A)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines;
   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines;

in divisions (A) through (E) of this section shall be so construed. Distances
not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by
the scale of the map;
   (G)   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances
not covered by divisions (A) through (F) of this section, the Planning
Commission shall interpret the district boundaries; and
   (H)   Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single
ownership at the time of passage of this code, the Planning Commission may
permit, conditionally, the extension of the regulations for either portion of
the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line into the remaining
portion of the lot.
(Prior Code, § 150.13) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.024 ANNEXATIONS.

      (21)   Mobile home prohibition. Mobile homes shall be permitted only in
mobile home parks.
   (D)   Planned unit developments.
      (1)   Objectives for planned unit developments. It shall be the policy of
the city to promote progressive development of land and construction thereon by
encouraging planned unit developments to achieve:
         (a)   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a
reduction in lot dimensions, yards, and area requirements;
         (b)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services;
         (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural
topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation,
and prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
         (d)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets;
         (e)   A development pattern in harmony with land use density,
transportation facilities, and community facilities objectives of the
comprehensive plan; and
         (f)   The city is also prepared to accept a greater population density
in undeveloped areas than that reflected by present zoning, provided the
developer can demonstrate that any increment of public cost clearly
attributable to increased densities will be compensated for by the private
amenities and public benefits to be achieved by the plan of development.
      (2)   Provisions governing planned unit developments.
         (a)   Because of the special characteristics of planned unit
developments, special provisions governing the development of land for this
purpose are required. Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the
provisions of this division (D) and those of the other sections of the chapter,
the provisions of this division (D) shall prevail for the development of land
for planned unit developments. Subjects not covered by this division (D) shall
be governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this chapter, and/
or in the subdivision regulations.
         (b)   Compatible residential, commercial (B-1), public, and quasi-
public uses may be combined in PUD districts provided that the proposed
location of the commercial uses will not adversely affect adjacent property,
and/or the public health, safety, and general welfare. Lot area and other yard
requirements of the residential districts established in this section shall
apply except as modified in §
150.037. Dwelling units in detached, semi-detached, attached or multi-family
structures, or any combination thereof (to include townhouses) are permitted.
      (3)   Project ownership. The project land shall be owned, leased, or
controlled either by a single person or corporation (business entity). Such
ownership may be by a public or private corporation.
      (4)   Common open space and disposition thereof. A minimum of 20% of the
land developed in any planned unit development project shall be reserved for
common open space and recreational facilities for the residents or users of the
area being developed as determined by the Planning Commission. The required
amount of common open space land reserved under a planned unit development
shall either be held in corporate ownership by owners of the project area for
the use of each owner who buys property within the development or be dedicated
to the city and retained as common open space for parks, recreation, and
related uses. All land dedicated to the city must meet the Planning
Commission’s requirements as to size, shape, and location. Public utility and
similar easements and right-of-ways, for watercourses and other similar
channels are not acceptable for common open space dedication to the city unless
such land or right-of-way is usable as a trail or other similar purpose and
approved by the Planning Commission. The responsibility for the maintenance of
all open spaces shall be specified by the developer before approval of the
final development plan.
      (5)   Utility requirements. Underground utilities, including telephone
and electrical systems, are recommended within the limits of all planned unit
developments. Appurtenances to these systems which can be effectively screened
may be exempted from this requirement if the Planning Commission finds that
such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the proposed planned
unit development.
      (6)   Minimum project area. The gross area of a parcel of land to be
developed in a planned unit development district shall be a minimum of one
acre, provided, however, that smaller parcels may be considered on the basis of
their potential to satisfy the objectives of this chapter as stated in §
150.037. When the planned unit development proposes a mixture of residential
uses with commercial uses, the Planning Commission may limit the development
for commercial uses. No commercial development shall be allowed prior to
completion of the residential development. When commercial use is allowed, the
developer will submit a market analysis.
      (7)   Minimum lot sizes. Lot area per dwelling unit may be reduced to not
less than 1,900 square feet. Lot widths may be varied to allow for a variety of
structural designs, but must be a minimum of 20 feet. The front setback will be
a minimum of 25 feet. Spacing between the exterior walls of side buildings
shall be at least 15 feet.
      (8)   Height requirements. For each foot of building height over the
maximum height regulations specified in §
150.037, the distance between such buildings and the side and rear property
lines of the planned unit development project area shall be increased by a one
foot addition to the side and rear yard required in the districts.
      (9)   Parking. Off-street parking, loading, and service areas shall be
provided in accordance with §
150.039 of this chapter.
      (10)   Perimeter yards. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter,
every lot abutting the perimeter of the planned unit development district shall
maintain all yard requirements specified in §
150.005 for the applicable conventional zoning district.
      (11)   Lots to abut upon common open space. Every property developed
under the planned unit development approach should be designed to abut upon
common open space or similar areas. A clustering of dwellings is encouraged. In
areas where townhouses are used, there shall be no more than eight individual
townhouse units in any contiguous group.
      (12)   Procedure for application and approval of planned unit
developments. All proposed planned unit development shall follow the procedure
for plat preparation and subdivision approval as set forth in the city
subdivision regulations. In addition, the Planning Commission shall hold a
public hearing on the preliminary plat of the proposed planned unit development
to aid them in deciding the merits of the proposed project. (Nothing herein
should be construed to mean that the landowner has the inherent right to
develop a planned unit development. The Planning Commission has the power to
decide whether or not to allow the planned unit development based on their
experience, knowledge, public hearing and the standards set forth herein.)
Accompanying all preliminary plats shall be calculations for overall density,
parking requirements and other material the Commission may reasonably require.
If the Planning Commission approves the preliminary plat the developer may
proceed with activities leading to the final plat approval, providing that the
project shall be developed in conformance with the approved preliminary plat.
Upon approval by the Planning Commission and the City Council a planned unit
development district may be allowed in any existing residential district. Upon
approval of a final development plan, the official zoning map shall be
annotated for the land area involved so that the district name includes the
notation, “PUD”. A building permit and certificate of occupancy shall be
required for each building in accordance with §§
150.056 and
150.057 of this chapter. Approval of a planned unit development shall expire if
no substantial work on the site has begun within one year of original approval
of the preliminary plat, and if the project is abandoned for more than 12
consecutive months. (Abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred when no
improvements have been made pursuant to the approved planned unit development
plat.) All approved planned unit development plats shall be recorded in the
City Clerk’s office.

   (B)   Condominium project application procedures.
      (1)   A developer, owner, or co-owners of a proposed condominium project
shall make application for project approval to the city’s Code Enforcement
Officer. Since a condominium involves ownership of single units in a multiple
unit structure, the applicant shall adhere to the appropriate sections of the
zoning regulations dealing with the zone in which the condominium project is
being developed. The application shall be accompanied by the following
supplementary information:
         (a)   The description of the land, whether leased or in fee simple,
and the building, expressing their respective areas;
         (b)   The general description and the number of each apartment,
expressing its area, location, and any other data necessary for its
identification;
         (c)   The description of the general common elements of the building;
         (d)   The common elements, both general and limited, shall remain
undivided and shall not be the object of an action for partition or division of
the co-ownership. Any covenant to the contrary shall be void; and
         (e)   A set of floor plans of the building or buildings, showing the
layout, location, apartment numbers and dimensions of the units, stating the
name of the property or that it has no name, and bearing the verified statement

the plans.
(KRS 381.835)
      (2)   The owner of a unit designed for office, industrial, or business
use may divide his or her unit into two or more smaller units. No interest in
the unit shall be conveyed until the master deed and floor plans have been
modified as provided in this section. Prior to subdividing his or her unit, the
owner shall prepare a set of floor plans which shall show the changes being
made in the unit involved. The plans shall bear the verified statement of a
registered architect or professional engineer that they accurately portray the
unit involved and the changes being made and the unit owner shall attach to the
plans a verified statement which shall contain:
         (a)   The name by which the property is known;
         (b)   A reference to the book and page of the recorded master deed and
floor plans of the property and any amendments thereto in the office of the
County Clerk of the county in which the land described in the master deed is
situated;
         (c)   The original unit number of each unit involved in the division,
a description or designation of the building in which the unit is located, and
the new unit number of each unit being formed;
         (d)   A statement of the location, approximate area, number of rooms,
and the structural changes in the perimeter and interior walls, floors,
ceilings, windows, and doors of the unit being formed and the immediate common

changes to the original unit;
         (e)   A description of the percentage of interest of the original unit
in the common elements, and a description of the new percentage or percentages
of interest in the common elements of the units being formed. The percentage of
interest in the common elements of the units being formed shall be in
proportion to the floor area of the original unit and shall, when taken
cumulatively, total the same percentage of interest in the common elements as
that of the original unit; and
         (f)   Any further provisions that would serve to clarify the changes
being made.
      (3)   The floor plans and verified statement shall be approved in writing
by a majority, unless otherwise provided by the master deed, or the council of
co-owners, and by any person holding a lien on such units, and shall be filed
for record with the County Clerk in the county in which the land described in
the master deed is situated as provided in KRS 381.835. The floor plans and
verified statement shall be considered as an amendment to the original master
deed and floor plans for the sole purpose of dividing a unit and the
corresponding percentage of interest in the common elements.
(KRS 381.827)
      (4)   The City Code Enforcement Officer shall complete his or her review
within 30 days of receipt of the application. If the project is disapproved,
the grounds for disapproval shall be given in writing. The city’s Code
Enforcement Officer shall provide the Planning Commission with information on
condominiums for planning purposes. Following approval, the applicant expressly
declares, through the recordation of a master deed or lease (enumerating the
particulars stated above in divisions (B)(1)(a) through (B)(1)(e) of this
section), the desire to submit the property in question to the regime
established by KRS 381.805 to 381.910. When this declaration is duly recorded
by the County Clerk, a condominium property regime is created.
(KRS 381.815)
      (5)   Once the property is submitted to the condominium property regime,
an apartment in the building(s) may be individually conveyed and encumbered and
may be the subject of ownership, possession, or sale and of all types of
juridic acts inter vivos or mortis causa, as if it were sole and entirely
independent of the other units in the building(s) of which they form a part,
and the corresponding individual titles and interest shall be recordable.
(KRS 381.820)
      (6)   Any unit may be jointly or commonly owned by more than one person.
(KRS 381.825)
      (7)   A unit owner shall have the exclusive ownership to his or her unit
and shall have a common right to a share, with other co-owners, in the common
elements of the property, equivalent to the percentage representing the value
of the individual unit, with relation to the value of the whole property. This
percentage shall be computed by taking as a basis the floor area of the
individual unit in relation to the floor area of the property as a whole.
      (8)   The percentage shall be expressed at the time the condominium
property regime is constituted, shall have a permanent character, and shall not
be altered without the acquiescence of the co-owner representing all the units
of the building(s), except as may be otherwise provided in KRS 381.810 to
381.910. The master deed may however, contain provisions relating to the
appropriation, taking or condemnation by eminent domain by the federal, state,
or local government, or an instrumentally thereof, including, but not limited
to, reapportionment or other change of the common interest appurtenant to each
unit, or part thereof remaining after a partial appropriation, taking or
condemnation. The master deed of a regime under construction may further
provide that by later amendment thereto and upon completion of all units,
percentage of common interest shall be redistributed on an as-built basis;
provided, however, that the number of units originally constituted in the
regime may not be increased during construction.
      (9)   Each co-owner may use the general common elements in accordance
with the purpose for which they are intended, without hindering or encroaching
upon the lawful rights of the other co-owners.
(KRS 381.830)
      (10)   If a condominium does not contain any unit which is designed for
occupancy by only one family or household, or if the floor area of all those
units which are designed for occupancy by only one family or household does not
in the aggregate exceed 10% of the floor area of all units in the condominium,
then the following provisions shall be applicable notwithstanding any other
provisions of this chapter.
      (11)   The master deed may provide:
         (a)   That to any extent specified in the master deed the common
profits shall be distributed among, and the common expenses shall be charged
to, the unit owners in proportions other than according to their respective
percentages of the undivided interest in the common areas and facilities;
         (b)   That to any extent specified in the master deed the unit owners
shall not be personally liable for sums assessed for their share of common
expenses but such provisions shall not adversely affect any lien for said
share;
         (c)   That the priority provided in KRS 381.883(2) shall not prohibit
subordination of a mortgage lien to the lien for common expenses;
         (d)   A procedure for submitting the disputes arising from the
administration of the condominium to arbitration or other impartial
determination;
         (e)   Provisions giving a particular unit owner or owners voting
rights with respect to election of directors, trustees, or members of a
managing board less than, or in excess of, the voting rights which such owner
or owners would otherwise have had, and provisions requiring or permitting
approval of any matter or any specified category or categories of matters, by a
proportion greater than a majority, which proportion may be as great as 100%;
and
         (f)   Terms and conditions differing from those set forth in KRS
381.830 to 381.890 regarding rebuilding made necessary by fire or other
casualty loss, the making of improvements and allocation of the costs of such
rebuilding or improvements, and the removal of the condominium or portion
thereof from the provisions of this chapter; and in such case the terms and
conditions of the master deed shall take precedence over the provisions of KRS
381.830 or 381.890 to the extent they are inconsistent.
(KRS 381.837)
      (12)   The deed of each individual unit shall describe such unit by
making reference to the applicable master deed and floor plans required under
KRS 381.835, designating the letter or number or other appropriate designation
the of the unit, followed by the words “a condominium unit”. Any conveyance of
an individual unit shall be deemed to also convey the undivided interest of the
owner in the common elements, both general and limited, appertaining to said
unit without specifically or particularly referring to same.
(KRS 381.840)
      (13)   All of the co-owners or the sole owner of a building constituted
into a horizontal property regime may waive this regime and request the County
Clerk to regroup or merge the records of the filial estates with the principal
property; provided, that the filial estates are unencumbered, or if encumbered,
that the creditors in whose behalf the encumbrances are recorded agree to
accept as security the undivided portions of the property owned by the debtors.
(KRS 381.850)
      (14)   The merger provided for in KRS 381.850 shall in no way bar the
subsequent constitution of the property into another horizontal property regime
whenever so desired and upon observance of the provisions of KRS 381.805 to
381.910.
(KRS 381.855)
      (15)   The administration of every building constituted into a
condominium property regime shall be governed by bylaws approved and adopted by
the council of co-owners. The bylaws may be amended from time to time by the
Council.
(KRS 381.860)
      (16)   Other legal requirements pertaining to bookkeeping, maintenance,
liens, foreclosures, insurance, and related business matters can be found be
referring to KRS 381.860 through 381.900.
      (17)   The provisions of KRS 381.805 to 381.910 shall be in addition to
and supplemental to all other provisions of the Kentucky Revised Statutes;
provided, that wherever the application of the provisions of KRS 381.805 to
381.910 conflict with the application of such other provisions, KRS 381.805 to
381.910 shall prevail.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 150.055 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL, DUTIES AND POWERS.
   (A)   An administrative official designated by the City Council shall
administer and enforce this chapter. The administrative official may be
provided with the assistance of such other persons as the City Council may
direct.
   (B)   For the purpose of this chapter the administrative official shall have
the following duties:
      (1)   Upon finding that any of the provisions of this chapter are being
violated, notify in writing the person responsible for such violation(s),
ordering the action necessary to correct such violation;
      (2)   Order discontinuance of illegal uses of land, building, or
structures;
      (3)   Order removal of illegal buildings or structures or illegal
additions or structural alterations;
      (4)   Order discontinuance of any illegal work being done;
      (5)   Take any other action authorized by this chapter to ensure
compliance with or to prevent violation(s) of this chapter. This may include
the issuance of and action on building permits and certificate of occupancy
permits and such similar administrative duties as are permissible under the
law;
      (6)   Make records of all official actions of this office relating to the
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter including, but
not limited to, written records of all complaints and actions taken with regard
thereto, all violations discovered and actions taken thereto, and the final
disposition of all such matters; or
      (7)   Issue building permits or certificates of occupancy, or both, in
accordance with the literal terms of the regulation, but may not have the power
to permit any construction, or to permit any use or any change of use which

§ 150.056 BUILDING PERMITS.
   (A)   Building permits required. No building or other structure shall be

the administrative official except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter, unless he or she receives a written order from the Board of Adjustment
in the form of an administrative review, conditional use permit, or variance as
provided by this chapter. The issuance of a building permit for development in
a flood-prone area is contingent upon meeting local flood zone requirements. If
no building permit has been issued and a builder begins or continues to build,
a restraining order may be obtained upon application to the proper court of
record and evidence of lack of a building permit shall establish a prima facie
case for the issuance of a restraining order.
   (B)   Application for building permit. All applications for building permits
shall be accompanied by plans in duplicate drawn to scale, showing the actual
dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon: The exact sizes and locations
on the lot of building already existing, if any; and the location and
dimensions of the proposed building or alteration. The application shall
include such other information as lawfully may be required by the
administrative official, including existing or proposed building or alteration;
existing or proposed uses of the building and land; the number of families,
housekeeping units, or rental units the building is designed to accommodate;
proposed drainage plan, conditions existing on the lot; and such other matters
as may be necessary to determine conformance with, and provide for the
enforcement of, other ordinances. One copy of the plans shall be returned to
the applicant by the administrative official, after he or she shall have marked
such copy either as approved or disapproved and attested to same by his or her
signature on the copy. The original copy of the plans, similarly marked shall
be retained by the administrative official.
(Prior Code, § 150.31) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.057 CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY FOR NEW, ALTERED, OR NONCONFORMING
STRUCTURES.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy
of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created,
erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use
of structure, until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued,
therefore by the administrative official stating that the proposed use of the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   No nonconforming structure or use shall be continued until a
certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the administrative official.
The certificate of occupancy shall state specifically the character of the
nonconformity.
   (C)   No permit for erection, alteration, moving, or major repair (as
opposed to normal repair) of any building shall be issued until an application
has been made for a certificate of occupancy, and the certificate shall be
issued in conformity with the provisions of this chapter upon completion of the
work.
   (D)   A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the
administrative official for a period not exceeding six months during
alterations or partial occupancy of a building pending its completion. A
temporary certificate may include necessary conditions and safeguards to
protect the occupants and the public.
   (E)   The administrative official shall maintain a record of all
certificates of occupancy, and a copy shall be furnished upon request to any
person. Failure to obtain a certificate of occupancy shall be a violation of
this chapter and is punishable under §
150.999.

members and must reside in the city. Not more than two of the members may be
citizen members of the Planning Commission. Board members shall be appointed by
the Mayor, subject to the approval of the City Council. The term of office

malfeasance, or conflict of interest. The Mayor shall submit a written
statement to the Commission setting forth the reasons for removal, and the
statement shall be read at the next meeting of the Board of Adjustment, which
shall be open to the general public. The member so removed shall have the right
of appeal from the removal of the circuit court of the county in which he or
she resides.
   (E)   Each Board of Adjustment annually shall elect a Chairperson, Vice-
Chairperson, and Secretary and any other officers it deems necessary, and any

(Prior Code, § 150.33) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.059 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT, QUORUM; MINUTES; BYLAWS.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall conduct meetings at the call of the
Chairperson who shall give written or oral notice to all members of the Board
at least seven days prior to the meeting, which notice shall contain the date,
time, and place for the meeting, be listed in the local paper at least seven
days in advance of a called meeting and a copy of the agenda be sent to the
Mayor and members of the City Council.
   (B)   A simple majority of the total membership of the Board of Adjustment
as established by regulation or agreement shall constitute a quorum. Any member
of a Board of Adjustment who has any direct or indirect financial interest in
the outcome of any question before the body shall disclose the nature of the
interest and shall disqualify himself or herself from voting on the question.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment shall adopt bylaws for the transaction of
business and shall keep minutes and records of all proceedings, including
regulations, transactions, findings, and determinations and the number of votes
for and against each question, and if any member is absent or abstains from
voting, indicating the fact, all of which shall, immediately after adoption be

general public. A transcript of a Board of Adjustment meeting shall be provided
if requested by a party, at the expense of the requesting party, and the
transcript shall constitute the record.
(Prior Code, § 150.34) (Ord. 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.060 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT, POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment may employ or contract with planners or other
persons as it deems necessary to accomplish its assigned duties under this
chapter.
   (B)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the right to receive, hold, and
spend funds which it may legally receive from any and every source in and out
of the commonwealth, including the United States government, for the purpose of
carrying out the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to issue subpoenas to
compel witnesses to attend its meetings and give evidence bearing upon the
questions before it. The sheriff shall serve such subpoenas. The circuit court
may, upon application by the Board, compel obedience to such court or such
subpoena by the proceedings of contempt.
   (D)   The Chairperson of the Board of Adjustment shall have the power to
administer an oath to witnesses prior to their testifying before the Board on
any issue.
   (E)   In exercising its duties, the Board may, as long as such action is in
conformity with the terms of this chapter reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and
may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be
made, and to that end shall have the powers of the administrative official from
whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of the three members of the Board
shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision, or
determination of the administrative official, or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter or
to effect any variation in the application of this chapter. For the purposes of
this chapter the Board has the following specific responsibilities in §§
150.061 through
150.064.
(Prior Code, § 150.35) (Ord. 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.061 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide application for
conditional use permits to allow the proper integration into the community of
uses which are specifically named in the zoning regulations which may be
suitable only in specific locations in the zone only if certain conditions are
met.
   (B)   The Board may approve, modify, or deny any application for a
conditional use permit. If it approves such permit it may attach necessary
conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more things be
done before the request can be initiated or conditions of a continuing nature.
Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board’s minutes and on the
conditional use permit along with a reference to the specific section in the
zoning regulation listing the conditional use under consideration. The Board
shall have power to revoke conditional use permits, or variances for
noncompliance with the condition thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have a
right of action to compel offending structures or uses removed at the cost of
the violator and may have judgment in personam for such cost.
   (C)   Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant
from complying with all of the requirements of building, housing, and other
regulations.
   (D)   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within the time limit set by the Board, or within one year, if no specific time
limit has been set, such conditional use permit shall not revert to its
original designation, unless there has been a public hearing. EXERCISED, as set
forth in this section, shall mean that bidding contracts for the construction
of the main building or other improvement has been let; or in the absence of
contracts that the main building or other improvement is under construction to
a substantial degree or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial
investment shall be under contract, in development, or completed. When
construction is not part of the use, “exercised” shall mean that the use is in
operation in compliance with the conditions set forth in this permit.
   (E)   The administrative official shall review all conditional use permits
except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least
once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where
the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is
complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use
permit. If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on
the conditional use permit, the administrative official shall report the fact
in writing to the Chairperson of the Board of Adjustment. The report shall
state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with
conditions on the conditional use permit and a copy of the report shall be
furnished to the landowner at the adjustment. The Board shall hold a hearing on
the report within a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one week prior to the
hearing. If the Board of Adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the report
of the administrative official are true and that the landowner has taken no
steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the
hearing, the Board of Adjustment may authorize the administrative official to
revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause
the termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit
authorizes.
   (F)   Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional use permit
and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely
and permanently satisfied, the administrative official, upon request of the
applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions
have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of the
conditional use permit which is on file. Thereafter said use, if it continues
to meet the other requirements of the regulations, will be treated as permitted
use.
(Prior Code, § 150.36) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.062 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board shall have the power to decide on applications for
variances. The Board may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions on
any variance it decides to grant.
   (B)   Findings necessary for granting variances: before any variance is
granted, the Board must consider the following, which shall be recorded along
with any imposed conditions or restrictions in its minutes and records and
issued in written form to the applicant to constitute proof of the variance;
whether:
      (1)   The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would
deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land or would create an
unnecessary hardship on the applicant;
      (2)   The variance arises from special circumstances which are not the
result of actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the
zoning regulation; and
      (3)   Reasons that the variance will not adversely affect the public
safety and welfare, and will not alter the essential character of the general
vicinity and will not cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public.
   (C)   Variance cannot contradict zoning regulation: the Board shall not
possess the power to grant a variance to permit a use of any land, building, or
structure which is not permitted by the zoning regulation in the zone in
question, or to alter density requirements in the zone in question.
   (D)   A variance applies to the property for which it is granted, and not
the individual who applied for it. A variance runs with the land and is
transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be transferred by
the applicant to a different site.
(Prior Code, § 150.37) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.063 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Intent. Within the districts established by this chapter (and
subsequent amendments) there exist lots, structures, and uses of lands and
structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the forms of this
chapter or future amendments. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue but not to allow their enlargement, expansion, or
extension.
   (B)   Existing nonconforming uses and structures, continuance, change. The
lawful use of a lot or structure, existing at the time of adoption of any
zoning regulations affecting it may be continued, although such use does not
conform to the provisions of such regulations, except as otherwise provided
herein. A nonconforming use may lapse for a period of one year, without being
considered abandoned. The property owner may appeal to the Board of Adjustment
for an additional year prior to the end of the first year. Any lapse of a
nonconforming use for a period of more than two years will result in the
property being required to conform to existing zoning requirements regarding
appropriate uses. The Board of Adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or
extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at
the time the regulation which makes it use nonconforming was adopted. Nor shall
the Board permit a change from one nonconforming use to another unless the new
nonconforming use is in the same or a more restrictive classification.
   (C)   Repairs and maintenance. Should any nonconforming structure or
nonconforming portion of a structure be damaged, destroyed, or demolished by
any means, it may be reconstructed or repaired but not to exceed the number of
cubic feet existing in it, and not to extend or enlarge the scope and area of
its operation prior to its damage, destruction, or demolition.
(Prior Code, § 150.38) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.064 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   (A)   Power of the Board. The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to
hear and decide cases where it is alleged by an applicant that there is error
in any order, requirement, decision, grant, or refusal made by an
administrative official in the enforcement of the zoning regulation. Such
appeal shall be within 30 days.
   (B)   Procedure for all appeals to Board. Appeals to the Board may be taken
by any person, or entity claiming to be injuriously affected or aggrieved by an
official action or decision of any zoning enforcement officer. Such appeal
shall be taken within 30 days after the appellant or his or her agent receives
official notice of the action, by filing with said officer and with the Board a
notice of appeal specifying the ground thereof, and giving notice of such
appeal to any and all parties of record. Said officer shall forthwith transmit
to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from was taken and shall be treated as and be the respondent in such further
proceedings. At the public hearing on the appeal held by the Board any
interested person may appear and enter his or her appearance, and all shall be
given an opportunity to be heard. The Board will rehear an appeal only in cases
where new evidence is available, or where the appealing person or entity
desires a complete transcription for the court record.
    (C)   Public notice of appeal hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable
time for hearing the appeal and give public notice in accordance with KRS
Chapter 424, as well as written notice to the appellant and the administrative
official at least one week prior to the hearing, and shall decide it within 60
days. The affected party may appear at the hearing in person or by attorney.
   (D)   Restraint of construction without permit. If no building permit has
been issued and a builder begins or continues to build, a restraining order may
be obtained upon application to the proper court of record and evidence of the
lack of a building permit shall establish a prima facie case for the issuance
of the restraining order.
   (E)   Appeals from the Board of Adjustment. Any person or entity claiming to
be injured or aggrieved by any final action of the Board of Adjustment shall
appeal from the action to the circuit court of the county in which the
property, which is the subject of the action of the Board of Adjustment, lies.
Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the final action of the Board.
All final actions which have not been appealed within 30 days shall not be
subject to judicial review. The Board of Adjustment shall be a party in any
such appeal filed in the circuit court.
(Prior Code, § 150.39) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.065 VIOLATIONS, APPEAL.
   (A)   Complaints regarding violations. Whenever a violation of this chapter
occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint
stating fully the causes and basis thereof, with the administrative official.
The administrative official shall record properly such complaint, immediately
investigate, and take action thereon as provided by this chapter.
   (B)   Violations regarding lots or parcels. Nothing herein contained shall
prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or
aggrieved by any final action of the Planning Commission shall appeal from the
final action to the circuit court of the county in which the property, which is
the subject of the Commission’s action, lies. Such appeal shall be taken within
30 days after such action. Such action shall not include the Commission’s
recommendations made to other governmental bodies. All final actions which have
not been appealed within 30 days shall not be subject to judicial review,
provided any appeal of a Planning Commission action granting or denying a
variance or conditional use permit authorized by KRS 100.203(5) shall be taken
pursuant to this division (B). In such case, the 30-day period for taking an
appeal begins to run at the time the legislative body grants or denies the map
amendment for the same development. The Planning Commission shall be a party in
any such appeal filed in the circuit court.
   (C)   Appeal. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the legislative body relating to a map amendment shall
appeal from the action to the circuit court of the county in which the
property, which is the subject of the map amendment, lies. Such appeal shall be
taken within 30 days after the final action of the legislative body. All final
actions which have not been appealed within 30 days shall not be subject to
judicial review. The legislative body shall be a party in such appeal filed in
the circuit court. Persons speaking at the public hearing in favor of the
decision being appealed are not required to be made parties to such appeal.
(Prior Code, § 150.40) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
AMENDMENTS
§ 150.080 PURPOSE.
   Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare, or good zoning
practices require, the legislative body may by ordinance after receiving a
recommendation thereon from the Planning Commission and subject to procedures
by law, amend, supplement, change, or repeal the regulations, restrictions, and
boundaries or classification of property.
(Prior Code, § 150.45) (Ord. FY 91-91, #2, passed 9-3-1991)
§ 150.081 APPLICATION FOR AMENDMENT.
   (A)   A proposal for amendment to the official zoning map may originate with
the Planning Commission, the City Council, any other government body, the owner
of the subject property, or by a person having written authorization from the
owner of the subject property. A proposal for amendment to the text of this
chapter may originate with the City Council or Planning Commission. Regardless
of the origin of the proposed amendment, an application must be filed with the
Planning Commission requesting the proposed amendment in such form and
accompanied by such information as required by this chapter and the Planning
Commission.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may require the submission of further
information subsequent to the filing of an application as provided by the
chapter and the Planning Commission. The submission of a development plan may
be required. If a development plan is approved, a certificate of land use
restriction must be filed. At the time of filing an application, a
nonreturnable filing fee shall be paid according to the schedule of fees,
however, there shall be no filing fee for an amendment requested by the City
Council, the Planning Commission, or any governmental agency. Notice of a
public hearing on the proposed amendment shall be given at least 14 days in
advance of the hearing by first class mail, with certification by the
Commission Secretary or other officer of the Planning Commission that the
notice was made to an owner of every parcel of property adjoining the property
the classification of which is proposed to be changed. It shall be the duty of
the person or persons proposing the amendment to furnish the Planning
Commission with correct names and addresses of all owners of adjoining
property. Records maintained by the Property Valuation Administrator may be
relied upon to determine the identity and address of said owner. In the event
such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, then the
person notified by mail shall be the President or Chairperson of the owner
group which administers property commonly owned by the condominium or
cooperative owners.

inappropriate and that the proposed zoning classification is appropriate; and
      (2)   (a)   There have been major changes of an economic, physical, or
social nature within the area involved which were not anticipated in the
adopted comprehensive plan and which have substantially altered the basic
character of such area.
(KRS 100.213)
         (b)   The findings of fact made by the Planning Commission shall be
recorded in the minutes and records of the Commission. After voting to
recommend that an application for amendment to the official zoning map be

APPENDIX B - HISTORIC DISTRICT GUIDELINES
   HISTORIC DISTRICT GUIDELINES
I.   BUILT ELEMENTS.
   (A)   New construction. The Commission’s review shall include consideration
of the following guidelines.
      (1)   Design. The design used for all new buildings within the historic
district(s) shall complement older architecture though sensitivity to height,
width, mass, proportion, materials, and texture.
      (2)   Building materials. New construction should utilize building
materials which complement those used in existing buildings in the area. The
simple use of color and building material in a new building generally will be
more compatible with existing buildings than the complex use of many colors and
building materials. A color palette will be available for reference.
      (3)   Relationship to site. A new building’s mass, placement, and
setbacks should be compatible with those of existing construction within the
historic district(s). The setback of the building should be compatible with its
neighbors.
      (4)   Height. The height of a new building should be compatible with the
heights of buildings in the surrounding area. New construction which either
greatly exceeds the average height of buildings in the area, or is too low,
such as a new one-story building in a block of two and one-half story
buildings, will be incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
      (5)   Width. A new building’s facade should complement the visual rhythms
that are common to the surrounding area or block in which the new building will
be located. Visual rhythm is established by a recurrence of the ratio between
building widths and the spaces between buildings.
   (B)   Exterior rehabilitation and maintenance. The Commission’s review shall
include consideration of the following guidelines.
      (1)   Original materials and architectural details should be retained
wherever possible. Retain corner boards, cornices, porches, and window and door
trim where appropriate to the original design. Early additions and alterations
should be considered for their own value and deserve due consideration as part
of the structure’s natural evolution.
      (2)   When original deteriorated architectural detailing must be
replaced, it is desirable to reproduce the detailing in the same material.
      (3)   False shutters, inappropriate window sash, and uncharacteristic
architectural details should not be added to an existing building. Shutters
should fit the window openings and should lie flat against the building.
      (4)   The original window and door openings should be retained. When
original windows and doors must be replaced, the replacements should be
characteristic of the building’s style and should fit the original opening in
the facade. Historic photographs should be referenced whenever possible.
      (5)   The original shape of an existing building roof should be
maintained. Do not install or enlarge dormers which would be incompatible with
the building’s facade.
      (6)   Materials used in the exterior renovation of a building should be
compatible with the building’s original materials. Artificial siding and false
facades should not be applied to older buildings because they mask original
building materials and architectural details and may damage the structure.
      (7)   When the exterior masonry of a building must be repaired, the color
and composition of the masonry and the composition, color and tooling of the
mortar should duplicate the original.
      (8)   New additions to existing buildings should relate their materials,
texture and scale to the buildings to which they are being added. New additions
should not necessarily duplicate the design details of the older building. A
contemporary design sympathetic to the existing building is equally desirable.
   (C)   Demolition. The Commission shall consider the following factors when
considering the demolition of a building in a historic district:
      (1)   The importance of the building to the history and character of the
district;
      (2)   The physical condition of the building;
      (3)   The costs of renovation of the building; and
      (4)   The existing and/or potential usefulness of the building including
the potential economic return from the building.

Appendix B, Illustrations
II.   THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR’S STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION.
   The Commission shall refer to the following standards for general guidance
in reviewing plans for rehabilitation, preservation, and the continued use of
the historic buildings in the local historic district(s).
   (A)   Provide a compatible use. Every reasonable effort shall be made to
provide a compatible use for a property which requires minimal alteration of
the building, structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for
its originally intended purpose.
   (B)   Preserve original qualities. The distinguishing original qualities or
character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be
destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
   (C)   Recognize the building as a product of its own time. All buildings,
structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time.
Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier
appearance shall be discouraged.
   (D)   Recognize and respect historic alterations. Changes which may have
taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development
of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have
acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
   (E)   Treat distinctive features sensitively. Distinctive stylistic features
or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure,
or site shall be treated with sensitivity.
   (F)   Repair rather than replace. Deteriorated architectural features shall
be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement
is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (G)   Do not sandblast. The surface cleaning of structures shall be
undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning
methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
   (H)   Preserve archeological resources. Every reasonable effort shall be
made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by, or adjacent
to any project.
   (I)   Modern additions should be compatible with the original. Contemporary
design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be
discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant
historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible
with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property,
neighborhood, or environment.
   (J)   Alterations should not permanently change the original. Wherever
possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a
manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future,
the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired.
III.    LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS.
   (A)   Paving.
      (1)   Ground cover and planting. If an area exists between the sidewalk
and the building, this area shall be planted with ground cover and planting. In
no case shall this area be used for direct parking from the street into parking
spaces in front of the building.
      (2)   Parking spaces. Parking shall be located behind or to the side of
commercial structures and shall not be allowed in front of the building.
      (3)   Curb area. The space between the curb and the sidewalk, if any,
shall be planted with ground cover or paved with an approved material.
      (4)   Parking lots. Areas exposed to public street traffic, used for
parking, shall be landscaped with ground cover and plantings. Plans shall be
submitted to the Commission for approval. Any existing parking lots or parking
areas shall be landscaped according to this condition if there is any new
construction or repaving of the lot or area.
   (B)   Plantings and trees.
      (1)   In all cases of new construction, a complete landscape plan shall
be submitted as part of the proposal for review.
      (2)   The removal of any tree with a trunk diameter of greater than four
inches must be approved by the Commission.
   (C)   Bridges. Original materials and design elements shall be retained
whenever possible. When replacement of materials and lighting is necessary, new
materials that are characteristic and sensitive shall be considered
appropriate.
IV.   SIGNS.
   The Historic District Commission shall refer to A Guide to Better Signs,
Department of Development, Halifax, Nova Scotia, for examples of sign types,
lettering faces and overall designs.
   (A)   Definitions.
      (1)   The following terms, as used in this guide, are hereby defined as

design, or directional sign used for advertising purposes, whether painted
upon, attached to, erected on, or otherwise maintained on any premises,
containing any words, letters, figures, numerals, phrases, sentences, emblems,
devices, trade names, or trade marks by which anything is made known, such as
are used to designate an individual, a firm, an association, a corporation, a
professional, a business, a commodity or product, which is visible from any
public thoroughfare and is used to attract attention.
      (2)   Signs in legal existence on the effective date of these guidelines
not in conformity with these guidelines, may remain in place. Only routine
maintenance may be performed on the sign and its structure until such time as
the sign is brought into conformance with these regulations. If a business is
moved or abandoned, all nonconforming signs shall be removed within 30 days.
   (B)   General.
      (1)   General prohibition of miscellaneous signs. The display of signs of
a miscellaneous character visible from public thoroughfares within a historic

construction should relate to the appearance, color, size, position, method of
attachment, texture, and design of the district.
      (3)   What signs may advertise. No sign of any character shall be

business conducted in or on the premises. Not more than 50% of the area of such
signs may be used to advertise products or commodities actually sold on the
premises.
      (4)   Number of signs allowed. One sign only shall be allowed to each
store, shop, or bona fide place of business, and this sign shall be no larger
than the maximum stipulated in the guide regardless of front footage of the
property, unless otherwise permitted herein.
      (5)   Prohibited sign placement. No sign shall be placed in any manner
whatsoever so as to disfigure or conceal any architectural feature or detail of
any building. No sign shall be displayed from any fence, wall, or open lot
unless it conforms in proportion to the allowable area and does not exceed the
maximum.
      (6)   Awnings. Awnings shall be mounted on fixed or movable frames and be
securely attached to the building and shall not overwhelm the building or
streetscape and conform in size to the opening beneath.

require approval of the Historic District Commission.
      (11)   Special considerations. The Historic District Commission may give
special consideration where it deems it an appropriate exception, including,
but not limited to, the following: historic markings; monuments; cinemas or
theaters; and service stations.
      (12)   Sign removal.
         (a)   It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property to
cause any and all signs to be removed from the property, that are void because
of the closing, moving, or termination of a business at the said property.
         (b)   Change of occupancy of the building requiring the installation

      (3)   Two or more businesses in a single premises. In the case where two
or more businesses are conducted on the premises of a single ownership the sign
area may be allotted proportionally to the businesses. Businesses fronting on
parallel streets may use sign allowances as listed on each street if each
frontage is considered a major traffic entrance. In case of more than one
business operation with distinctive separate entrances more than one sign will
be permitted but must be within the total allotted sign footage area, however,
consideration will be given for additional footage if conditions warrant.
      (4)   Temporary window signs. Temporary window signs may be allowed if
they advertise special sales or events lasting no more than 15 days. They shall

(schools, churches, and the like).
      (1)   Freestanding signs shall not exceed a height of five feet above the
grade at location of the sign and shall be no closer than ten feet to the

§ 151.19 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE, HEARING, AND APPEAL.
   The following procedures shall be followed with regard to the issuance of
complaints, the conducting of hearings, and the manner of appealing orders
entered pursuant hereto.
   (A)   Whenever a petition is filed with the City Building Inspector by at
least three residents of the city charging that any structure is unfit and
unsafe for human habitation, occupancy, or use, or whenever it appears to the
City Building Inspector that any structure is unfit and unsafe for human
habitation, occupancy or use, or whenever said petition alleges or it appears
to the City Building Inspector that conditions exist in the structure which are
dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the occupants of the
structure, the occupants of neighboring structures, or other residents of the
city, the City Building Inspector shall, if his or her preliminary
investigation discloses a basis for such allegation, issue and cause to be
served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such structure a complaint
stating the allegations in that respect.
   (B)   The complaint shall state that a hearing will be held before the Board
of Housing Appeals at a place fixed in the complaint not less than ten days nor
more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint; that the owner and
parties in interest may file an answer to the complaint and appear in person,
or otherwise, and give testimony at the time and place stated in the complaint;
and that the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure shall not be controlling to the
hearing.
   (C)   If, after the notice and hearing, the Board of Housing Appeals
determines that the structure under consideration is unfit and unsafe for human
habitation, occupancy, or use, or that conditions exist in the structure which
are dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the occupants of the
structure, the occupants of neighboring structures, or other residents of the
city, according to this chapter of the city’s code of ordinances or in the
State Building Code as promulgated in 815 KAR 7:120 by the state’s Board of
Housing, Buildings and Construction, as appropriate, it shall state in writing
its findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause
to be served upon the owner thereof an order requiring the owner, within the
time specified:
      (1)   To repair, alter, or improve the structure to render it fit for
human habitation, occupancy, or use, or, at the option of the owner, to vacate,
demolish, and remove the structure; or
      (2)   To remove or demolish the structure, if the removal or demolition
is deemed necessary by the Board of Housing Appeals.
   (D)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or
improve or, at the option of the owner, to vacate, demolish, and remove the
structure, the City Building Inspector may cause the structure to be repaired,
altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed. The City Building Inspector
may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any structure so closed, a
placard with the following words: “This building is unfit and unsafe for human
habitation, occupancy or use; the use or occupation of this building for human
habitation, occupancy, or use is prohibited and unlawful.”
   (E)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the
structure, the City Building Inspector may cause such structure to be removed
or demolished; provided, however, that if the city hires an independent
contractor to perform the removal or demolition, such contractor shall supply
the city with proof of good and sufficient insurance to cover any damages to
persons or property which might result from the removal or demolition and
provided that the contractor shall sign a written agreement indemnifying and
holding the city harmless from any and all liability whatsoever resulting from
the contractor’s actions.
   (F)   The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations, or improvements, or of
vacating and closing, or of removal or demolition shall be a lien upon the real
property upon which the cost was incurred. If the structure is removed or
demolished by the City Building Inspector or at his or her direction, he or she
shall sell the materials of the structure remaining thereafter and shall credit
the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal or demolition. Any
balance remaining shall be deposited in a trust fund by the City Building
Inspector, until such time as the identity of the proper persons who are
entitled thereto may be ascertained, at which point the City Building Inspector
shall disburse the proceeds to those persons.
   (G)   The City Building Inspector shall execute a written affidavit which
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the lien provided for in
division (F) of this section, and the regularity of the proceedings pursuant to
this section and to KRS 65.8840 and shall record same in the real property
records in the office of the Bell County Court Clerk. The lien shall be notice
to all persons from the time of its recording and shall bear interest at the
maximum legal interest rate set forth in KRS 360.010 thereafter until paid. The
lien created shall take precedence over all other subsequent liens, except
state, county, school board, and city taxes, and may be enforced by judicial
proceedings instituted by the city, in which case the owner shall also be
liable for any and all costs incurred in the process of collection of the
amount secured by the lien, including court costs and a reasonable attorney
fee. In addition, the owner of a property upon which a lien has been attached
pursuant hereto shall be personally liable for the amount of the lien,
including all interest, civil penalties, and other charges, including costs of
collection, court costs and a reasonable attorney fee, and the city may bring a
civil action against the owner and shall have the same remedies as provided for
the recovery of a debt owed.
   (H)   When the City Building Inspector has condemned as unfit and unsafe for
human habitation, occupancy, or use, any structure in accordance with this
chapter and has ordered same to be vacated, the City Building Inspector may,
upon ten days’ written notice to the occupants, apply to Bell District Court
for an order of eviction directing the sheriff to remove the occupants and
their belongings from the structure.
   (I)   Complaints or orders issued by the City Building Inspector or Board of
Housing Appeals, as applicable, pursuant to this chapter shall be served upon
persons either personally or by certified mail; however, if the whereabouts of
such person are unknown and cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, or if the person is so conducting himself or herself as to avoid
service personally or by certified mail, and the City Building Inspector makes
an affidavit to that effect, service of such complaint or order shall be by
newspaper publication for three successive weeks pursuant to KRS Chapter 424. A
copy of such complaint or order shall also be posted in a conspicuous place on
the premises affected by the complaint or order, and shall be recorded in the
real property records in the office of the Bell County Court Clerk.
   (J)   Any person affected by an order issued by the Board of Housing
Appeals, may, within three days after the posting and service of the order,
petition the Bell Circuit Court for an injunction restraining the City Building
Inspector pending the final disposition of the cause. Hearings shall be had by
the court on such petition within 20 days, or as soon thereafter as possible.
In all such proceedings the findings of the Board of Housing Appeals as to
facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT,
PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES
§ 156.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in the Kentucky Revised
Statutes Chapter 100 delegated to local governmental units the authority to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the City of Middlesboro,
Kentucky, has ordained the following provisions.
(Prior Code, § 156.01) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Prior Code, § 156.02) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Prior Code, § 156.03) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.004 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize flood blight areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in
a special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   To ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Prior Code, § 156.04) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
DEFINITIONS
§ 156.015 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A ZONES, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations, and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   A1-30 AND AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood), base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   A99 ZONE. That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.   
   ADDITION TO AN EXISTING BUILDING. Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is
connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls is new construction.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/AL - A30, AR/AE, AR/ALL, AR/AO, AND AR/A ZONES. Special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) that result from the decertification of a previously accredited
flood protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a
100-year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete
these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding
sources.    
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO Zone on a community’s flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, there
is no clearly defined channel the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized
by ponding or sheet flow.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year (also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD). BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate
map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and A1/AO that
indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1% or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally above ground,
including a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other human-
made facilities or infrastructures. See definition for STRUCTURE.

floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety,
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular
program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not
limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to
avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and
equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.

commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMS effective before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to
as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to affixed (including at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management chapter adopted by the city based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site

of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See MUDSLIDE.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See FLOOD-
RELATED EROSION.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.      
   FLOOD HAZARD/BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the flood
mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAY (FIRM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing
flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), and/or the flood boundary
floodway map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by flood waters from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state, and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOOD-PROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOOD-PROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a nonresidential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyance and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
156.072, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city, will
consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to government
responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years.
Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation
are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods,
while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to
all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood
damages may incur in addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware
that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very
high flood insurance rates.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY. A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water includes only a docking or port
facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs than have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). Provides for the payment of a claim for
the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws or
ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by a
standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or
community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, flood-proof, demolish,
or remove the building. ICC coverage is available on residential and
nonresidential buildings (this category includes public or government
buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under
the NFIP.
   KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE 151.250 (KRS 151.250). Plans for dams, levees, and
the like to be approved and permit issued by the Cabinet (Environmental and
Public Protection Cabinet).
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county, or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation, or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill, or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction, or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the Cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the Cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments,
or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to require approval
by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.       
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier, or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the Cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (1) of this definition.
      (3)   Nothing in this definition is intended to give the Cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance, or operation of any drainage district, ditch, or
system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the
same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by
the Cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water
resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control
thereof so notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter
350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the
regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other
obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which
structures are permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining
operations.

floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs include the following
categories.
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA
amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a SFHA.   
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION - FILL (LOMR-F). A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   LEVEE. A human-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM.
      (1)   A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
      (2)   For a LEVEE SYSTEM to be recognized, the following criteria must be
met:
         (a)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised);
and
         (b)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or
state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a
community participating in the NFIP.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support,
or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion
of construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or
landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure’s foundation
system.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, structure access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a structure’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation, when connected to the required utilities. The term also
includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures
placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved
property. The term MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.

(FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter
suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.
(The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL). The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on a community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of
disaster response and recovery.
   MUDSLIDE (I.E., MUDFLOW). Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a
dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water
on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (I.E., MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (I.E., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   MUDSLIDE (I.E., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA. An area with land surfaces and slopes
of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, is a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRMs. Refer to
FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the “start of construction” commenced
on or after the effective date of the city’s floodplain management regulations
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured home are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the city’s ordinance on floodplain management regulations.
   NONRESIDENTIAL. Structures that are not designed for human habitation,
including, but is not limited to, small business concerns, churches, schools,
farm structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses,
recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial
structures, warehouses, and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less
than six months duration.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD). As corrected in 1988, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRM’s and digitally referenced FIRMs
(DFIRMs). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, embankment,

   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) for Bell County,
dated March 16, 2015, with the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMS),
other supporting data, and any subsequent amendments thereto, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations by the
city, and for those land areas acquired by the city through annexation. This
FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this section
and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation
of this section and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain
Administrator and are enacted by City Council pursuant to statutes governing

§ 156.037 ENFORCEMENT AND NOTICE.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil violation.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this ordinance or with
the approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur,
which period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature
of the violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy
may include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also
state that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested
remedies and corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a
civil monetary fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed.
See §
156.999.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedies to bring the development into

ADMINISTRATION
§ 156.050 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The city hereby appoints the Floodplain Administrator to administer,
implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting or denying
development permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein referred
to as the Floodplain Administrator.
(Prior Code, § 156.25) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.051 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
156.031. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the nonresidential flood-proofed structure will meet
the flood-proofing criteria in §§
156.066(B) through
156.068; and
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood- proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
Zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood-
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
(Prior Code, § 156.26) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,

         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner; and
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, ADVERSELY
AFFECTS means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
156.031, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer §§

boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
156.072;
         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
156.031, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
156.065 through
156.071;

      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (B)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the Variance Board need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Variance Board
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in §
156.015); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
156.015 under PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions are satisfied and that
the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to
public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
   (C)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the Bell County Court Clerk and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land; and
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (D)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (E)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydronamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effect of
buoyance.
   (B)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
   (F)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (G)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
   (H)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
   (I)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (J)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a building
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the
requirements of “new construction” as contained in this chapter.
   (K)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a building
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall be
undertaken only if said nonconformity is not furthered, extended, or replaced.
(Prior Code, § 156.30) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.066 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have
been provided, as set forth in §§
156.031 or
156.052, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement elevated, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
at or above base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of
division (C) of this section:
      (1)   In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified;
      (2)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated at or above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be produced.
Title 401 KAR 60:005 states as a part of the technical requirements for a state
floodplain permit: “The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining
floodway boundaries (and thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed
construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall
be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no
more than + 0.5 foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points
which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific sit elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations; and
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated at or above the base flood elevation.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor
including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
surveyor, and verified by the Community Building Inspection Department to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure
(including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (B)(1) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be flood-proofed below an elevation at or above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than at or above base flood elevation;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
156.051(A)(3);
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) of this
section; and
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below
the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this
requirement must meet or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to an elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed
on sites located within A, A-1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels;
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood.
         (b)   All manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than at or above the
level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than at or above the level of the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes.
         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the state’s motor vehicle regulations,
is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
156.031, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; and
      (2)   If this division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
156.030 through
156.036.
   (F)   Standards for utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
         (a)   Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
         (b)   Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
      (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them, or contamination from them during flooding.
(Prior Code, § 156.31) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.067 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §§
156.031, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The
engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms
to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be
elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
156.052.
(Prior Code, § 156.32) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.068 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
156.031, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply.
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the flood insurance rate map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
flood insurance rate map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade; and
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely flood-proofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
156.066(C).
(Prior Code, § 156.33) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.069 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards;
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available
(Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is
the lesser, shall be provided; and
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood
elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Prior Code, § 156.34) (Ord. 92-93, #17, passed 5-4-1993; Ord. 06-07, #4,
passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.070 STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE
LETTER “A”.
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated “A”
the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Structure must be non-habitable;
   (B)   Must be anchored to resist flotation forces;
   (C)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one foot above grade,
total openings are to be one square inch per one square foot of floor area, at
least two openings required on opposite walls;
   (D)   Built of flood resistant materials below the base flood elevation;
   (E)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;
   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking; and
   (G)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.
(Prior Code, § 156.35) (Ord. 06-07, #4, passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.071 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of the base flood
elevation at the site. Flood-proofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the Floodplain Administrator to help protect its
citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the
cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that
variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain
multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted.
The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The city shall establish an
Appeal Board consisting of five people.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Bell County Circuit Court as provided
in state statutes.
(Prior Code, § 156.36) (Ord. 06-07, #4, passed 9-19-2006)
§ 156.072 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Applications. In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (B)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the Variance Board need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Variance Board
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
156.015 under PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions are satisfied and that
the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to
public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
   (C)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the Bell County Court Clerk and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land; and
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (D)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination

(Prior Code, § 160.36)
§ 160.37 PROCEDURE FOR DESIGNATION OF A LANDMARK OR HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   (A)   Consideration of the designation of a landmark, landmark site, or
historic district may be originated by the Commission, or by the filing of an
application for designation by a property owner, any resident of the city, or
any organization in the city. A person or an organization proposing a
designation shall give the Commission the names and addresses of the owners of
the affected property and the owners of all adjoining property as listed on the
tax rolls of the city.
   (B)   The Commission shall assemble information about a property or district
being considered for designation, and shall schedule a public hearing on the
proposed designation. Advertised notice of the hearing shall be given,
including conspicuous posting on the property or in the proposed district. At
least 15 days prior to the public hearing, written notice shall be given by the
owners of all adjoining property. Written notice shall be considered sufficient
when it is mailed to the person listed on the tax rolls of the city.
   (C)   Before its first public hearing on a designation, the Commission shall
adopt general guidelines that will apply to the city’s landmarks and historic
districts, and will assist owners in the preservation and rehabilitation of
their property. The general guidelines shall include the Secretary of the
Interior’s standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating
historic buildings, and other guidelines that will apply to all designated
property in the city. Before each public hearing on a designation, the
Commission may adopt additional guidelines that will supplement the general
guidelines and will apply to the property under consideration if it is
designated. The guidelines shall not limit new construction to any one
architectural style, but shall seek to preserve the character and integrity of
the landmark or the historic district. The guidelines shall suggest changes
that would be appropriate for landmarks or for property in historic districts.
After a designation, the Commission may expand or amend the guidelines it has
adopted, provided it holds a public hearing on the changes and submits the
proposed changes to the City Council for its comments.
   (D)   After evaluating the testimony at its public hearing, survey
information, and other material it has assembled, the Commission shall make its
recommendation to the City Council with a written report on the property or
area under consideration. The report shall contain information about structures
and significant landscape components which have been identified for inclusion
in the proposed designation.
   (E)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall then report on the
relationship between the proposed designation, and existing and future plans
for the development of the city.
      (1)   If the Planning and Zoning Commission approves of the proposed
designation, it shall amend the comprehensive plan to include the proposed
designation, and shall recommend a change in the zoning map to show the
proposed historic designation. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward
its comments, the comprehensive plan amendment, and the zoning map change to
the City Council.
      (2)   If the Planning and Zoning Commission does not approve of the
proposed designation, it shall forward its comments to the City Council.
   (F)   The City Council shall approve, modify, or disapprove the proposed
designation within 60 days after receiving the recommendation of the Commission
and the material from the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the City Council
decides to make a designation and no comprehensive plan amendment has been
adopted and no zoning map change has been recommended, the City Council shall
request the Planning and Zoning Commission to reconsider its earlier decisions,
and shall provide that the designation shall take effect after these
preliminary steps have been approved.
   (G)   The Commission shall notify each owner of the decision relating to his
or her property, and shall arrange that the designation of a property as a
landmark or as a part of a historic district be recorded in the land records of
the county and upon the official city zoning map. The Commission shall ask that
fees be waived for the city documents recording the designations. The
Commission shall also give notice of the decision to the government offices in
the city and county, which shall retain them for future reference.
   (H)   The amendment or rescission of any designation shall be accomplished
through the same steps as were followed in the original designation.

160.99
§ 160.51 APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE; STOP WORK ORDER.

from the applicant.
      (1)   The applicant shall provide, where applicable, drawings of the
proposed work, photographs of the existing building, structure, or site and
adjacent properties, and information about the building materials to be used.
      (2)   In the event work is being performed without the required
certificate of appropriateness, the Commission will see that a stop work order
is issued. In the event work is being performed which is not in accordance with
the certificate, the Building Inspector or the City Clerk shall issue a stop
work order, and any law enforcement officer may cite violators in district
court.
         (a)   All work shall cease on the designated property. No additional
work shall be undertaken as long as the stop work order shall continue in

cut down a designated tree or a tree on designated property that is visible to
the public, that person shall apply directly to the Commission for a

with the certificate, the Police Chief or the City Clerk shall issue a stop
work order, and any law enforcement officer may cite violators to district
court.
      (2)   All work shall cease on the designated property. No additional work
shall be undertaken as long as the stop work order shall continue in effect.

(Prior Code, § 160.26) Penalty, see §
160.99
§ 160.52 HEARING ON CERTIFICATE.
   (A)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing on each certificate of
appropriateness within 30 days after a completed application is received by the
Commission. The Commission shall make a decision on the application within 45
days after the receipt of a completed application, provided that the Commission
may extend the time for decision an additional 60 days when the application is
for demolition or new construction.
   (B)   The Commission shall approve or disapprove each application, and it
shall give its reasons for its decision, using the criteria contained in this
chapter and in its guidelines.
   (C)   The Commission may suggest modifications to an application, and may
then approve a certificate of appropriateness providing for revisions in the
plans submitted.
(Prior Code, § 160.27)
§ 160.53 DECISION OF COMMISSION.
   (A)   If the Commission fails to decide on an application within the
specified time period, the application shall be deemed approved. Applicants
shall be given notice of the public hearings and meetings relating to their
application, and shall be informed of the Commission’s decision. Advertised
notice of the hearing shall be given, including conspicuous posting on the
property.
   (B)   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall use the
general guidelines, and the guidelines it has adopted for that landmark or
historic district.
      (1)   The Commission shall consider the following:
         (a)   The effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the property
upon which the work is to be done; and
         (b)   The relationship between the work and other structures on the
landmark site, or other property in the historic district.
      (2)   In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the Commission shall
consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style,
design, arrangement, texture, materials, and color.
      (3)   The certificate from the Commission shall not relieve the property
owner from complying with the requirements of other state and local laws and
regulations.
   (C)   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall be aware
of the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the applicant.
The Commission shall also recognize the importance of approving plans that will
be reasonable for the applicant to carry out. Before an applicant prepares his
or her plans, he or she may bring a tentative proposal to the Commission for
its comments. The Commission shall prepare a list of routine alterations that
shall receive immediate approval without a public hearing when an applicant
complies with the specifications of the Commission. The list shall include
paint colors appropriate for different types of buildings.
   (D)   In reviewing applications involving signs, the Commission shall use
guidelines it has prepared that have been approved by the City Council. Owners
and tenants shall apply to the Commission before their signs are made.
(Prior Code, § 160.28)
§ 160.54 ALTERNATIVES TO DEMOLITION TO BE SOUGHT.
   (A)   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark, a building or
structure on a landmark site, or a building or structure in a historic
district, the Commission shall negotiate with the applicant to see if an
alternative to demolition can be found.
   (B)   The Commission may ask interested individuals and organizations for
assistance in seeking an alternative to demolition and in obtaining estimates
on rehabilitation costs for the threatened building.
   (C)   After its public hearing, the Commission may decide that a building or
structure in a historic district or on a landmark site may be demolished
because it does not contribute to the historic district or to the landmark.
   (D)   On all other demolition applications, the Commission shall study the
question of economic hardship for the applicant, and shall determine whether
