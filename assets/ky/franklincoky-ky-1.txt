§ 30.055 METHODS FOR FILLING VACANCIES.
   (A)   Promotions. In considering the filling of a vacancy, current employees
who meet job requirements shall be considered for the position. If the County
Judge/Executive determines the needs of the county are best served by
employment of external candidates, he or she may recommend the appointment to
Fiscal Court that is in the county’s best interest.
   (B)   Transfers.
      (1)   The county may fill vacancies by transferring any current employee;
provided that, the employee meets or exceeds the job requirements for the
position(s) they are being transferred to. The Fiscal Court shall be notified
contemporaneously of any transfer to which position the employee is being
transferred to.
      (2)   Transfer requests from employees will be treated like applications
for employment in that the county will select the most qualified individual to
fill the vacancy. Personnel who have requested transfer to vacant positions
within the county will also have to compete with applicants who have applied
for the vacant position. Additionally, the County Judge/Executive will ensure
that any transfer granted will be in the best interest of the county and will
not have an adverse affect on the losing department.
   (C)   Open application policy. The county shall accept applications for
employment at any time during regular business hours. Current employees may
apply for vacant positions within the county; provided, they meet the
qualifications requested by the hiring authority. If the County Judge/Executive
determines that a new hire is in the best interest of the county, he or she may
advertise to fill the vacancy and select the most qualified candidate from the
applications received. If an individual is not selected for whatever reason,
his or her application will be maintained on file with the Fiscal Court for six
months. Should a situation arise where the County Judge/Executive needs to fill
a vacancy, those applications on file can be used to select an individual to
fill a vacant position; provided, the applicant is qualified for the position.
   (D)   Recruitment. If determined by the County Judge/Executive that it would
be in the best interest of the county to obtain a larger pool of candidates for
a position opening, the County Judge/Executive may simultaneously post position
openings internally as well as advertise publicly. Any such public recruitment
shall be in accordance with §
30.056 of this chapter.
   (E)   Hiring list.
      (1)   To address vacancies which may arise in the County Fire Department,
the county shall maintain a Fire Department hiring list containing the eligible
candidates. Eligibility shall be based upon uniform testing scores obtained
from the Fire Department test, which shall be administered annually and no
later than October 1, or as soon as practical thereafter.
      (2)   The list shall be maintained for a period of 12 months, unless
approval by the County Judge/Executive is granted for an extension. In the
event a candidate is unavailable, the list is insufficient or other needs arise
which require testing, the Department shall permit additional testing for
candidates, with the approval of the Judge/Executive and notice to the Fiscal
Court.
   (F)   Temporary, part-time employee. In the event an emergency situation
arises, the County Judge/Executive may hire a part-time employee on a temporary
basis until the situation has been resolved. The Fiscal Court shall be notified
contemporaneously of the new hire.
   (G)   Applications reviewed.
      (1)   Applications for part-time, temporary or seasonal park employees
shall be reviewed by the Park Director and Human Resources Director.
      (2)    If applicants are qualified for the vacant position(s), funding is
available in the budget, and the Park Director and Human Resources Director
both agree to offer the applicant employment, they may be hired at that time,
pending results of division (4) below. A list of each hire, their application
and background check must be presented to Fiscal Court at the next scheduled
meeting for ratification.
      (3)   The maximum number of eligible part-time, temporary or seasonal
park employees shall not be limited to a maximum number of positions due to
scheduling requirements.

notified of reinstatement verbally to return to work, the county shall follow-
up in writing within 24 hours.

contemporaneously with the notice of the suspension.
      (4)   Pre-termination (dismissal) conference. An employee who has been

intent to dismiss.
         (d)   Within five working days, excluding the day of the pre-
termination conference, the County Judge/Executive shall uphold, alter, modify
or rescind the intended dismissal. The employee will be notified in writing of
the County Judge/Executive’s decision and the reasons for it.
         (e)   Such action shall be recorded in the employee’s personnel file.
      (5)   Dismissal.
         (a)   Where minor offenses are continually repeated, or misconduct is
serious enough for discharge on the first offense, the department head may

dismissal, details of previous disciplinary action taken against the employee
and the recommended effective date and time of dismissal.

      (1)   The County Fiscal Court (FCFC) is committed to protecting the
safety, health and well- being of all employees and other individuals in our
workplace. FCFC recognizes that alcohol abuse and drug use pose a significant
threat to county goals. In the interest of assuring the safety of the general
public by employing persons in safety sensitive positions that do not abuse
illicit substances, illegal drugs and alcohol, this drug-free workplace policy
establishes the balance of respect for individuals with the need to maintain an
alcohol- and drug-free environment.
      (2)   Likewise, it is FCFC’s additional purpose(s) and intent to
accomplish the following with the establishment of this policy:
         (a)   To comply with all requirements of 803 KAR 25:280 regarding the
establishment and maintenance of a drug-free workplace for the purposes of
obtaining certification from the Department of Worker’s Claims;
         (b)   As a recipient of federal funds, to comply with the Drug-Free
Workplace Act of 1988 (Pub. Law No. 100-690, Title V, Schedule D, being 41
U.S.C. Chapter 81);
         (c)   To comply with the Federal Department of Transportation
regulations regarding employees holding commercial driver’s licenses (CDL);
         (d)   To reduce the number of accidents and injuries to employees,
other persons and property;
         (e)   To reduce absenteeism and tardiness and to increase the
productivity of all employees of the county; and
         (f)   To help ensure that the reputation of FCFC as a whole and of the
employees throughout the community.
      (3)   It is with these stated goals in mind that the County Fiscal Court
issues this policy, declaring itself a drug- and alcohol-free workplace and
hereby issues these accompanying rules regarding drug and alcohol use in the

subject to pre-employment drug testing. It also applies to all FCFC employees
with special provisions designated to those employees identified as holding
safety sensitive positions.
   (E)   Policy requirements.
      (1)   Training. The County Fiscal Court shall conduct substance abuse
awareness training for all employees. This substance abuse awareness training
shall consist of the following minimum requirements.
         (a)   Upon a conditional offer of employment from the county, each
applicant shall be provided a copy of and will be asked to read the Court’s
drug- and alcohol-free workplace policy. All current employees will also be
asked to read the drug- and alcohol-free workplace policy and sign the
certification of acknowledgment - drug- and alcohol-free workplace policies and
procedures form.
         (b)   Initial training shall consist of at least one hour for all
employees.
         (c)   Annual refresher training shall be conducted for all employees
in substance abuse awareness and shall consist of no less than 30 minutes.
         (d)   All alcohol and substance abuse awareness training shall
include, at a minimum, information concerning:
            1.   Alcohol and drug testing policy and procedures; effects of
alcohol and drug use on an individual’s health, work and personal life;
            2.   Disease of alcohol or drug addiction;
            3.   Signs and symptoms of an alcohol and drug problem;
            4.   Role of co-workers and supervisors in addressing alcohol or

            3.   How to refer employees to the employee assistance program or
other alcohol and substance abuse treatment program; and
            4.   Legal and practical aspects of reasonable suspicion testing
for the presence of drugs and alcohol.
         (f)   Note: should any portion of this policy dealing with the actual
administration of this policy be amended, employees shall be provided with
copies of any administrative change or modification and given an opportunity to
ask questions and obtain answers regarding any administrative change(s) in this
policy. However, changes may not be made to the policy that would circumvent
any requirements associated with 803 KAR 25:280.
      (2)   Drug and alcohol testing.
         (a)   The county currently utilizes the drug testing company
contracted by the county as its laboratory of choice for the collection of
urine samples in the case of testing for controlled substances, and for the
administration of breathalyzer tests for alcohol concentration. The drug
testing facility is also the county’s third-party administrator of choice for
the random selection category of testing.
         (b)   Employees are selected by the drug testing company using a
statistically valid method of selection of specific employee codes. This random
testing will be reasonably spaced over a 12-month period. Because of the random
nature of the selection process, any employee may be tested more than once, or
not at all. Once collected, all urine samples are forwarded for analysis to a
testing facility contracted by the county’s drug testing company, which is a
laboratory approved by the National Laboratory Certification Program (NLCP)
under the United States Department of Health and Mental Services Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
         (c)   The county shall administer alcohol and drug tests in
circumstances which include, but may not be limited to, the following.
            1.   Pre-employment testing.
               a.   Breath alcohol and urine drug testing shall be required of
all new hire applicants after their receipt of a conditional offer of
employment. After receiving the conditional offer of employment, applicants
will have 24 hours in which to submit to testing at a testing facility of
FCFC’s choosing. The FCFC requires that every newly hired employee test free of
controlled substances and have a breath alcohol concentration of not more than
zero. Each offer of employment by FCFC shall be conditional upon the passing of
controlled substance and alcohol tests.
               b.   Refusal by any applicant for employment with FCFC to take
the controlled substance test will result in the conditional offer of
employment being withdrawn. All testing under this policy will be in accordance
with testing protocols described elsewhere in this policy.
                  i.   Any applicant with a confirmed positive test for
controlled substances and/or breath alcohol in a concentration of 0.02 or
greater which is not legitimately explained to and accepted by a medical review
officer, will not be considered for employment.
                  ii.   Any applicant who fails a controlled substance or
breath alcohol test may not be considered for future employment with FCFC.
                  iii.   Any applicant who refuses to take a controlled
substance or breath alcohol test will be disqualified from future consideration
for employment.
                  iv.   Any applicant who tampers with, or attempts to tamper
with, a urine specimen in any manner shall be disqualified from current and
future consideration of employment with the FCFC.
                  v.   Any applicant whose positive test is confirmed and
upheld by the medical review officer (MRO) may request that the same sample be
retested at her or his own expense at a FCFC approved laboratory.
               c.   Individuals undergoing pre-employment testing shall not
begin official employment with the FCFC until after all test results are
received and shown to be negative. Upon receipt of the test result, positive or
negative, the County Judge/Executive or his or her designee shall inform the
appropriate department head of the results.
            2.   Random testing.
               a.   Employees in a safety sensitive position will be required
to participate in a statistically valid, unannounced random selection process,
which will subject them to mandatory drug and/or alcohol testing. This category
of testing will conduct random tests for alcohol at a rate of no more than 10%
for non-federally regulated safety sensitive positions. Employees holding
positions in which a commercial driver’s license (CDL) is required, must also
be tested at a minimum rate of 10% for alcohol annually to satisfy Department
of Transportation (DOT) requirements.
               b.   In the case of random testing for drug use, non-federally
regulated safety sensitive positions will be tested at a rate of no more than
10%. Employees holding positions in which a CDL is required, must be tested for
drugs at a rate of 50% annually to satisfy DOT requirements. All employees in
federally regulated safety sensitive positions shall be selected from a pool
that is separate from the random selection pool for other non-federally
regulated safety sensitive positions.
               c.   The County Fiscal Court shall utilize a third party to
conduct the random selection of safety sensitive employees, including employees
holding a CDL, to be tested. This random testing shall be unannounced and will
take place throughout each calendar year. Safety sensitive employees are
selected by a third party administrator using a statistically valid, random
method of selection using specific employee codes. Because of the random nature
of this testing process, safety sensitive employees may be selected for testing
more than once or not at all. Once an employee is notified that he or she has
been selected for testing, the employee must proceed immediately to the testing
site of FCFC’s choosing.
               d.   Note: employees in non-safety sensitive positions will not
be included in the random selection pool. However, non-safety sensitive
employees will be subject to testing for other reasons. Procedures and
protocols for “reasonable suspicion”, “post accident”, “return-to-duty” and
“follow-up” testing, all of which testing types are described elsewhere in this
policy will apply in their case.
            3.   Reasonable suspicion testing.
               a.   A reasonable suspicion test shall be based on a belief that
an employee is using or has used drugs or alcohol in violation of this policy,
drawn from specific objective facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those
facts in light of experience, training or education. The reasonable suspicion
testing shall be based upon:
                  i.   While at work, direct observation of drug or alcohol use
or of the physical symptoms or manifestations of being under the influence of a
drug or alcohol;
                  ii.   While at work, abnormal conduct, erratic behavior or a
significant deterioration in work performance;
                  iii.   A report of drug or alcohol use provided by a reliable
and credible source;
                  iv.   Evidence that an individual has tampered with a drug or
alcohol test during employment with the FCFC;
                  v.   Information that an employee has caused, contributed to
or been involved in an accident while at work; and
                  vi.   Evidence that an employee has used, possessed, sold,
solicited or transferred illegal or illicit drugs or used alcohol while on
FCFC’s premises or while operating FCFC’s vehicle, machinery or equipment.
               b.   The County Judge/Executive or his or her designee shall be
notified immediately of any indication of reasonable suspicion. Both the
observing department supervisor and the County Judge/Executive, or his or her
representative, will review the policies and procedures herein and, if
necessary, make arrangements with a testing facility of FCFC’s choosing to
conduct reasonable suspicion drug and/or alcohol testing as soon as possible.
If a representative from the office of the County Judge/Executive is not
available, the observing supervisor shall obtain the assistance of another FCFC
supervisor or other credible and reliable source and, together, they shall
complete the reasonable suspicion form, and forward it to the County Judge/
Executive or his or her designee. If, after completing the form, it is
determined that there is, in fact, reasonable suspicion that the employee is
under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, the observing supervisor or his or
her designee will notify the employee and accompany him or her to the testing
site.
               c.   When a reasonable suspicion test is ordered, the employee
must submit to testing within 45 minutes of being notified that he or she will
be tested. The observing supervisor and/or designee shall remain at the testing
site with the employee being tested, until the collection process is completed.
Any employee who is tested for reasonable suspicion shall be placed on leave
with pay until the results of the test are known. After submitting to the drug/
alcohol test, the employee may not return to work until the results of the test
are known and only then if the results are negative. Only the County Judge/
Executive or his or her authorized designee may order a reasonable suspicion
test.
            4.   Post-accident testing. Drug and alcohol testing will be
conducted following an employee’s involvement in an accident in which property
damage occurs, on or off FCFC’s premises while on duty or in the course of
employment for FCFC, or which requires off-site medical attention be
administered to a person.
            5.   Qualifying event exception.
               a.   Due to varying types of accident causes, all accidents
categorized as a “qualifying event” may not require post-accident testing.
Exceptions to the “qualifying event” for requiring post-accident drug and
alcohol testing will include, but may not be limited to the following types of
accidents:
                  i.   Injuries whose onset is cumulative or gradual, such as
carpel tunnel syndrome, progressive hearing loss, mental disorders, dermatitis,
respiratory diseases, skin disorders and the like; and
                  ii.   Injuries where the employee can be completely
discounted as the major contributing factor or those injuries occurring during
physical fitness or a training event, in which the employee did everything
within reason to avoid the injury accident (i.e., was performing training as
instructed).
               b.   In each case, the County Judge/Executive or his or her
designee shall determine the necessity of drug and alcohol testing and shall
communicate such testing with the involved employee and the employee’s
respective department head. The County Judge/Executive or his or her designee
shall coordinate all required tests with the appropriate medical facilities.
               c.   An employee involved in an accident while on an out-of-town
assignment shall notify his or her department director or the director’s
designee as soon as possible, but no later than two hours after the accident
occurred. The department director shall notify the County Judge/Executive or
her or his designee to discuss possible drug/alcohol testing requirements.
            6.   Other qualifying event. The department director or his or her
designee shall request controlled substance/breath alcohol testing when an
employee caused or cannot be completely discounted from causing a vehicular or
any other type of accident in which death, serious bodily injury or major
property damage did result or could have resulted. If a post-accident-
controlled substance/breath alcohol test is required, a confirmed positive test
result will result in employee discipline, up to and including termination.
            7.   Return-to-duty testing.
               a.   The County Fiscal Court maintains a treatment-oriented
policy for drugs and/or alcohol. Once selected for a drug or alcohol test,
should the test be positive, without a valid medical or bio-medical reason as
confirmed by a medical review officer, he or she will immediately be referred
to treatment, intervention and possible termination of employment.
               b.   Only in circumstances in which the employee voluntarily
elects to seek assistance for a substance abuse problem through the employee
assistance program prior to being selected for a test, completes whatever form
of treatment a substance abuse professional recommends and is willing to sign a
return to work/treatment plan agreement, will FCFC consider allowing the
employee to return to work after treatment is successfully completed as
confirmed by a substance abuse professional.
               c.   In all cases, it shall be at the discretion of the FCFC
subject to all applicable laws and regulations, as to whether to allow an
employee to return to work. In the event that an employee who has voluntarily
sought assistance, prior to being selected for a controlled substance or breath
alcohol test is allowed to enter a controlled substance/alcohol abuse
rehabilitation program, the employee may be allowed to return to work only
under the following circumstances.
                  i.   The employee may resume regular duties only after the
employee tests negative in an alcohol and/or controlled substance test
administered by the FCFC-approved laboratory and can provide a release to
return to work from an appropriate substance abuse treatment facility or
confirmation of continued and on-going participation in a FCFC recognized
substance abuse assistance program. An employee must test negative within a
reasonable period of time from receipt of the initial test results not to
exceed 45 days. Any repeat occurrence of substance abuse or violation of any
other aspect of the FCFC’s drug-free workplace policy will result in immediate
termination.
                  ii.   Prior to returning to work, the employee shall be
required to meet with the County Judge/Executive or his or her authorized
designee to receive an explanation of the terms of continued employment; and to
sign a written return-to-work/treatment plan agreement, detailing the terms
under which the employee will be allowed to return to work. Such agreement
shall stipulate that the employee, at the county’s request, may be required at
any time, to submit to interviews and/or evaluation by the professional staff
at an appropriate chemical dependency treatment facility approved by the FCFC’s
employee assistance program (EAP). The return-to-work agreement will also
stipulate that the employee be required to submit to unannounced controlled
substance and/or alcohol testing for up to 12 months after resuming duties.
            8.   Follow-up testing. Any employee returning to work from
successful completion of the employee assistance program for drug- and/or
alcohol-related problems, or a drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation program,
shall be required to undergo one year of quarterly drug and alcohol testing.
The frequency of the follow-up testing shall consider recommendations of any
involved substance abuse professional (SAP), but shall be not less than once
per quarter (every three months) for at least one year. All follow-up testing
may be requested at any time and shall be unannounced.
            9.   Testing protocol.
               a.   The collection of samples and administration or drug and
alcohol tests shall follow all standards, procedures and protocols set forth by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Administration (SAMHSA). Test results will be obtained by a qualified
laboratory as defined elsewhere in this policy and results shall undergo a
medical review as follows.
                     i.   All test results shall be submitted for medical
review by a medical review officer (MRO) of the county’s choosing, who shall
consider the medical history of the employee or applicant, as well as relevant
biomedical information.
                  ii.   If there is a positive test result, the employee or
applicant will be given an opportunity to report to the MRO the use of any
prescription or over-the-counter medication.
                  iii.   If the MRO determines that there is a legitimate
medical explanation for a positive test result, the MRO may certify that the
test results do not indicate the unauthorized use of alcohol or a controlled
substance.
                  iv.   If the MRO determines, after appropriate review, that
there is not a medical explanation for the positive test result other than the
unauthorized use of alcohol or a prohibited drug, the MRO shall refer the
individual tested to the County Judge/Executive or his or her authorized
representative for further proceedings in accordance with FCFC’s drug-free
workplace policy.
               b.   Note: MRO determinations concerning the use of alcohol or a
controlled or illicit substance shall comply with all procedures outlined in
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (SAMHSA)’s Medical Review
Officer Manual for Federal Drug Testing Programs.
            10.   Testing process.
               a.   Employees shall report to the collection site of FCFC’s
choosing immediately after being provided the notification to test. In the case
of reasonable suspicion testing, a supervisor or designee shall escort the
employee to the collection site. Drug testing will be conducted by urine sample
while alcohol testing will be analyzed using a breath alcohol testing/screening
device. Drug and alcohol analysis will be performed by a trained technician.
               b.   To ensure that the test specimen is actually that of the
donor, collection site staff will require positive identification of the test
subject.
               c.   To ensure the accuracy and fairness of our testing program,
all testing will be conducted according to Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA) guidelines where applicable and will include a
screening test; a confirmation test; the opportunity for a split sample; review
by a medical review officer, including the opportunity for employees who test
positive to provide a legitimate medical explanation, such as a physician’s
prescription, for the positive result; and a documented chain of custody.
               d.   All drug-testing information will be maintained in separate
confidential records.
      (3)   Alcohol. The County Fiscal Court shall require all tests for
alcohol to be performed by a certified breath alcohol technician (BAT).
      (4)   Drugs.
         (a)   An 11-panel urine test will be conducted and shall include
analysis for the following substances:
            1.   Amphetamines;
            2.   Marijuana metabolite;
            3.   Cocaine;
            4.   Opiates;
            5.   Phencyclidine (PCP);
            6.   Benzodiazepines;
            7.   Propoxyphene;
            8.   URN creatinine;
            9.   Methadone; and
            10.   Barbiturates.
         (b)   Each employee, as a condition of employment, will be required to
participate in pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, return-to-
duty and follow-up testing upon selection or request of management. Safety
sensitive employees will be required to participate in all of the above,
including random testing.
         (c)   Any employee who tests positive will be immediately removed from
duty, referred to a substance abuse professional for assessment and
recommendations, required to pass a return-to-duty test and sign a return-to-
work agreement, subject to ongoing, unannounced, follow-up testing for a period
of five years and terminated immediately if he or she tests positive a second
time or violates the return-to-work agreement.
         (d)   An employee will be subject to the immediate termination of
employment if he or she refuses the screening or the test, adulterates or
dilutes the specimen, substitutes the specimen with that from another person or
sends an imposter, fails or declines to take a second drug test when directed,
will not sign the required forms or refuses to cooperate in the testing process
in such a way that prevents completion of the test.
      (5)   Prohibited behavior.
         (a)   It is a violation of the drug-free workplace policy to use,
possess, sell, trade and/or offer for sale alcohol, illegal drugs or
intoxicants.
         (b)   Prescription and over-the-counter drugs are not prohibited when
taken in standard dosage and/or according to a physician’s prescription. Any
employee taking prescribed or over-the- counter medications will be responsible
for consulting the prescribing physician and/or pharmacist to ascertain whether
the medication may interfere with safe performance of his or her job. If the
use of a medication could compromise the safety of the employee, fellow
employees or the public, it is the employee’s responsibility to use appropriate
personnel procedures (e.g., call in sick, use leave, request change of duty,
notify supervisor, notify company doctor) to avoid unsafe workplace practices.
         (c)   The illegal or unauthorized use of prescription drugs is
prohibited. It is a violation of the FCFC’s drug-free workplace policy to
intentionally misuse and/or abuse prescription medications. Appropriate
disciplinary action will be taken if job performance deterioration and/or other
accidents occur.
         (d)   The County Fiscal Court reserves the right to define and
interpret prohibited activities that specifically include, but may not be
limited to:
            1.   Alcohol.
               a.   Prohibited conduct involving the use of alcohol includes
the following:
                  i.   The performance of or being immediately available to
perform work duties while having an alcohol concentration greater than 0.02;
                  ii.   The consumption of alcohol or products containing
alcohol during the performance of or being immediately available to perform
work responsibilities;
                  iii.   In the case of safety sensitive employees, containing
alcohol during the performance of or being immediately able to perform safety
sensitive work responsibilities. This includes the possession of medicines
containing alcohol (prescription or over-the-counter) unless the seal is
unbroken and/or the medication is prescribed by a licensed physician, and said
physician has confirmed the necessity of the safety sensitive employees’ said
possession of the prescribed substance containing alcohol and has confirmed
that the use of such substance will not deter from the employee’s ability to
safely perform assigned safety sensitive responsibilities, in the latter case,
a prescription drug notification form must be on file with the County Judge/
Executive or his or her designee;
                  iv.   The performance of, or being immediately available to
perform those responsibilities designated as safety sensitive, within four
hours after using alcohol;
                  v.   The transportation and/or possession of alcoholic
beverages (open or closed containers) within FCFC-owned vehicles or equipment.
Note: law enforcement personnel functioning within the scope of their assigned
duties shall be considered exempt from this prohibition as deemed necessary by
their respective department head(s);
                  vi.   The use of alcohol for eight hours immediately
following an accident requiring a post-accident alcohol test or until a post-
accident test is administered, whichever occurs first; and
                  vii.   Refusal to submit or cooperate with any of the
required testing types.
               b.   The operation of a FCFC-owned vehicle following consumption
of alcoholic beverages shall be considered a violation of this policy and shall
result in discipline, up to and including termination.
               c.   Note: employees attending training programs and/or
conferences related to their employment with FCFC may participate in social
functions associated with the program or conference. If alcoholic beverages are
present at the social function and the employee chooses to engage in
consumption of said beverage(s), he or she shall do so at his or her own
discretion. Employees who choose to engage in the consumption of alcoholic
beverages as part of a work-related social function shall do so in a
responsible manner, maintaining a conduct that would not reflect adversely upon
the FCFC. Any unbecoming conduct by an employee who has chosen to consume
alcohol at such conference or training program that has an adverse effect upon
the FCFC will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination
of employment.
            2.   Notification of convictions. Employees are hereby notified
that they shall inform the County Judge/Executive or his or her authorized
designee, of any criminal charge or conviction within five days of said charge
or conviction. The County Judge/Executive shall take appropriate action within
30 days.
            3.   Drugs or controlled substances. Prohibited conduct involving
the use of drugs or controlled substances includes, but may not be limited to,
the following:
               a.   Possession of prescription and over-the-counter drugs when
the drugs exceed the standard dosage and/or not in accordance with the
physician’s prescription. However, any safety sensitive employee taking
prescribed or over-the-counter medications will, in all cases, be responsible
for consulting the prescribing physician and/or pharmacist to ascertain whether
the medication may interfere with the safe performance of his or her safety
sensitive job duties. Prior to initiating usage after such medications are
prescribed, the safety sensitive employee shall submit a prescription drug
notification form to his or her immediate supervisor who shall in turn, submit
it to the County Judge/ Executive or his or her designee as soon as possible.
                  i.   After receiving such form, the County Judge/Executive or
his or her authorized designee may request written medical authorization
showing the safety sensitive employee may possess/use such medication, that it
was used in the prescribed manner and showing the safety sensitive employee is
fit to safely perform safety sensitive assigned duties. If the use of such
medication could compromise the safety of the safety sensitive employee, fellow
employees or the public at large, it is the safety sensitive employee’s
responsibility to use appropriate personnel procedures (e.g., call in sick, use
leave, request change of duty and notify his or her supervisor) to avoid unsafe
workplace practices. No prescription drugs shall be brought onto FCFC property,
or consumed on county property by anyone other than the individual for whom the
drugs have been prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner. The illegal or
unauthorized use of prescription drugs is strictly prohibited. It is a
violation of the FCFC’s drug-free workplace policy to intentionally misuse and/
or abuse prescription medications.
                  ii.   Any intentional misuse and/or abuse of prescription
medication will result in termination.
                  iii.   FCFC reserves the right to have a designated physician
of its choosing to determine if a prescription drug or medication produces
effects that would be considered unacceptable in the performance of assigned
safety sensitive work duties. The designated physician has final determination
on whether the medication will have or is having an unacceptable effect on the
safety sensitive employee’s performance of duties. In such instances of
temporary impediment to safe performance of regular safety sensitive duties,
the safety sensitive employee may be temporarily reassigned to duties requiring
a lesser safety awareness level if such duties are available.
                  iv.   All doctor’s statements and related medical information
shall be confidential and maintained in a separate medical file in the Human
Resources office.
               b.   Testing positive for any of the prohibited substances
during the performance of or immediately prior to or during the performance of
work responsibilities.
               c.   Refusal (as defined elsewhere in this policy) to cooperate
with any of the requested testing types.
               d.   Tampering with or attempting to alter, or actual altering
of a test specimen is strictly prohibited and is grounds for immediate
termination from employment with the FCFC.
            4.   Volatile substances. The intentional misuse, manufacture,
sale, distribution, dispensation or possession of a volatile substance as
defined in KRS 217.900 which includes any glue, cement, paint or other
substance containing a solvent or chemical having the property of releasing
toxic vapors or fumes which when intentionally inhaled may cause a condition of
intoxication, inebriation, stupefaction, dulling of the brain or nervous system
or distortion or disturbance of auditory, visual or mental processes while at
work, while on FCFC property, or while conducting FCFC business while off FCFC
property, is strictly prohibited and is considered cause for immediate
discipline, up to and including termination.
   (F)   Consequences.
      (1)   One of the goals of the drug-free workplace program is to encourage
employees to voluntarily seek help with alcohol and/or drug problems. If,
however, an individual violates the policy, the consequences are serious.
      (2)   In the case of applicants, if he or she violates the drug-free
workplace policy, the offer of employment shall be withdrawn. The applicant may
reapply after six months and must successfully pass a pre-employment drug test.
      (3)   If an employee violates the policy, he or she will be subject to
progressive disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment
and may be required to enter rehabilitation. An employee required to enter
rehabilitation who fails to successfully complete it and/or repeatedly violates
the policy will be terminated from employment. Nothing in this policy prohibits
the employee from being disciplined or discharged for other violations and/or
performance problems.
   (G)   Assistance.
      (1)   Alcohol and drug abuse and addiction are recognized as diseases
responsive to proper treatment. The FCFC provides a level of care through its
employee assistance program (EAP). It also realizes that early intervention and
support improve the success of rehabilitation. To support the employees, FCFC’s
drug-free workplace policy:
         (a)   Encourages employees to seek help if they are concerned that
they or their family members may have a drug and/or alcohol problem; and
         (b)   Encourages employees to utilize the services of qualified
professionals in the community to assess the seriousness of suspected drug or
alcohol problems and identify appropriate sources of help.
      (2)   Treatment for alcoholism and/or other drug use disorders may be
covered by the employee benefit plan. However, the ultimate financial
responsibility for recommended treatment belongs to the employee.
      (3)   Employees who voluntarily report a substance abuse problem prior to
being required to take a controlled substance or alcohol test as defined in
this policy, will not be subject to disciplinary action if they voluntarily and
conscientiously seek substance abuse assistance and agree to a treatment plan.
However, such an employee must understand that if the problem is not corrected
and satisfactory job performance is not maintained, he or she will be subject
to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Failure
to seek such assistance, or failure to abide by the terms of the treatment
plan, shall be grounds for termination. Upon voluntarily reporting a substance
abuse problem, the employee will be required to sign a substance abuse
treatment plan return-to-work agreement form that will further define
conditions of continued employment.
   (H)   Confidentiality.
      (1)   All information received by FCFC through the drug-free workplace
program is confidential communication. Access to this information is limited to
those who have a legitimate need to know in compliance with relevant laws and
management policies.
      (2)   FCFC shall maintain records and documents of all alcohol and drug
test results, schedules for follow-up tests and records relating to evaluation
and referrals. These records shall be maintained for a period of at least five
years. FCFC shall provide test result information or other pertinent
information relating to an applicant or existing employee’s alcohol or
controlled substance tests upon the applicant or existing employee’s written
request, and shall do so within three working days of being notified of the
request.
   (I)   Policy administration and enforcement. It shall be the responsibility
of the County Judge/ Executive or his or her designee to administer and enforce
this policy. This policy and its programs are not to be interpreted or modified
by any other county supervisor or director.
   (J)   Responsibility.
      (1)   While it is ultimately FCFC’s legal, ethical and moral
responsibility to create and maintain a safe and productive drug-free workplace
for its employees, and the citizens of the county, such safety is achieved
through cooperation and shared responsibility. Both employees and management
have important roles to play.
      (2)   All employees are required to not report to work or be subject to
duty while their ability to perform job duties is impaired due to on or off
duty use of alcohol or other drugs.
      (3)   In addition, employees are encouraged to:
         (a)   Be concerned about working in a safe environment; and
         (b)   Report dangerous behavior to their supervisor.
      (4)   It is the supervisor’s responsibility to:
         (a)   Inform employees of the drug-free workplace policy;
         (b)   Observe employee performance;
         (c)   Investigate reports of dangerous practices;
         (d)   Document negative changes and problems in performance;
         (e)   Counsel employees as to expected performance improvement; and
         (f)   Clearly state consequences of policy violations.
   (K)   Communication.
      (1)   Communicating the drug-free workplace policy to both supervisors
and employees is critical to its success. To ensure all employees are aware of
their role in supporting FCFC’s drug-free workplace program:
         (a)   All employees will receive a written copy of the policy;
         (b)   The policy will be reviewed in orientation sessions with new
employees; and
         (c)   The policy and assistance programs will be reviewed at safety
meetings. Every supervisor will receive training to help him or her recognize
and manage employees with alcohol and other drug problems.
      (2)   Note: the County Fiscal Court may change, modify, amend or rescind
any part of this policy at any time that deals with the actual administration
of the policy itself. However, changes may not be made to the policy that would
circumvent any requirements associated with 803 KAR 25:280.

places of work within the county.
   (C)   An employee summoned as a plaintiff or a defendant in a proceeding
involving or arising from outside employment or personal business or affairs

§ 30.086 VOTING LEAVE.
   All full-time employees entitled to vote in any election shall be given up
to two hours off on Election Day to vote, with pay (primary and general) and a
full day (up to eight hours) for presidential elections if the employee is
working during polling hours of 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. If the employee works a
partial shift during polling hours, he or she will only be allowed voting leave
for the time worked during those hours. Employees not scheduled to work on
election days will not receive additional pay. The supervisor or the County
Judge/Executive may specify the hours during which each employee may be allowed

will be retained in the employee’s file with the payroll officer. Leave time
must be taken at the time of donation unless circumstances require the employee
to return to work. In this case, the unused portion of leave time will be
credited as compensatory time. No compensatory time will be granted if the
employee is not required to return to work.
   (B)   Employees not accepted as blood donors must promptly return to their
work stations, but will not be charged for the time spent attempting to donate.
(Ord. 4-2014, passed 7-31-2014, § 3.53)
§ 30.088 INCLEMENT WEATHER LEAVE.
   It is the policy of County Fiscal Court to provide services to the people of
the county year-round; however, there are situations that may arise due to the
needs of public safety where the Fiscal Court and/or judicial operations may
need to be reduced or closed, including, but not limited to, weather, floods,
natural disasters and the like. This policy shall cover those situations and
address employee leave when Fiscal Court is closed or operations are curtailed
because of hazards or other emergencies.
   (A)   In the event of adverse weather conditions where travel to and from
work may jeopardize the safety of employees, county offices may be closed at
the direction of the County Judge/Executive. Notification of closure shall be
posted on the social media page, the county’s webpage and publicized on
television. Essential employees shall report to work as required at their
regular rate of pay. Essential employees consist of Road Department, Fire
Department and Maintenance Department employees.
   (B)   The County Judge/Executive may defer his or her authority for closure
of the Courthouse building to the Chief Circuit Judge. If the County Judge/
Executive has deferred his or her authority to the Chief Circuit Judge and, if
the Chief Circuit Judge cancels Courthouse operations, he or she may also close
the Courthouse.
   (C)   If county offices remain open but an employee cannot travel to and
from work due to unsafe conditions, the employee shall use accrued leave time.
Employees must notify their supervisors that they will be unable to make it to
work within one hour of the time their shift begins. Essential employees shall
contact and coordinate with their supervisor or department head.
   (D)   If an employee cannot report to work and notifies their supervisor or
department head of their intent to use accrued leave, but the County Judge/
Executive closes the offices early, the employee must still use accrued time
for the entire work day. Employees that report to work prior to the County
Judge/Executive closing the offices will be paid for the entire work day as
other paid leave.
   (E)   In the event the County Judge/Executive notifies that the offices will
be closed the following day, non-essential employees will be paid for the
entire day in which the offices are closed; provided, however, that, those
employees who were scheduled to take off shall take their leave as previously
requested.
   (F)   Employees of the Road Department are considered essential employees.
Due to the Road Department’s unique work and responsibilities, Road Department
essential employees shall be paid a rate of one and one-half hours for all
emergency work during non-working hours. An emergency shall include, but not be
limited to, snow and ice, tornadoes, floods and natural disasters. If the
emergency work falls on a holiday, Road Department essential employees shall be
paid double their normal rate of pay.
   (G)   Other employees may be deemed essential by the County Judge/Executive
depending upon the circumstances.
   (H)   If the County Judge/Executive requires the Maintenance Department to
report to work during an emergency, they will be paid according to division (F)
above.

§ 30.089 HEALTH INSURANCE.
   (A)   The county pays for one single health insurance policy for each
employee unless the premium exceeds the amount set by Fiscal Court. In the
event an employee is out of work due to illness, regardless of cause, the

exceed 12 weeks.
   (B)   Benefits are as set forth in the carrier contract.
   (C)   Employees are covered under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Act of
1986 (COBRA). In summary, COBRA provides that each qualified beneficiary who
would lose coverage under the group health plan as a result of a qualifying
event is entitled, under the plan, to elect, within the election period,
continuation coverage under the plan at his or her expense for a limited time.
This summary statement is not intended to supplant the Act. All rights are set
forth in the Act and should be consulted for official decisions. The payroll
administrator can facilitate this process.

(Ord. 4-2014, passed 7-31-2014, § 3.59)
§ 30.094 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993.
   (A)   The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), being 29 U.S.C. §§

been exhausted, the remaining FMLA time will be leave without pay.
(Ord. 4-2014, passed 7-31-2014, § 3.60)

responsible to pay.
   (F)    Each employee shall sign certification that he or she has been given
an opportunity to review §§
30.035 through
30.103 of this chapter and received orientation on their job.
(Ord. 4-2014, passed 7-31-2014, § 3.61)
§ 30.096 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS.
   (A)   The County Judge/Executive and department heads are responsible for

§ 30.097 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Any employee who believes that he or she has been aggrieved by any act

within ten working days of the incident in accordance with the following
procedure.
      (1)   An aggrieved person shall submit a written statement on the county
grievance form to the department head setting forth the nature of the grievance
and facts upon which the allegation is based. The written statement must be

      (2)   The department head shall contact the complainant no later than ten
working days after receiving the written statement to establish meeting with
the objective of resolving the matter informally. However, in no case shall the
informal meeting be conducted sooner than five working days nor more than 30
calendar days after receiving the written statement. There shall be prepared

(Ord. 4-2014, passed 7-31-2014, § 3.63)
§ 30.098 CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   POSITION CLASSIFICATION refers to the organizing of positions into
groups of classes on the basis of their duties and qualification requirements.
Position classification will facilitate proper employee compensation,
selection, placement, promotion and training.
      (2)   The basic purpose of a personnel management system is to assist in
hiring and retaining well-qualified employees. This means the development of
fair and equitable recruitment, selection, promotion, pay and fringe benefit
programs. Employees’ salaries will be based on the value of the services they
render. All parts of an effective personnel management system work together
toward these goals.
   (B)   Administration of the plan.
      (1)   A classification plan is not intended to fix positions permanently
into classes. Instead, the plan must be reviewed continually to adapt to
changing conditions. It is recommended that plan administration include
responsibility for reviewing existing or new positions for purposes of
classification, reclassification and pay level determinations. However, all
changes are subject to the approval of the Fiscal Court.
      (2)   The county should normally conduct a comprehensive periodic review
of the classification plan. Between comprehensive reviews, county officials
responsible for personnel should conduct work audits of various positions to
assure that the plan is current and corresponds with existing conditions.
      (3)   Three specific types of changes in the plan itself are possible:
         (a)   Abolition of a class. A class shall be abolished when all
positions in a class are abolished or when positions are significantly changed
in the nature of work, duties and responsibilities so that the class becomes
inappropriate, inaccurate or irrelevant.
         (b)   Adjustment or revision of a class. A class specification shall
be adjusted or revised to meet changing circumstances and needs. Minor
rewriting of class specifications will suffice in most cases.
         (c)   Creation of a new class. A new class shall be created when new
work situations arise that are not covered by the established class
specifications. New classes must be justified, and reflect substantially
permanent rather than temporary situations. All proposed changes shall be
carefully scrutinized to maintain service morale, validity of class concepts
and integrity of class relationships established in the classification and pay
plans.
   (C)   Position classification plan.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         CLASS. A position or group of positions that have similar duties and
responsibilities, required qualifications and can be equitably compensated by
the same wage range.
         CLASS SERIES. Consists of two or more classes which are substantially
similar as to the types of work involved and differ only in rank as determined
by the importance of the duties, degree of responsibility, and amount of
training and experience required. Titles usually are differentiated by I, II
and the like.
         CLASS SPECIFICATION. The official written description of a class and
consists of a class title, a general statement of the duties and
responsibilities and level of work, essential functions to be performed,
required skills and abilities, acceptable experience and training and necessary
special requirements, if any.
         CLASSIFICATION PLAN. The official or approved system of grouping
positions into appropriate classes and includes an index to the class
specification, a list allocating each existing position to proposed or existing
classes and rules for the administration of the plan.
         EMPLOYEE. An individual legally employed to perform the duties and
carry out the responsibilities of a position. For classification purposes, it
is the duties and responsibilities of the position, not the employee, that must
be considered.
         POSITION. A group of currently assigned duties and responsibilities
requiring the full or part-time employment of one person.
         POSITION CLASSIFICATION.
            1.   A system of identifying and describing the different kinds of
work in an organization and grouping together under common job titles those
positions which are basically similar with respect to:
               a.   The nature of work;
               b.   The level of difficulty;
               c.   Degree of responsibility; and
               d.   Training and experience requirements.
            2.   POSITION CLASSIFICATION groups similar positions into the same
class so they may receive common treatment in employment practices.
      (2)   Uses of position classification.
         (a)   Position classification is the foundation upon which are
constructed all major phases of a personnel program. Each class specification
contains an analysis of the nature and degree of difficulty and responsibility
involved in the work of the class and provides a statement of the
qualifications that are required for successfully performing its duties and
responsibilities.
         (b)   For the administration, the position classification plan:
            1.   Forms the basis of an objective recruitment program;
            2.   May be used by each department head in perfecting or revising
organizational structure, clarifying lines of authority, fixing responsibility
and weighing personnel requirements;
            3.   Provides the background information for setting salary and
wage plans to assure equal pay for equal work;
            4.   Serves as the basis for establishment of work-related written,
oral, performance or other examinations; employee efficiency rating programs;
employee training and counseling; regulations governing original employment,
promotion, transfer, demotion, layoff and discharge; safety programs; and
research studies;
            5.   Provides uniform job terminology for payroll activities and
for the use of all persons concerned with personnel activities;
            6.   Facilitates the processes of budgeting and the most
advantageous placement and use of personnel; and
            7.   Keeps management informed of personnel assignments at all
times and helps locate duplication of functions, faulty organizations and
bottlenecks in the flow of work; assists in planning for increases or decreases
in work loads; and, generally, provides information necessary for practically
all problems involving the management of personnel.
         (c)   For the employee, a well-developed position classification plan:
            1.   Gives the employee a better concept of the activities of his
or her own department, of his or her own work assignment and of the county
services as a whole;
            2.   Shows them avenues of advancement, which may serve as an
incentive to improve their status through more intensive attention to duties
and by securing additional training or education;
            3.   Allows them to see the position and its duties and
responsibilities rather than the person occupying the position. An objective
look at his or her own position and other positions may answer many questions
that have affected an employee’s morale. The position classification plan shows
the employee that classification and pay are based on the level of difficulty
of assigned duties and responsibilities, not on how well the employee is
performing his or her duties when the supervisor evaluates for purposes of
salary increments or promotion; and
            4.   Assures the employee that his or her position has been
reviewed objectively in relation to other positions and that political and
other unrelated considerations have not been used as the basis of its
classification and pay.
(Ord. 4-2014, passed 7-31-2014, § 3.64)
§ 30.099 COMPENSATION PLAN.
   (A)   Purpose. The objective of the pay plan is to provide equal pay for
equal work and to provide a pay range for each class or position in the county
that will allow it to retain employees and to compete in the job market with
other private and public employers in the area.
   (B)   Relationship to the classification plan. In order to assure equal pay
for equal work, it is necessary to know what the duties and responsibilities of
each position are and what training, experience and skills are needed to carry
out these duties. This requires a large body of job knowledge, which can best
be obtained from a classification plan. The classification plan does not set
the pay rate. It merely provides that all those positions in the same class
shall have the same pay range. The pay plan provides for ranges of pay to which
positions are assigned. The integrity of the classification plan may be
maintained in the pay plan if the relative levels of worth among the classes
are maintained in allocating classes to the salary schedule.
   (C)   Factors in determining pay allocations. Many factors go into
determining the relative worth of a group of positions. These include:
      (1)   The required skills, knowledge and ability;
      (2)   The kind and level of work required;
      (3)   The nature and extent of supervision given and received;
      (4)   Responsibility for public contracts;
      (5)   Special working conditions;
      (6)   Training and experience requirements; and
      (7)   Execution of orders and policies.
   (D)   Application of pay plan.
      (1)   Ranges of pay are intended to be base pay for a standard workweek
in various classes of work as defined by county policy.
      (2)   Pay rates are not intended to include special assignment
differentials, reimbursement for travel expenses or other authorized expenses
incurred in connection with official business.
      (3)   The minimum rate of each class should be the normal entering rates.
Departures from this should be made only if necessary to fill a vacancy despite
vigorous recruitment efforts or as recognition of exceptional qualifications.
      (4)   Progression through the pay range will depend on funding
availability. However, under normal circumstances, the employee may receive a
pay increase when:
         (a)   An across-the-board or percentage increase is budgeted by the
County Fiscal Court;
         (b)   Merit increases are awarded due to outstanding performance; or
         (c)   A higher degree of certification in the class of employment is
attained.
      (5)   A promotion may require an adjustment in pay to reach the minimum
pay rate of the new classification. Further progression through the pay range
is governed by the same criteria as set forth in this division (D) above, as
well as elsewhere in these policies and procedures. If the employee has already
reached the minimum pay rate of the new classification plan, the Fiscal Court
shall determine an appropriate increase in compensation.
      (6)    The pay plan set forth on the following pages uses the federal
minimum wage as the base point for all classes. The compensation plan schedule
will increase on even years (2022, 2024, 2026, etc.) by the CPI authorized by
the Fiscal Court.
(Ord. 4-2014, passed 7-31-2014, § 3.65; Ord. 6-2022, passed 8-12-2022)
§ 30.100 CLASSIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES.
   There shall be two classifications of employees as follows:
   (A)   Exempt/administrative personnel.
      (1)   Please refer to the U.S. Department of Labor, Fair Labor Standards

§ 30.172 DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING, ZONING AND BUILDING CODE ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Purpose. In order to ensure that all persons are treated equally and
fairly, the following policies have been adopted to outline how, when and in
what manner electrical and building construction projects will be conducted.
   (B)   Electrical inspections.
      (1)   All electrical installations require an electrical permit to be
issued.
      (2)   Only electrical contractors currently licensed by the county, with
current workers’ compensation and liability insurance (see homeowner exception)
may file for an electrical permit.
      (3)   If a building permit is required for the construction, no
electrical inspection can be scheduled or completed until such time as the
building permit is issued.
      (4)   Inspections will be scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.
      (5)   With the exception of commercial and industrial projects, which are
billed to electrical contractors after completion of the project, no inspection
will be performed until the required inspection fee has been paid. See fee
schedules for applicable fees.
      (6)   If an electrical inspection is disapproved, the electrician or
property owners, performing their own work, will be required to pay the
applicable reinspection fee. See fee schedules for applicable fee.
      (7)   No project will be scheduled for a reinspection, if it was
previously denied, until the reinspection fee has been paid.
      (8)   On single-family and duplex construction, no temporary for service
only inspections will be performed. At the time the final inspection is
completed and approved, the certificate of compliance will be sent to the
applicable utility company for hook-up.
      (9)   If work, which is required to be inspected, is covered prior to the
inspection, the Planning and Building Codes office will fail the inspection and
will require that all work be removed so that the inspection can be made. In
this event, a reinspection fee will be required to be paid prior to the
Planning and Building Codes Office scheduling the reinspection.
      (10)   All electrical inspections will be performed using the National
Electrical Code, edition adopted by the Department of Housing, Buildings and
Construction.
      (11)   Homeowners performing their own electrical work on the residence,
in which they live, may perform their own electrical work and may apply for an
electrical permit from the Office of Planning, Zoning and Building Code
Enforcement. The homeowner is also required to file an affidavit certifying
that they are performing their own work.
   (C)   Building inspections.
      (1)   No building inspection will be scheduled until such time as the
building permit has been issued and obtained by the contractor or property
owner.
      (2)   All inspections will be scheduled on a first-come, first-served
basis.
      (3)   At the time the footer inspection is made, all property pins shall
be in place and string lines run so that it can be determined that the building
setback lines are in conformance with the subdivision plat or zoning ordinance.
      (4)   Letters from engineers certifying the construction of the footer
and the zoning setback lines will not be accepted, unless an inspection has
been scheduled, and our office fails to notify the property owner or contractor
that the inspection cannot be made. Letters from engineers will be accepted
only if the Planning and Building Codes Office requests it when there is a
disagreement on whether the structure meets the required setbacks and the
Planning and Building Codes Office agrees to accept an engineer’s or surveyor’s
survey showing compliance with the required zoning setback lines.
      (5)   Contractors or property owners, or their agents, are required to
meet the inspector on the site at the time of the inspection.
      (6)   A set of the construction plans, approved by the Department of
Planning, Zoning and Building Code Enforcement, will be required to be on the
site at the time of inspection.
      (7)   Framing and final inspections will be scheduled only after both
electrical and plumbing inspections have been approved.
      (8)   If an inspection is disapproved, the contractor or property owner
will be required to pay the applicable reinspection fee. (See fee schedules.)
      (9)   No reinspection will be scheduled until such time as the
reinspection fee has been paid.
      (10)   No structure shall be occupied, wholly or in part, unless and
until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Department of Planning,
Zoning and Building Code Enforcement.
      (11)   If work, which is required to be inspected, is covered prior to
the inspection, the inspector for the Planning and Building Codes office will
fail the inspection and will require that all work be removed so that the
inspection can be made. In this event, a reinspection fee will be required to
be paid prior to the Planning and Building Codes Office scheduling the re-
inspection.
      (12)   At the time the application for building permit is made, the
applicant will be required to choose which code (Kentucky Building Code or CABO
One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code) by which the construction project will be
reviewed and inspected.
(Ord. 4-2014, passed 7-31-2014, § 7.3)
§ 30.173 ACCEPTABLE USES OF THE INTERNET AND COUNTY E-MAIL.
   (A)   General. Each county employee and official shall be issued an official
county e-mail address, which shall be used and maintained for all official
business and correspondence of county government.
   (B)   Acceptable uses of the internet and county e-mail. The county-provided
internet and e-mail access is intended for business purposes only. The county
encourages the use of the internet and e-mail because it makes communication
more efficient and effective. However, internet service and e-mail are county
property, and their purpose is to facilitate county business. Every user has a
responsibility to maintain and enhance the county’s public image and to use
county e-mail and access to the internet in a productive manner. To ensure that
all users are responsible, the following guidelines have been established for
using e-mail and the internet. Any improper use of the internet or e-mail is
not acceptable and will result in appropriate disciplinary action, up to and
including dismissal.
   (C)   Unacceptable uses of the internet and county e-mail. The county
internet and e-mail access may not be used for transmitting, retrieving or
storage of any communications of a discriminatory or harassing nature or
materials that are obscene or X-rated. Harassment of any kind is prohibited. No
messages with derogatory or inflammatory remarks about race, age, disability,
religion, national origin, physical attributes or sexual preference shall be
transmitted. No abusive, profane or offensive language is allowed to be
transmitted through the county’s e-mail or internet system. Electronic media
may not be used for any purpose which is illegal, deceptive or against county
policy or contrary to the county’s best interest. Use of county e-mail or
internet for personal gain is prohibited.
   (D)   Communications.
      (1)   Each user is personally responsible for the content of all test,
audio or images that he or she places or sends over the county’s e-mail/
internet system. No e-mail or other electronic communications may be sent which
hides the identity of the sender or represents the sender as someone else or
someone from another entity. All messages communicated on the county’s e-mail/
internet system should contain the user’s name. Excessive personal
communications are prohibited. Any messages or information sent by a user to
another individual outside the county via an electronic network (e.g., bulletin
board, online service or internet) are statements that reflect on the county.
While some users include personal “disclaimers” in electronic messages, there
is still a connection to the county and the statements may be tied to the
county.
      (2)   All communications sent by users via the county’s e-mail/internet
system must comply with this and other county policies and may not disclose any
confidential or proprietary information.
   (E)   Downloading and installing software. To prevent computer viruses from
being transmitted through the county’s e-mail/internet system, there will be no
unauthorized downloading of any unauthorized software. All software downloaded
must be registered to the county. Users should contact the County Judge/
Executive if they have any questions.
   (F)   Copyright issues. Copyrighted material belonging to entities other
than the county may not be transmitted by users on the county’s e-mail/internet
system. All users obtaining access to other companies’ or individuals’
materials must respect all copyrights and shall not copy, retrieve, modify or
forward copyrighted materials, except with permission, or as a single copy, to
reference only. Failure to observe copyright or license agreements may result
in disciplinary action up to and including termination.
   (G)   Security. The county routinely monitors usage patterns for its e-mail/
internet communications. The reasons for this monitoring are many, including
cost analysis/allocation and the management of the county’s gateway to the
internet. All messages created, sent or retrieved over the county’s e-mail/
internet are the property of the county and may be considered public
information. The county reserves the right to access and monitor all messages
and files on the county’s e-mail/internet system. Users should not assume
electronic communications are totally private and should transmit highly
confidential data in other ways. Passwords and sign-on access codes shall not
be shared with anyone including co-workers, family members or other
unauthorized personnel. A user will be designated as system administrator for
e-mail/Internet purposes. Users shall minimize the risk of disclosing personal
information via electronic or other means. For more details, see §
30.174 of this chapter.
   (H)   Violations. Any employee who abuses the privilege of county-
facilitated access to e-mail or the internet will be subject to corrective
action up to and including termination. If necessary, the county reserves the
right to advise appropriate officials of any suspected illegal violations.
(Ord. 4-2014, passed 7-31-2014, § 7.4)
§ 30.174 PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   Definition. PERSONAL INFORMATION means an individual’s first name or
first initial and last name; personal mark; or unique biometric or genetic
print or image, in combination with one or more of the following data elements:
      (1)   An account number, credit card number or debit card number that, in
combination with any required security code, access code or password, would
permit access to an account;
      (2)   A Social Security number;
      (3)   A taxpayer identification number that incorporates a Social
Security number;
      (4)   A driver’s license number, state identification card number or
other individual identification number issued by any agency;
      (5)   A passport number or other identification number issued by the
United States government; or
      (6)   Individually identifiable health information as defined in 45
C.F.R. § 160.103, except for education records covered by the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, 34 C.F.R.
Part 99.
   (B)   Policy overview.
      (1)   The purpose of this policy is to minimize the risk of disclosing
personal information and setting practical guidelines for effectively
responding to security incidents. This policy sets forth the procedures and
practices pursuant to KRS 61.932. In addition, this policy requires appropriate
measures to protect information stored on media, both digital and non-digital,
during the entire term of its use, until its destruction.
      (2)   Non-digital media containing personal information shall be
physically controlled and securely stored in a manner meant to ensure that the
media cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals. This may require storing
media in locked containers such as cabinets, drawers, rooms or similar
locations if unauthorized individuals have unescorted access to areas where
personal information is stored. If personal information is stored in an
electronic format, it shall be protected from access by unauthorized
individuals. Such information must be protected by software that prevents
unauthorized access. If personal information is transmitted via e-mail or other
electronic means, it must be sent using appropriate encryption mechanisms.
      (3)   All personal information shall remain secure and, when applicable,
non-digital media shall be appropriately disposed. Non-digital media containing
personal information must be properly stored and secured from view by
unauthorized persons.
   (C)   Point of contact. The Judge/Executive shall designate a point of
contact (“POC”). The POC shall serve the following functions:
      (1)   Maintain the adopted information security policy and be familiar
with its requirements;
      (2)   Ensure that employees and others with access to personal
information are aware of and understand the information security policy;
      (3)   Serve as contact for inquiries from other agencies regarding its
information security policy and any incidents;
      (4)   Be responsible for ensuring compliance with the information
security policy; and
      (5)   Be responsible for responding to any incidents.
   (D)   Security software.
      (1)   Security software used to protect personal information must provide
user identification, authentication, data access controls, integrity and audit
controls.
      (2)   Security software should be adequately tested to confirm
functionality and to ensure that it is minimally disruptive to all associated
operating systems, communications, applications and other associated software
systems. Contractual provisions must also ensure that the supplier’s software,
by design or configuration, will not introduce any security exposures.
      (3)   The level of protection afforded by security software should be
commensurate with the sensitivity of the data. For example, if data resides in
a database that is deemed highly confidential, stringent access controls to the
database should be employed. The level of protection along with the methods to
implement that protection should be addressed before any personal information
is stored on a device.
      (4)   Systems, networks and application software used to process personal
information must adhere to the highest level of protection reasonably
practical. Intrusion detection and prevention software shall be used.
   (E)   Encryption. Information stored on digital media shall be encrypted in
accordance with contemporary standards.
   (F)   Access control. Only authorized individuals are permitted access to
media containing personal information. In addition to controlling physical
access, user authentication should provide audit access information. Any access
must comply with applicable regulatory requirements.
   (G)   Portable computing devices.
      (1)   This policy prohibits the unnecessary placement (download or input)
of personal information on portable computing devices. However, users who in
the course of business must place personal information on portable computing
devices must be aware of the risks involved and impact to the affected person/
entities in the event of actual or suspected loss or disclosure of personal
information. If personal information is placed on a portable computing device,
reasonable efforts must be taken, including physical controls and encryption,
to protect the information from unauthorized access.
      (2)   Additionally, each person using the portable computing device must
sign the county e-mail and internet user agreement form indicating acceptance
of the information and acknowledging his or her understanding of the
responsibility to protect the information. In the event the portable computing
device is lost or stolen, the user should be able to accurately recreate the
personal information and must be able to provide notification to all affected
persons/entities.
      (3)   When it is determined that personal information must be placed on a
portable computing device, every effort should be taken to minimize the amount
of information required. If possible, information should be abbreviated to
limit exposure (e.g., last four digits of the Social Security number).
   (H)   Physical security procedures.
      (1)   This policy section is to ensure that its information resources are
protected by physical security measures that address physical tampering,
damage, theft or unauthorized physical access. Access to restricted areas
containing information technology resources or other sources of personal
information shall be limited to authorized personnel only.
      (2)   When feasible, information technology equipment should be marked
with some form of identification that clearly indicates it is the property of
the county. During transport, media shall be protected and controlled outside
of secured areas and activities associated with transport of such media
restricted to authorized personnel. Tracking methods shall be developed and
deployed to ensure media reaches its intended destination.
   (I)   Types of incidents. Threats to the security of personal information
arise in many different ways. Attacks on personal information may arise from:
      (1)   External/removable media: an attack executed from removable media
(e.g., flash drive, CD) or a peripheral device;
      (2)   Attrition: an attack that employs brute force methods to
compromise, degrade or destroy systems, networks or services;
      (3)   Web: an attack executed from a website or web-based application;
      (4)   E-mail: an attack executed via an e-mail message or attachment;
      (5)   Improper usage: any incident resulting from violation of an
organization’s acceptable usage policies by an authorized user, excluding the
above categories;
      (6)   Loss or theft of equipment: the loss or theft of a computing device
or media used by the organization, such as a laptop or smart phone; and
      (7)   Other: an attack that does not fit into any of the other
categories.
   (J)   Destruction of records containing personal information.
      (1)   A media retention schedule shall be defined for all media in
accordance with regulatory requirements. The Fiscal Court shall have a
document/information retention policy. When records containing personal or
confidential information are ready for destruction, they shall destroy the
information completely to ensure that the information cannot be recognized or
reconstructed. In addition, any personal or confidential data contained on the
computer media must be obliterated and/or made indecipherable before disposing
of the tape, diskette, CD-ROM, zip disk or other type of medium.
      (2)   Appropriate methods and equipment must be used to routinely destroy
personal or confidential information. One of the following safeguards must be
implemented:
         (a)   Hire a document disposal contractor to dispose of the material.
The contractor should be certified by a recognized trade association and should
use disk sanitizing software and/or equipment approved by the United States
Department of Defense. The company’s information security policies and
procedures shall be reviewed and evaluated. Additionally, documents shall be
reviewed such as an independent audit of a disposal company’s operations and/or
its compliance with nationally recognized standards;
         (b)   Secure and utilize shredding equipment that performs cross-cut
or confetti patterns;
         (c)   Secure and utilize disk sanitizing or erasing software or
equipment approved by the United States Department of Defense;
         (d)   Incinerator or physical destruction; and
         (e)   Modify the information to make it unreadable, unusable or
indecipherable through any means.
   (K)   Reporting of incidents involving personal information.
      (1)   A security breach in which personal information is disclosed to, or
obtained by, an unauthorized person must be reported. Notification of the
incident must be made in the most prompt and expedient manner after the
incident has been discovered. Within 35 days, a letter notifying affected
individuals of actual or suspected loss or disclosure of personal information
must be sent describing the types of information lost and recommended actions
to be taken to mitigate the potential misuse of their information.
      (2)   When it has been identified that a security breach has occurred in
which personal information has been disclosed to, or obtained by, an
unauthorized person, within three business days the point of contact shall
notify the County Attorney or Commonwealth’s Attorney, State Police, the
Auditor of Public Accounts, the Attorney General and the Commissioner of the
Department for Local Government and complete form COT-FOT2. The following shall
be documented:
         (a)   Preliminary reporting and description of the incident;
         (b)   Response, including evidence gathered;
         (c)   Final assessment and corrective action taken; and
         (d)   Final reporting.
      (3)   Incident response procedures can be a reaction to security
activities such as:   
         (a)   Unauthorized access to personnel, data or resources;
         (b)   Denial of service attacks;
         (c)   Actual or anticipated widespread malware infections;
         (d)   Data breaches;
         (e)   Loss/theft of equipment;
         (f)   Significant disruption of services; and
         (g)   Significant level of unauthorized scanning activity to or from
hosts on the network.
   (L)   Investigation. Reasonable efforts shall be made to investigate any
security breaches in which personal information is disclosed to, or obtained
by, an unauthorized person and appropriate corrective action shall be taken.
   (M)   Disclosure communications. All federal and state laws and policies for
information disclosure to media or the public must be followed. In some
circumstances, communication about an incident is necessary, such as contacting
law enforcement. Employees should use discretion in disclosing information
about an incident. Such information includes network information, type of
incident, specific infection type (if applicable), number of assets affected,
specific detail about applications affected, applications used to employ
corrective action/investigate and the like. Within the parameters of the law,

powers provided for in this section. The fund shall consist of such sums of
money as may be hereafter appropriated by the City of Frankfort, the county or

where located, and shall be shared by the city and county on a 50-50 basis.
Such tax sharing, however, shall apply only to new businesses and new
industries. Expansions by existing businesses/industries shall not apply.
Likewise, governmental expansions or shifts of state governmental office
locations between the city and county shall not come under the tax sharing
requirement. However, in the event that governmental office locations change
due to annexation by the city or are in a location de-annexed by the city in
favor of the county, the city and county shall share the occupational taxes
generated from the effected state governmental office on a 50-50 basis.

shall be defined as those which, after 9-30-2006:

county.

property and other assets held by the Authority shall be divided between the
city and the county in the same proportions as the cumulative aggregate
contributions of each to the Authority, including interest, paid on any
indebtedness of the Authority; provided, however, that, no dissolution shall be

   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the County Judge/Executive shall have
access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and
other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy
such materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons
as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation; provided,
however, that, the County Judge/Executive first complies with the provisions of
the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The County
Judge/Executive may issue subpoenas to compel his or her access to or the
production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, any may issue
interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same
limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or
served in aid of a civil action in the United States District Court for the
district in which the investigation is taking place. The County Judge/Executive
may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the County Judge/Executive, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the same of the County Judge/Executive to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued by the County Judge/Executive himself or

face the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were
issued at his or her request.

subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the County Judge/Executive to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The County Judge/Executive shall grant the petition if he or she
finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable
time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to
any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly
onerous or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the County Judge/
Executive or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its
enforcement in the state court for the district in which the person to whom the
subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts business.

Judge/Executive participates as a part or as amicus, pursuant to this chapter.

§ 110.04 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, net profit shall
be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (c), and the denominator
of which is two;
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
subsection (3) of this section; and
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (A) through (D)of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the Occupational
Tax Office.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the county during the tax period by the business
entity for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation
paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the county based on the time the
individual’s service is performed within the county.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the county during the tax period, and
the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period:
      (1)   The sales, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
county if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
county regardless of the Free on Board point (FOB point) or other conditions of
the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the county and the purchaser is the
United States government;
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenue from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the county based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the county and
the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-
producing activity; and
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the county the
business entity may petition the county or the county may require, in respect
to all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)    Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the county; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the county, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the county.
The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage, which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the county bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the county to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.

form furnished or approved by the county a reconciliation of the occupational
license tax withheld where compensation is paid or payable to employees. Either
copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax statements, or
a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the county, shall be submitted.
   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or before
January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee
for payment to the county during the preceding calendar year.
   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this chapter shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid to one or
more employees of any business entity, and neither the corporate dissolution or
withdrawal of the business entity from the county, nor the cessation of holding
any corporate office, shall discharge that liability of any person; provided
that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each or every person
holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became obligated.
No person shall be personally and individually liable under this division (H)
who had no authority to collect, truthfully account for, or pay over any tax
imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes imposed by this chapter
become or became due.
   (I)   Every employee receiving compensation in the county subject to the tax
imposed under §
110.03 of this chapter shall be personally liable for the tax notwithstanding
the provisions of divisions (G) and (H). In all cases where the employer does
not withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee, such employee
or employees shall be responsible for filing with the county each quarter in
the same manner as if they were the employer. If an employer fails to or is not
required to withhold, report, or pay the license fee it shall become the duty
of the employee to file with the county. The only employer that is not required
to withhold, report, and pay the occupational license tax is the federal
government including the United States Postal Service. The payment required to
be made by an employee, can be made quarterly, for the periods ending March 31,
June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, or at any time the
employee wishes to make an estimated payment for the year in which wages are
earned. All license fees must be received by February 28 for the preceding
calendar year, together with a copy of the employee’s W-2 form. Employers not
required to withhold, report, or pay the license fee must annually during the
month of January of each year, make a return to the Occupational Tax
Administrator, in which is set forth the name and social security number of
each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar year, giving the
amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation earned during such
preceding year by each such employee. This list shall include all current full-
time employees, part-time employees, temporary employees, and terminated
employees whether it be voluntary or involuntary.

   (A)   All business entity returns for the preceding taxable year shall be
made by April 15 of each year, except returns made on the basis of a fiscal
year, which shall be made by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
the close of the fiscal year. Blank forms for returns shall be supplied by the
county.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its

the county, it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return of any
business entity in order to audit the return, the county may compel the
business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and
schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed. The county
may also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the federal
government.
   (C)    Every business entity subject to a occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns, and comply with rules as the county from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the county deems it necessary, the county may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath, or keep records, as the county deems sufficient
to determine the tax liability the business entity.
   (D)   The county may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the
taxable income of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of
the business entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity, as
appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the county at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return, determined without
regard to any extension of time for filing the return.
   (F)   It shall be the responsibility of persons who make Federal Form 1099
“non-employee compensation” payments to natural persons other than employees
for services performed within the county, to maintain records of such payments
and to report such payments to the county. Said payments must be reported on by
remitting Federal Form 1099 by February 28 of the year following the close of
the calendar year in which the non-employee compensation was paid. If a
business entity or person is not required to remit Federal Form 1099 to the
IRS, including but not limited to payments less than $600, they are still
liable to remit the equivalent information to the county. The information
required to be reported by said licensee shall include:
      (1)   Payer’s name, address, social security and/or federal
identification number.
      (2)   Recipient’s name and address;

§ 130.01 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   (A)   The County Fiscal Court finds that:
      (1)   Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke or use of vapor
products are a major contributor to indoor air pollution. Breathing secondhand
smoke is a cause of disease in healthy non- smokers. These diseases include
heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer. The National Cancer
Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early
deaths of up to 65,000 Americans annually (National Cancer Institute (NCI),
Health Effects of Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke: the Report of the
California Environmental Protection Agency, Smoking and Tobacco Control
Monograph 10, Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer
Institute (NCI), August 1999);
      (2)   The Public Health Service’s national toxicology program (NTP) has
listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen (Environmental Health Information
Service (BHTS), Environmental Tobacco Smoke: First Listed in the Ninth Report
on Carcinogens, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public
Health Service, NTP, 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on
carcinogens, 2003, 2005);
      (3)   A study of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in
Helena, Montana, before, during and after a local law eliminating smoking in
workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce
smoke-free workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in
morbidity from heart disease (Sargent, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M,; Glantz,
Stanton A., A Reduced Incidence of Admissions for Myocardial Infarction
Associated with Public Smoking Ban: Before and After Study, British Medical
Journal 328: 977-980, April 24, 2004);
      (4)   Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to the elderly,
individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway
disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma,
respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental
abnormalities and cancer (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA),
Health Effects of Exposure to Environmental, Tobacco Smoke, Tobacco Control 6
(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997);
      (5)   The Americans with Disabilities Act, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et
seq., which mandates access to public places and workplaces for persons with
disabilities, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability (Daynard,
R.A., Environmental Tobacco Smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act, Non-
smokers’ Voice 15(1); 8-9);
      (6)   The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation
of smokers and non- smokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not
eliminate, the exposure of non-smokers to secondhand smoke (Department of
Health and Human Services, The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking: A
Report of the Surgeon General, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease
Control, 1986);
      (7)   The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand
smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of
ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate
matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand
smoke (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Indoor Air Facts No. 5:
Environmental Tobacco Smoke, Washington, D.C.: Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), June 1989);
      (8)   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that
the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated
with exposure to tobacco smoke is non-linear at low doses, increasing rapidly
with relatively small doses such as those received from secondhand smoke or
actively smoking one or two cigarettes a day and has warned that all patients
at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary artery
disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking (Pechacek,
Terry F.; Babb, Stephen; A Commentary: How Acute and Reversible Are the
Cardiovascular Risks of Secondhand Smoke, British Medical Journal, 328: 980-
983, April 24, 2004);
      (9)   A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the
workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25-50% higher
risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and
cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease
in lung function (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.J.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas,
J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P.; Association Between Exposure
to Environmental Tobacco Smoke and the Development of Acute Coronary Syndromes:
The Cardio 2000 Case-Control Study, Tobacco Control 11(3); 220-225, September
2002);
      (10)   Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to
respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs,
increased health insurance rates and increased liability claims for diseases
related to exposure to secondhand smoke (The High Price of Cigarette Smoking,
Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997);
      (11)   Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts
and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a
positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be
smoke-free. Creation of smoke-free workplaces is sound economic policy and
provides the maximum level of employee health and safety (Giantz, S.A.; Smith,
L.; The Effect of Ordinances Requiring Smoke-Free Restaurants on Restaurant
Sales in the United States. American Journal of Public Healthy 87: 1687-1693,
1997; Colman, R.; Ufbonas, C.M., the Economic Impact of Smoke-Free Workplaces:
An Assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco Control Unit, Nova Scotia
Department of Health, GPI Atlantic, September 2001);
      (12)   Smoking is a potential cause of fires (Cigarette and Cigar Bums
and Ash Stains on Merchandise and Fixtures Cause Economic Damage to Business
Health, 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1957);
      (13)   The smoking of tobacco or vapor products is a form of air
pollution, a danger to health and a material public nuisance; and
      (14)   A survey of the indoor air quality of 11 locations in Frankfort,
Kentucky, including ten restaurants and one miscellaneous entertainment venue,
reflected that individuals at those locations are exposed to tobacco smoke
constituents at approximately 2.7 times the National Ambient Outdoor Standard
and the level of indoor air pollution at these locations as measured by the
average PM 2.5 level was approximately 9.6 times higher than the Lexington,
Kentucky, post smoking regulation law average PM 2.5 level.
   (B)   Accordingly, the County Fiscal Court adopts the foregoing findings as
justification for this chapter, the purpose of which is:
      (1)   To protect the public health and welfare by regulating smoking or
use of vapor products in buildings open to the general public; and
      (2)   To recognize the public’s need to breathe clean or smoke-free air.

§ 131.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate the direct commercial
distribution of certain explicit sexual materials to minors in order to aid
parents and guardians in supervising and controlling the access of minors to
such materials. The Court finds that whatever social value such material may
have for minors can adequately be served by its availability to young persons
through their parents or guardians. It is also the purpose of this chapter to
prohibit open public display of certain explicit sexual materials, in order to
protect persons from potential offense through involuntary exposure to such
materials.
(Ord. passed 7-1-1978)

NEW ROADWAYS
§ 151.01 RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   A minimum right-of-way of 40 feet shall be conveyed by the adjoining
property owners to the county. Said right-of-way shall be cleared, graded and
sloped to provide an adequate width for the roadway, adequate drainage and
sight distance, all to be approved by the County Road Superintendent. Any newly
proposed road, for a subdivision, shall otherwise satisfy all of the
requirements of Art. 4, § 4.3, of the Frankfort/Franklin County Subdivision
Regulations.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.02 ROADBED CONDITION.
   The roadway shall be prepared and shall provide a ten-inch stone base dense
grade aggregate, for a minimum width of 18 feet. Said roadways shall further be
prepared and shall provide for a minimum of three-inch bituminous asphalt base
and a one and one-half-inch bituminous asphalt surface. Any newly proposed
road, for a subdivision, shall otherwise be built to meet or exceed the minimum
design criteria as prescribed in Art. 6, § 6.4, of the Frankfort/Franklin
County Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.03 DENSITY OF POPULATION.
   Prior to acceptance for county maintenance, said roadway shall contain
adjoining thereto, at least ten permanent single-family residences suitable for
human occupancy per mile of said roadway. The county will accept for all
maintenance purposes any newly proposed road, for a subdivision, which is built
per the specifications as prescribed in the Frankfort/Franklin County
Subdivision Regulations; provided, however, the developer/owner and assigns
(hereinafter collectively referred to as the “developer”) may choose not to
install the final cap on a road until the subdivision, section or phase (as
hereinafter defied) is 50% occupied, in which event the county will accept for
snow and ice removal, but not for maintenance of drainage facilities, any road
within that subdivision, section or phase when proper installation of
Designated Geographic Area (DGA) and asphalt base is complete. Should the
developer choose the foregoing procedure, the developer will be required to
maintain, in effect, a letter of credit, surety bond or satisfactory
performance (referred to as the “bond”) in an amount sufficient to cover the
cost of the final cap at all times until the subdivision, section or phase is
50% occupied, at which time the developer shall be required to place the cap on
the road or if the developer should not do so, the county shall cash the bond
and place the final cap. Thirty days before expiration of the bond, the county
shall cash said bond and apply the proceeds therefrom to the completion of the
road(s) unless the developer furnishes evidence of renewal of the bond. The
bond required above shall be a part of and not in addition to the requirements
of the Planning Commission and shall be effective for a period of one year,
renewal annually; provided that, the amount thereof shall be pro rata reduced
upon the satisfactory installation of the DGA and asphalt base.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.04 PHASE DEVELOPMENT.
   To qualify for phase development of a subdivision, the developer must submit
to the County Planning Director a preliminary subdivision plat of the complete
subdivision and indicate on said plat the boundaries of the phase is or
sections in which the subdivision will be developed and the proposed sequence
of development. A presently-existing platted subdivision may qualify for phase
development if the developer submits a copy of the approved final plat to the
County Planning Director with the proposed phases or sections indicated as
described above, so long as each proposed phase or section constitutes at least
25% of the total subdivision as finally platted. Each phase or section must
abut an existing county, state or city maintained road. Presently existing
subdivisions, which have houses located on any non-county maintained road, must
include those roads in their initial proposed phase or section. Any subdivision
proposed after 8-1-1992 must indicate, on the preliminary subdivision plat
submitted to the Planning Commission, boundaries of the proposed phases or
section and the sequence of their proposed development.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.05 RELEASE OF LIABILITY.
   In order for a road, not accepted by the county for all maintenance
purposes, to qualify for county snow and ice removal, the developer must
release the county in writing from liability for ordinary damage to the road
done by county work crews prior to the final cap being placed on the road.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.06 BUILDING PERMITS.
   No building permit shall be issued to anyone for construction within a
subdivision on a road not theretofore accepted by the county for all
maintenance purposes unless there is an effective bond as prescribed above;
except, anyone other than the developer purchasing a lot prior to 8-1-1992 may
be issued a permit.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.07 STREET LIGHTS.
   No newly proposed road into a subdivision off of an existing county-, city-
or state-maintained road will be accepted by the county for maintenance, unless
street lights have been installed by the applicable utility company to the
utility’s specifications at the expense of the developer at the entrance of
such road into the subdivision, unless otherwise approved by the County Fiscal
Court.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.08 ENCROACHMENT APPROVAL.
   All entrances onto a county-maintained road shall be required to have
encroachment approval by the County Planning Director or the County Road
Superintendent to assure a safe sight distance. All entrances shall have
installed an adequate culvert or other method to handle drainage. This approval
will be affixed to the building permit.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
ORPHAN ROADS
§ 151.20 DEFINITION.
   ORPHAN ROAD is defined as a given roadway located in the county, outside the
corporate limits of the City of Frankfort, not presently being maintained by
any governmental entity, having at least ten permanent single-family residences
suitable for human occupancy per mile of said roadway, and which has been laid
off as a public road and used without restriction by the general public for at
least 15 consecutive years immediately prior to the petition for adoption as
required by KRS Ch. 178.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.21 CONSIDERATION.
   The Fiscal Court shall give consideration to adopt an orphan road; provided
that, more than 55% of the property owners on the roadway have petitioned the
Court to adopt an orphan road into the county road system and more than 55% of
the property owners abutting the roadway have signed a petition stating that
they are willing to dedicate the road for public use.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.22 REPORT TO THE COURT.
   Upon presentation of the petition set forth in §
151.21 of this chapter, the County Judge/Executive shall appoint two viewers,
who, along with the County Road Engineer, shall view the ground and make a
written report to the Court stating the advantages and disadvantages to the
public and the petitioners from the proposed work, including grades and
bearings as well as other facts and circumstances that may enable the Court to
determine whether the work should be undertaken by the county. The viewers and
the County Road Engineer shall state out in their report whether such road
should be established. The report shall further state whether it would be
necessary to take any burial ground, orchard, yard or any part thereof or to
destroy or injure buildings. The report shall also state the probable costs of
the work, as well as list the name of the land owners whose property would be
damaged by the improvements of the existing roadway, and which property owner
or owners (if any) should be required compensation and the extent to which they
would be entitled.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.23 VIEWING BY THE COURT.
   If it appears from the report that the interest of the public would be
furthered by adoption of the orphan road, the member of the Court shall
personally examine the proposed work.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.24 NOTICE AND PUBLIC HEARING.
   If, after the report and viewing by the members of the Court, the Court then
decides to further consider to adopt the orphan road, the Judge/Executive shall
appoint a date for a hearing to allow interested parties to present further
information and shall cause public notice to be given of the date and time of
the hearing.
(Ord. 9 (2006), passed 9-1-2006)
§ 151.25 ADOPTION BY REFERENCE.
   If, upon completion of the report, viewing and public hearing, the Court
adopts, by ordinance, the roadway, the road shall be established as follows.
   (A)   Right-of-way. A minimum right-of-way of 30 feet (15 feet from
centerline) shall be conveyed by the adjoining property owners to the county,
unless the Fiscal Court finds that due to topography or otherwise, the 30-foot
minimum cannot be met. Said right-of-way may be cleared, graded and sloped to
provide an adequate width for the roadway, adequate drainage and sight
distance, with the approval of the County Road Superintendent.
   (B)   Roadbed condition. The County Road Department shall prepare the
roadbed by providing an eight-inch stone base dense grade aggregate, a minimum
width of 14 feet and a double chip seal standard. The adjoining property owners
shall pay in advance for all materials and the county will furnish all labor
and equipment to bring said roadbed to this standard.
   (C)   Conditions. Anything beyond the normal scope of work (i.e., grading,
ditching and the like) shall be added to the cost of the adjoining land owners,
according to the Road Superintendent’s recommendation.
   (D)   Limits of liability for pre-existing objects in right-of-way. The
county will not be responsible for replacement or cost of fences, trees or any
other object that is in said right-of-way. The County Fiscal Court, at its
discretion, may or may not accept roads that meet these requirements.

§ 152.08 ENFORCEMENT.
   The County Planning and Zoning Department or his or her duly authorized
designees shall be responsible for the enforcement of this chapter and have the
authority to issue notices of violation (NOVs), citations and levy fines, as
described below.
   (A)   General. Enforcement procedures may be utilized if any of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   Structural and/or non-structural BMPs are not being installed or
maintained per manufacturer’s specifications and/or the county;
      (2)   Construction is not in compliance with the approved storm water
management plan;
      (3)   Maintenance of permanent storm water BMPs is not sufficient after
construction; or
      (4)   Any of the conditions of this chapter are not being met.
   (B)   Enforcement procedures.
      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, a NOV and/or citation is official
by posting a copy of the notice of violation and/or citation on the
construction site in reasonable proximity to a location where the violation is
taking place. Additionally, a copy of the violation and/or order shall be
mailed by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to the address listed by the
responsible party on the operation and maintenance agreement. In the case of
work for which there is no operation and maintenance agreement, a copy of the
violation and/or order shall be mailed to the person listed as the landowner of
the property.
      (2)   NOVs are the first level of enforcement and do not include a
penalty or fine. Only one NOV will be issued for an offense before citations
are utilized. An offense of the same nature as a previous offense, even if
previously corrected under a NOV, will constitute a second offense to be
enforced through a citation. Offenses enforced through a NOV must be corrected
within five calendar days of the date of issuance or a citation will be issued.
      (3)   For violations where no operation and maintenance agreement has
been recorded, the county will notify the property owner or responsible party
and cooperate for resolution prior to enforcement. Should the responsible party
not provide storm water structure maintenance or demonstrate a history of non-
compliance of the same nature, the county may request the County Attorney to
seek to obtain injunctive relief.
      (4)   Ten calendar days after issuing the citation, the county may issue
a notice of intent to the responsible party, landowner or land user stating the
county’s intent to perform work necessary to comply with this chapter. The
county may go on the land and commence work after 14 days from issuing the
notice of intent. The costs incurred by the county to perform this work shall
be paid by the property owner or responsible party. The cost, plus interest at
the rate authorized by the county, plus a reasonable administrative and
attorneys fee shall be billed to the property owner. Failure to reimburse the
county within 30 days of billing will result in a lien being placed on the
property.
      (5)   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter may also be enforced
by injunction.
      (6)   The county is authorized to require immediate abatement of any
violation of this chapter that constitutes an immediate threat to the health,
safety or well-being of the public. If any such violation is not abated
immediately, the county is authorized to enter onto private or public property
and to take any and all measures required to remediate the violation. Any
expense related to such remediation undertaken by the county shall be fully
reimbursed by the property owner and/or responsible party. The cost, plus
interest at the rate authorized by the county, plus a reasonable administrative
and attorneys fee shall be billed to the property owner. Failure to reimburse
the county within 30 days of billing will result in a lien being placed on the
property. For the purpose of this chapter, the ultimate party responsible for
assuring compliance with the conditions set forth is the property owner.

minimize pollution of receiving waters. The approving agency or its duly
authorized representatives shall make inspections of land-disturbing activities
subject to this chapter to ensure compliance with the approved land-disturbance
permit and to examine field practices to determine if control measures are
adequate. Authorized inspectors of the approving agency shall have the power to
inspect any land-disturbing activity and to review the records of all
inspections, repairs and modifications made by the permittee. The permittee
shall be self-policing and shall correct or remedy any EPSC measures that are
not effective or functioning properly at all times during the various phases of
construction. All updates to EPSC measures shall be accurately noted in the
SWPPP.
(Ord. 1-2018, passed 1-9-2018)
§ 153.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The issuing authority shall be responsible for the enforcement of this
chapter. Duly authorized representatives have the authority to issue notices of
violation (NOV) and stop work orders (SWO).
   (B)   A NOV and/or SWO may be posted for the entire project or any specified
part thereof if any of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   Any land-disturbance activity regulated under this chapter is being
undertaken without a permit;
      (2)   The SWPPP is not being fully implemented;
      (3)   Any of the conditions of the land-disturbance permit are not being
met; and/or
      (4)   An offense of the same nature as a previous offense, even if
previously corrected under a NOV, will constitute a second offense to be
enforced.
   (C)   For the purposes of this section, a NOV and/or SWO is validly posted
by posting a copy of the NOV and/or SWO on the site of the land-disturbing
activity in reasonable proximity to a location where the land-disturbing
activity is taking place. Additionally, a copy of the NOV and/or SWO, in the
case of work for which there is a land-disturbance permit, shall be mailed by
first class mail, postage pre-paid, to the address listed by the permittee on
the permit. In the case of work for which there is no permit, a copy of the
order shall be mailed to the person listed as the landowner of the property.
Offenses enforced through a NOV must be corrected within five calendar days of
the date of issuance or a stop work order will be issued.
   (D)   If the permittee does not comply with the SWPPP, or land-disturbance
permit conditions within five calendar days, the approving agency may revoke
the permit.
   (E)   If the landowner or developer where no land-disturbance permit has
been issued does not cease the land-disturbance activity, the approving agency
may request the County Attorney to seek to obtain injunctive relief.
   (F)   Upon revocation of permit, the permittee shall bring the site back
into compliance prior to re-inspection by the county. If the site is found
acceptable, and receipt of any subsequent fines or penalties, the county will
reinstate the permit.
   (G)   Ten calendar days after posting a stop work order, the approving
agency may issue a notice of intent to the permittee, landowner or land user
the approving agency’s intent to perform work necessary to comply with this
chapter. The approving agency may go on the land and commence work after 14
days from issuing the notice of intent the costs incurred by the approving
agency to perform this work shall be paid by the landowner or permittee. In the
event no EPSC permit was issued or no bond was posted, the cost, plus a
reasonable administrative and attorneys fee shall be billed to the owner.
   (H)   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter may also be enforced by
injunction.
   (I)   The approving agency is authorized to require immediate abatement of
any violation of this chapter that constitutes an immediate threat to the
health, safety or well-being of the public. If any such violation is not abated
immediately, the issuing authority is authorized to enter onto private or
public property and to take any and all measures required to remediate the
violation. Any expense related to such remediation undertaken by the issuing
authority shall be fully reimbursed by the property owner and/or responsible
party.
(Ord. 1-2018, passed 1-9-2018)
§ 153.08 COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER PERMITS AND ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   The requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements,
and where any provisions of this chapter impose restrictions different from
those imposed by any other applicable ordinance, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher
protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to
take precedence.

§ 155.049 DIMENSIONAL VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide on applications for
dimensional variances where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness,
shallowness or unusual shape of a site on the date of adoption or amendment of
this chapter or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or some other
extraordinary situation or condition of that site, the literal enforcement of
the dimensional requirements (height or width of building or size of yards, but
not population density) of this zoning regulation would deprive the applicant
of reasonable capacity to make use of the land in a manner equivalent to the
use permitted other landowners in the same zone. The Board may impose any
reasonable conditions or restrictions on any variance it decides to grant.
   (B)   Before any variance is granted, the Board must find all of the
following which shall be recorded along with any imposed conditions or
restrictions in minutes and records and issued in written form to the applicant
to constitute proof of the dimensional variance:
      (1)   The specific conditions in detail which are unique to the
applicant’s land and do not exist on other land in the same zone;
      (2)   The manner in which the strict application of the provisions of
this zoning regulation would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of land
in the manner equivalent to the use permitted over landowners in the same zone;
      (3)   The unique conditions and circumstances are not the result of
actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption or amendment of this
chapter;
      (4)   Reasons that the variance will preserve, not harm the public safety
and welfare, and will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
and, if within a floodplain zone would not increase the flood heights; and
      (5)   For dimensional variances of lowest floor elevations (including
basement) from the regulatory flood elevation in a flood fringe district only:
the property on which the structure is to be located is an isolated lot of one-
half acre or less, contiguous to and surrounded by existing structures
constructed below such required first floor elevation or a structure listed on
the National Register of Historic Places is to be restored or reconstructed.
   (C)   A dimensional variance applied to the property for which it is granted
and not the individual who applied for it. A variance also runs with the land
and is transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be
transferred by the applicant to a different site.

and site plan regulations.
         (c)   The submittal deadlines for applications to be revised and
considered by the Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission shall be
established by the Commission as necessary to facilitate adequate review by the
staff and proper notification of adjoining property owners and the public of
items placed on the agenda.
      (7)   Notice of public hearing. Notice of the date, time, place and
reason for holding a public hearing shall be given by one publication in the

§ 155.072 ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS; COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION.
   (A)   (1)   Before making recommendation to the Fiscal Court of the county
that an application for amendment to the Zoning Map be granted, the Commission
shall find that the map amendment is in agreement with the Comprehensive Plan
adopted by the Commission, or, in the absence of such a finding that:
         (a)   The original zoning classification given to the property was
inappropriate or improper; or
         (b)   There have been major changes of an economic, physical or social
nature within the area involved which were not anticipated in the Comprehensive
Plan adopted by the Commission and which have substantially altered the basic
character of such area.
      (2)   The findings of fact made by the Commission shall be recorded in
the minutes and records of the Commission.
   (B)   After voting to recommend that an application for amendment to the
Zoning Map be granted or denied, the Commission shall forward its findings of
fact and recommendation in writing to the Fiscal Court of the county.

§ 155.073 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF ZONE AND DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zones and districts as

   (A)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
   (C)   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to
be midway between the main tracks.
   (D)   (1)   Boundaries indicated as following shore lines shall be construed
to follow such shore lines, and in the event of change in the shore lines shall
be construed as moving with the actual shore line.
      (2)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streams, rivers, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow
such centerlines.
   (E)   (1)   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in divisions (A) through (D) above shall be so construed.
      (2)   Distances not specifically indicated on the Zoning Map atlas shall
be determined by the scale of the map.
   (F)   Where a zone or district boundary line divides a lot which was in
single ownership at the time of passage of the regulations, the Board of Zoning
Adjustments may permit, as a conditional use, the extensions of the regulations
for either portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the zone or district
line into the remaining portion of the lot.
   (G)   Where the above-stated rules do not indicate the exact location of the
zone or district boundaries, then said boundaries shall be determined by appeal
before the Board of Zoning Adjustments as provided by §§
155.045 through

§ 155.086 SPECIAL DISTRICTS.
   In addition to the basic zoning districts which are intended to be
established in predominantly developed sections of the county, a series or
flexible zones may be established:
   (A)   To consider special or unique character of an existing area;
   (B)   To consider certain environmental problems: floodways and floodway

districts and mixed use districts.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.02)
§ 155.087 SPECIAL DISTRICTS GOVERNED BY PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   Inasmuch as these districts are less guided by specified permitted uses and
more dependent upon performance standards, the use table does not specify
permitted uses in special districts. Where special districts are applied, their
use and conditions are explained in the text.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.03)

district, subject only to site plan approval.
   (D)   If a number appears, the use is permitted, subject to certain
conditions that are explained at the end of the use table. Each number refers
to a condition identified by the same number.
   (E)   If a “C” appears, that use is a conditional use requiring approval of
the Board of Zoning Adjustments. Reference should be made in §§
155.105 through
155.123 of this chapter.

§ 155.111 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose and location. A home occupation is an accessory use which is
incidental to the use of the dwelling for residential purposes. Regulations
governing home occupations are intended to protect residential districts from
commercial encroachment, maintain the character of the neighborhood, prevent an
undue increase in traffic or parking problems on local streets, but at the same
time provide a means for individuals to operate businesses customarily
conducted from private homes. Such permits may be granted in any zoning
district where residences are permitted.
   (B)   Classification. Home occupations will be categorized into two
different types: minor home occupations and major home occupations. Minor home
occupations may be administratively approved; provided that, the applicant
meets all criteria set forth in this section. Major home occupations shall
require a conditional use permit by the Board of Zoning Adjustments prior to
the issuance of a business license.
      (1)   (a)   Minor home occupations may be administratively approved when
the following conditions are met.

engaged or employed in the home occupation.
            2.   There shall be no visible exterior evidence of the conduct of
the occupation.
            3.   No advertisement shall be placed in any media (newspaper,
magazine, telephone directory, radio television) containing the address to the
property.
            4.   No customers/students/clients will be allowed on site.
            5.   The home occupation shall not create the need for off-street
parking beyond normal dwelling needs and will not generate additional traffic.
         (b)   No business license shall be issued for the conduct of a minor
home occupation until the applicant has shown that all criteria and conditions
of this section have been met.
      (2)   Major home occupations shall require approval of a conditional use
permit from the Board of Zoning Adjustments. In order for the Board of Zoning
Adjustments to approve a major home occupation, the following conditions must
be met.
         (a)   Employees working or meeting at the home occupation site shall
be limited to persons who reside in the dwelling unit; except that, one non-
resident employee shall be permitted to be at the site at any one time.
         (b)   No more than two customers, clients or pupils shall be permitted
on the site at any one time; except that, an occupant of a single-family
dwelling may provide group or professional therapy for no more than four
individuals at one time.
         (c)   Any major home occupation that accommodates customers, clients
or pupils on the site shall not be permitted to operate between the hours of 9:
00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.

the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.

sign not exceeding two square feet in area, and this sign shall not be free-
standing.

using tractor-trailers. No more than two commercial deliveries (e.g., UPS,
Federal Express and U.S. Postal Service Express Mail) shall be made in any 24-
hour period.
   (C)   Permit. No business license for a major home occupation shall be
issued unless either a conditional use permit has been issued by the Board of
Zoning Adjustments for major home occupation or, in the case of minor home
occupations, the applicant has shown that all conditions listed under this
section have been met.
   (D)   Permit, not transferable. A special permit for a home occupation is
not transferable. A new permit must be applied for whenever there is a change
in the occupations, occupant or address.
   (E)   Retail activities. Generally, only handmade items, crafts made in the
home and sale items in conjunction with the services may be offered for sale on
the premises. No other goods, products or commodities bought for the express
purpose of resale shall be sold at retail or wholesale on the premises, nor
shall such goods or products be stored or displayed on the premises or
distributed to other locations. This provision is not meant to prohibit the
storage of goods sold through a mail-order or online sales business as long as
the storage of those goods does not violate any other provision of this
regulation.
   (F)   Occupation types.
      (1)   The following uses are prohibited as home occupations: barber
shops; beauty parlors; automobile and small engine repair; medical or dental
office, other than psychiatry/psychology; home cooking and catering; private

activity that is proposed as a home occupation is not specifically listed as
prohibited, but has characteristics of a use or uses that are listed and could
negatively impact the residential character of the neighborhood in which it is
proposed, then that use/activity shall be prohibited as a home occupation. Such
determinations may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Adjustments.
      (3)   Note: agriculture-related “homebased processing and
microprocessing” taking place in accordance with HB391 and KRS 217.005 through
KRS 217.215 shall not be prohibited by the preceding list of occupation types.
   (G)   Limitation on area. The use of the dwelling for the home occupation
shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to the use of the dwelling for
residential purposes. A home occupation shall occupy less than 50% of the floor
area of the principal dwelling unit, when the occupation is located in an
accessory structure the area of the accessory structure may be counted towards
the floor area of the principal dwelling unit.
   (H)   Location. The operation of home occupations shall be limited to the
dwelling unit (including the basement and attached garage) and one roofed and
fully enclosed accessory structure located on the site.
   (I)   Parking. Parking facilities required by this chapter have been
provided and shall not alter the residential character of the lot.
   (J)   Alteration of structure. No residential structure shall be altered or
added to in such a manner that the alteration would conflict with the
residential nature of the structure were no home occupation in use.
   (K)   No products or processing. Except for the creation and production of
arts and crafts, there shall be no good, samples, materials or objects sold,
stored, displayed, manufactured or processed on the premises in connection with
the operation; however, this section shall not prohibit dressmaking or
tailoring wherein goods are not manufactured or processed as stock for sale or
distribution, nor shall it prohibit the production and incidental sale of arts
and crafts which have been created by the occupant of the premises.
   (L)   Fire rating. No electrical or mechanical equipment or processes that
would change the fire rating of the dwelling unit shall be permitted. No home
occupation may cause odor, vibrations, fumes or glare which is beyond the scope
of odors, vibration, fumes or glare which could result from typical behaviors
in a residential setting. In the case of electrical interference, no equipment
or process shall be used which creates visual or audible interference in any
radio or television receivers off the premises, or causes fluctuations in line
voltage off the premises.

§ 155.151 RURAL HERITAGE MIXED USE DISTRICT (HD).
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the Rural Heritage Mixed Use District (HD) is
to facilitate the preservation of the county's significant historic resources
that are under pressure due to adjacent incompatible development, proposed
future development, or existing underutilization and neglect. The goal is to
prevent the loss of historic, cultural, and heritage sites by incorporating
compatible mixed-use development that promotes tourism, economic vitality, and
complements the historic character of the district. The aim is to allow
adaptive re-use of significant historic buildings and introduce new uses at an
intensity and scale that fit into the environs in a balanced and compatible
manner, fostering a vibrant and sustainable district that celebrates its unique
heritage assets.
   (B)   Intent of general uses. The intent of the Rural Heritage Mixed Use
District (HD) is to function in a compatible manner that enhances the
attractiveness of the district as a destination. This regulation does not
presuppose all potential permitted used. General uses could include:
      (1)   Tourism-oriented facilities such as hotels, bed and breakfasts,
inns, conferences centers/meeting halls, amphitheater and museums;
      (2)   Commercial activities such as retail, galleries, craft studios,
restaurants, and cafes;
      (3)   Production facilities such as distilleries, storage/warehousing,
breweries, wineries, vineyards, orchards; agricultural and food production;
      (4)   Recreational amenities such as hiking trails, parks, gardens,
rides/attractions, and other leisure opportunities;
      (5)   Other uses not contemplated may be deemed appropriate.
   (C)   Eligibility to apply for zoning change to HD. A proposed Rural
Heritage Mixed Use District (HD) must contain one or more historic resources
that are currently listed or eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) that are currently vacant, abandoned, underutilized, or located
in an area where adjacent future land uses are not favorable to the continued
preservation of the resource(s). Eligibility of non-NRHP-listed or non-NRHP-
eligible resources shall be determined by a professional meeting or exceeding
the professional who 1) is retained by contract or employed by the Fiscal Court
or Planning Commission and 2) meets or exceeds qualifications standards set by
the Secretary of the Interior. Their analysis shall include an assessment of
the levels of significance and integrity of all identified primary and
accessory/associated resources existing on the property(ies).
   (D)   Development plan and historic preservation review process.
      (1)   The Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission shall hear
applications requesting a zone map amendment to rezone to Rural Heritage Mixed
Use District (HD). The request shall include the following items to be
considered:
         (a)   Legal descriptions or plat of properties subject to the rezoning
to establish district boundaries.
         (b)   A conceptual plan depicting the proposed development layout. The
conceptual plan should show approximate placement of new buildings and roads.
It should identify existing features that are proposed to be demolished. Uses
of the existing and new buildings should be labeled.
         (c)   A detailed written description of the proposed development that
includes an explanation of the historic significance and integrity of the
primary building, structure, and/or site, as well as any accessory/associated
resources, and how the proposed development will incorporate those resources
into a cohesive heritage tourism destination.
         (d)   A list containing the proposed uses including primary uses and
ancillary uses shall be approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Preliminary development plan will be required for approval by the
Planning Commission. The preliminary development plan shall include roads,
parking, new buildings, existing buildings and historic resources, drainage
features, topographical slope, and natural features such as streams, woodlands,
and wetlands. It shall also include changes such as structures to be
demolished, proposed grading, and removal of trees as well as to identify areas
that will be preserved for rural and agricultural uses. The preliminary
development plan may be submitted in lieu of the conceptual plan under division
(D)(1)(b) above if submitted in conjunction with zone map amendment request and
satisfies the requirements of this section herein.
      (3)   Final development plan and historic preservation review approval is
required.
         (a)   Development plan approval shall include all requirements for a
development plan as found in §§
155.190 through
155.196. The lot area, lot width, yard and usable open space requirements do
not apply to Rural Heritage Mixed Use Districts. The siting and location of
buildings, improvements, structures and common open spaces within the area of
the Rural Heritage Mixed Use District shall be controlled by the development
plans which are approved for the Rural Heritage Mixed Use District.
         (b)   A report shall be developed by a qualified professional meeting
the requirements of division (C) above and will include the application of the
development guidelines contained in division (E) below of this section to
determine the appropriateness of the proposed treatments, alterations, and
design of new construction on property of the NRHP-listed or NRHP-eligible
resources. The report will be provided to the Planning Commission to assist
them with its historic preservation review.
         (c)   The Planning Commission chairperson or staff will review and
have authority for approval of the final development plan. If there have been
significant changes between the preliminary and final development plan then the
Planning Commission will review and have authority for approval. It will also
consider the review report from division (D)(3)(b) above for conditions to be
included in final approval.
   (E)   Development guidelines. The character, scale and aesthetics of the
proposed development shall be compatible with the cultural and rural nature of
the site. Preservation of NRHP-listed or NRHP-eligible historic buildings and
associated contributing elements shall be required and proposed changes to the
exterior of these buildings shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning
Commission. Demolition of the primary historic resource shall not be permitted.
Relocation of accessory or associated resources may be permitted. Demolition of
accessory/associated resources may be permitted if the resources lack historic
significance or integrity. Rehabilitation of the exterior of the historic
buildings and their environs shall follow these design standards, which are to
be applied in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration the significance
and integrity of each resource, in addition to economic and technical
feasibility:
      (1)   The adaptive re-use of the historic building should require minimal
change to the defining characteristics of the building, the site, and
environment immediately adjacent. The placement of mixed-use structures in the
district should respect the historic character of the historic site.
      (2)   The character of the historic buildings should be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property should be avoided, if possible.
      (3)   Each property should be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, should not be undertaken.
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right should be preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property should be
preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features should be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of the deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature should match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Missing
features should be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial
evidence.
      (7)   Consideration for the potential to find significant archeological
resources in the vicinity of the rehabilitation should be given.
      (8)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
should not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      (9)   New additions should be undertaken in such a manner that if removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and
its environment would be unimpaired.
   (F)   Enforcement. Violations of any portion of this regulation shall be
subject to fines, penalties, and enforcement actions in accordance with §
155.025 and §
155.031.
(Ord. 8-2024, passed 8-6-2024)
E-ZL, EXCLUSIVE USE ZONE FOR LANDFILL
§ 155.165 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Exclusive Use Zone for Landfills is to reclassify
landfill activities from particular industrial zones to an exclusive use zone
intended to:
   (A)   Protect public health by preventing water pollution, rodent
infestation, air pollution or other health hazards as would occur as a result
of improper location, design or operation of a landfill;
   (B)   Protect public safety by requiring proper design of access streets to
accommodate the heavy equipment necessary for collection, transportation and
disposal of solid wastes;
   (C)   Improve compatibility with adjacent uses by requiring adequate
screening and setbacks, regular policing of access roads and heavily traveled
routes to the site and careful review of subsequent uses allowed on the
landfill site; and
   (D)   Promote public welfare by providing a suitable location for the
disposal of the solid wastes generated by the community.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.601; Ord. 3-2002, passed 5-3-2002)
§ 155.166 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   LANDFILL.
      (1)   A community facility, which is a necessary part of the community’s
waste disposal system. The high volume of heavy truck traffic and the
associated noise, odor and other potential nuisance-like characteristics
suggest industrial zoning would be appropriate. However, the LANDFILL is a
limited duration use and the filled land may not be suitable for industrial
uses, which require substantial weight bearing foundations. This limitation
makes industrial zoning inappropriate for subsequent uses to be located on this
land. Major factors in determining proper site location are the suitability of
the soil and underground drainage systems and they are not usually factors in
the location of industrial zones. There the site location criteria for a
LANDFILL must be defined separately.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.602)
      (2)   A method of disposing of refuse on land without creating nuisances
or hazards to public health or safety by utilizing the principles of
engineering to confine the refuse to the smallest practical area, to reduce it
to the smallest practical volume, and to cover it with a layer of suitable
cover material at the conclusion of each day’s operation or at more or less
frequent intervals as necessary and in compliance with all requirements and
regulations of this chapter, and with all requirements and regulations of the
commonwealth. This includes sanitary “contained” landfills, “construction/
demolition debris” landfills, “residual” landfills and “incinerator”
facilities, as defined by the regulations of the commonwealth.
   OPEN DUMP. A site where refuse is dumped which, due to lack of control, may
create a breeding places for flies and rats, may cause air or water pollution
or may catch fire.
   QUALIFIED GEOLOGIST. A qualified geologist shall have a masters degree in
geology from an accredited university or college and have experience in
hydrogeology.
   SANITARY (CONTAINED) LANDFILL. A type of landfill which may accept for
disposal all non-hazardous solid wastes and limited quantities of household
hazardous waste, industrial waste and generator hazardous waste. SANITARY
LANDFILLS shall operate in compliance with all requirements and regulations of
this chapter and with all requirements and regulations of the commonwealth.
   SOLID WASTE(S). All putrescible and non-putrescible refuse in solid form.
“Solid” includes, but is not limited to, garbage, rubbish, ashes, incinerator
residue, street refuse, dead animals, demolition wastes, construction wastes,
solid commercial and industrial wastes and special wastes including explosives,
pathological wastes and radioactive materials.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.616; Ord. 3-2002, passed 5-3-2002)
§ 155.167 NEED FOR SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   If proper landfill standards are not adhered to, the operation may result in
an open dump and create a serious health hazard. A completed landfill will
settle and will require periodic maintenance. Because of this settlement
factor, special design and construction techniques must be utilized for
building constructed on a completed landfill. As a result of the factors listed
above, sanitary landfills must be placed in an exclusive use zone, which
includes specific design standards and appropriate protection for subsequent
use.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.603; Ord. 3-2002, passed 5-3-2002)
§ 155.168 PLANNING FOR THE LANDFILL.
   (A)   Due to the potentially adverse environmental impact of a landfill,
geologic and soils reports, a topographic map and a preliminary operational
plan shall be required with the application for appropriate zoning. The
Planning Commission may recommend approval of and the County Fiscal Court may
grant the change to the zoning for E-ZL zoning based on the information in the
geologic and soils reports and a preliminary operational plan showing how any
site problems could be resolved; and, provided that, the site size requirements
and the site design standards can be met.
   (B)   Any application for an E-ZL Zone District must also obtain the
necessary permits from federal, state and local agencies having jurisdiction
over any phase of operation. No landfill construction shall commence until a
landfill construction permit has been issued by the Division of Waste
Management of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet and no
landfill operation shall begin until the permit to operate has been issued by
the Division of Waste Management of the Natural Resources and Environmental
Protection Cabinet and submitted to the Frankfort/Franklin County Planning
Commission, through the Franklin County Planning, Zoning and Building Code
Enforcement office. The Planning Commission shall withhold any approval until
the applicant has demonstrated compliance with the site development and
operational standards contained herein.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.604; Ord. 3-2002, passed 5-3-2002)
§ 155.169 REPORTS AND SITE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONAL PLANS.
   (A)   Detailed plans, specifications, maps and reports shall be submitted in
triplicate to the Planning Commission for review. The data in the following
reports should be prepared in a form, which facilitates its use in proper
engineering design of the landfill. Problem areas must be delineated and
recommendations for proper solution included in the report. The plans,
specifications and maps for the operational plan may be submitted in the manner
required by the permitting regulations of the Division of Waste Management of
the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet for solid waste

   Landfill facilities shall be designed in accordance with this chapter by a
registered civil engineer whose certification shall appear on all plans and
specifications in the same manner as required by the Frankfort/Franklin County
Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.606; Ord. 3-2002, passed 5-3-2002)
§ 155.171 OTHER PERMITS REQUIRED.

and Environmental Protection Cabinet must issue permits for disposal of all
solid waste, except where a person is disposing of solid waste from his or her
own household on his or her own property.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.607; Ord. 3-2002, passed 5-3-2002)
§ 155.172 SITE LOCATION STANDARDS.
   The following site location standards must be met if at all possible, for
they are designed to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and these
standards must be balanced against the community’s need to dispose of its solid
waste and the total environmental and economic costs of such disposal.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 4.608; Ord. 3-2002, passed 5-3-2002)
§ 155.173 SOIL AND GEOLOGIC CRITERIA.
   (A)   General. Any landfill should be located on a site, which has suitable
soil, hydrologic and geologic characteristics. Areas with karst topographic
features may pose significant problems for proposed landfill sites. Any
problems inherent in such a site must be demonstrated as capable of a
satisfactory engineering solution. Therefore, there is a need for a soil report
and a geologic report to determine if the soil, hydrologic and geologic
characteristics meet required standards.
   (B)   Soil characteristics. A field survey must be made to determine that
the site has:
      (1)   Sufficient impermeable material to form a seal between the base of
the landfill and bedrock, and if the site is located above the kind of
subsurface stratification which could leachate from the landfill to water
sources, then impervious material must separate the landfill from unacceptable
bedrock in accordance with the requirements and regulations of the
commonwealth;
      (2)   Sufficient soil suitable for cover material with good workability
and compaction characteristics;
      (3)   Slopes of less than 12%; and
      (4)   No flooding problems and is not within either a 100-year or 500-
year base flood elevation, as determined by the National Flood Insurance
Program, Flood Insurance Rate Maps for the county.

§
155.999
§ 155.174 GEOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS.
   (A)   To prevent potential ground and surface water pollution, the site must
be located in an area where no pollutants can enter the water supply. The
ground water table must be located and the site designed to prevent its
pollution. The site must be free of potential flooding problems and karst
topographic features, which would erode the cover material or interfere with
operation of the landfill.
   (B)   To eliminate the possibility of either surface or ground water
pollution, the site should:
      (1)   Be located a safe distance from sinkholes, streams, lakes, wells
and other water sources;
      (2)   Avoid being located above the kind of subsurface stratification
that will lead the leachate from the landfill to water sources (i.e., fractured
limestone);
      (3)   Use an earth cover that is nearly impervious; and
      (4)   Provide suitable drainage to carry surface water away from the
site. Grading, diking, terracing, diversion details or tiling may be approved,
where appropriate.

§
155.999
§ 155.175 SITE SIZE REQUIREMENTS.
   The volume of space required is primarily dependent upon the character and
quantity of the solid wastes, the efficiency of compaction of the wastes, the
depth of the fill and the desired life of the landfill. These factors must be
weighed in determining the appropriate size of the landfill.

§
155.999
§ 155.177 ACCESSIBILITY.
   The site should be easily reached by highways or arterial roads. All roads
to the site should be of sufficient width and constructed to safely handle all
sizes of trucks when fully loaded during all weather conditions. Problems such
as narrow bridges, low underpasses and steep grades on access routes must be
avoided.

§
155.999
§ 155.178 SITE DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following design features shall be incorporated into the site plans for
a landfill.
   (A)   Access design and on-site roads.
      (1)   Particular attention must be given to proper, safe design of
entrances and exits, with provision for right turn deceleration lanes,
protected left turn lanes, acceleration lanes and, if needed, signalization of
the intersection.
      (2)   Since the site should be accessible at all times, it is desirable
to have several access routes so that if one route is temporarily unusable, the
site can still be used.
      (3)   Distance of driveway entrance or exit from any adjacent lot line
should be at least 125 feet, except for lots across the arterial road, off of
which the access drive is located. Any portion of such access drive within 150
feet of the public street shall be paved or treated so as to be free of dust.
      (4)   The on-site roads to within 200 feet of the unloading area should
be of all-weather construction and wide enough to permit two-way truck travel.
Road grades should be designed for the largest fully-loaded trucks to travel at
a reasonable rate. It is particularly important at large sites that traffic in
and out of the area flow smoothly.
   (B)   Fencing and landscaping. The landfill area shall be enclosed with a
substantial wall, fence or other adequate barrier at least five feet in height,
to control access to the landfill site. The entrance gate must be capable of
being locked and posted. A landscape strip, at least 50 feet in width shall be
provided and maintained between the lot line and the waste boundary of the
landfill. The Planning Commission may expand the size of the landscape strip to
include a natural buffer such as an existing tree line. The required landscape
strip shall consist of a triple row, staggered, planting of evergreen trees, at
15 feet on center, which are a minimum of six feet in height at the time of
planting. Existing tree stands may be considered by the Planning Commission as
meeting this buffer requirement if, in the opinion of the county’s Engineer,
the existing tree stands will provide the same amount or greater buffer than
the required landscape planting strip.
   (C)   Signs and directions. Only necessary identification and directional
signs shall be permitted. If the site is open to the public, a sign shall be
posted at the entrances to inform the public of the hours of operation, cost of
disposal and rules and regulations regarding disposal. At large landfill
operations, signs should be used on the site to direct users to the appropriate
unloading area.
   (D)   Site operational standards. Operating standards to prevent adverse
health hazards and other nuisance like problems and by requirements and
regulations of the commonwealth.

§
155.999
§ 155.179 COMPLETED LANDFILL.
   (A)   Inspection. An inspection of the entire site shall be made by the
commonwealth’s Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet, Division
of Waste Management, to determine compliance with the approved plans and
specifications before earthmoving equipment is removed from the site. Any
necessary corrective work shall be performed before the landfill project is
accepted as completed. The compliance notification from the commonwealth’s
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet shall be submitted to
the county’s Planning and Zoning Office.
   (B)   Subsequent maintenance. Arrangements shall be made and appropriate
bond or irrevocable letter of credit posted to assure the repair of all cracks,
and eroded or uneven areas in the final cover following completion of the fill,
the closure of the landfill and the maintenance of the landfill after closure
in accordance with the requirements and regulations of the commonwealth. Care
must be taken to maintain good drainage and the surface contours as designed in
the approved plans. Additional fill and cover material shall be used as
necessary. The land shall be graded, backfilled and finished to a surface,
which will:
      (1)   Result in a level, sloping or gently rolling topography in
substantial conformity or desirable relationship to the original site and land
area immediately surrounding;
      (2)   Minimize erosion due to storm water runoff. Such graded or
backfilled area shall be sodded or surfaced with soil of a quality at least
equal to the topsoil of vegetation producing land areas immediately surrounding
and to a depth of at least six inches; and
      (3)   Trees, shrubs, legumes or grasses shall be planted as approved on
the site development and operational plans.
   (C)   Decomposition, settlement and underground fires.
      (1)   Decomposition, settlement and underground fires are problems, which
can occur after completion of the landfill operation. Precautions must be taken
to prevent gases produced during decomposition from concentrating in sewers or
other structures. The designer of structures to be placed on the site must
provide the means to allow the gas to dissipate to the atmosphere and not into
the structure.
      (2)   Concentrated foundation loading must be avoided to prevent
foundation cracking in structures placed on the completed fill area. However,
special engineering design such as use of pilings may be included in the plans
for subsequent structures.
      (3)   Provisions for extinguishing underground fire must be made and the
possibility of such an occurrence considered in the design of structures placed
on the site.
   (D)   Subsequent land use.
      (1)   The subsequent land use of the completed landfill site may be
determined at the time of initial approval of the landfill. However, in cases
where the location of the site, duration of its operation or transitory nature
of surrounding uses make a decision concerning subsequent use premature, this
decision may be made at the time of completion of the landfill operation.
      (2)   In all cases, the future uses determination shall be based on
consideration of the following factors:
         (a)   The relationship of the proposed use to the adopted
Comprehensive Plan and other adopted community plans;
         (b)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed use to damage resulting from
settlement and other hazards inherent in the area filled;
         (d)   The community need for the proposed use; and
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for uses proposed.

(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 6.307)
§ 155.257 APPLICATION PROCESS.
   Application for the construction of cellular antenna towers or co-location
of cellular antennas for cellular telecommunications services or personal
communications services shall be processed as follows.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   Every utility, or a company that is engaged in the business of
providing the required infrastructure to a utility, that proposes to construct
an antenna tower or co-locate an antenna for cellular telecommunications
services or personal communications services, and has officially registered
with the Public Service Commission, shall submit a copy of the utility’s
completed uniform application to the Frankfort/Franklin County Joint Planning
Commission within five consecutive days of applying to the Public Service
Commission for a certificate of necessity and convenience, as required by KRS
278.020(1).
      (2)   For applicants who are requesting co-location, all requirements in
these regulations apply.
   (B)   Co-location.
      (1)   A utility planning to co-locate its antennas on an existing tower
or to augment an existing structure to enable it to place its antennas on that
structure shall file with the Planning Office its intent to do so, including
the name and address of the utility, name of the owner of the structure, the
latitude and longitude of the structure and a description of the plan to
augment or co-locate, if:
         (a)   The proposed augmentation, if any, of the existing structure
shall not increase the height of the structure; and
         (b)   The proposed augmentation, if any, of the existing structure
will not result in altering lighting requirements for a structure on which
lighting is not currently required.
      (2)   For facilities located on previously approved sites, a
representative of the Frankfort/ Franklin County Planning Commission shall
review the application for its conformity with these regulations and the
regulations contained within this chapter. If the Planning Director determines
that the application is in conformity with these regulations and the
regulations contained within this chapter, an administrative approval may be
granted. This administrative approval shall not be considered final until it is
ratified by a vote of the full commission.
      (3)   If the Director determines that the application is not in
conformity with these regulations and the regulations contained within this
chapter, a public hearing, pursuant to division (C)(3) below, shall be
scheduled.
   (C)   Evaluation.
      (1)   The Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission, shall, within 60
days commencing from the date that the application is received by the
Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission, or within a date specified in a
written agreement between the Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission and
the applicant, make its final decision to approve or disapprove the uniform
application. The Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission shall submit to
the Public Service Commission, along with its action, the basis for its
decision, along with suggestions which, in its opinion, better accomplishes the
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and this chapter. If the Frankfort/
Franklin County Planning Commission fails to issue a final decision within 60
days, and if there is no written agreement between the Frankfort/Franklin
County Planning Commission and the utility to a specific date for the
Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission to issue a decision, it is
presumed that the Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission has approved
the utility’s uniform application. In the case that the Commission should deny
an application, the applicant would have 30 days to appeal from the time of the
Planning Commission’s “final action”.
      (2)   Whenever the Planning Commission may deny an application, it must
do so in writing. According to 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(iii), the Commission’s
written denial must be separate from the written record (i.e., separate from
the Planning Commission minutes), must describe the reasons for denial and must
contain a “sufficient explanation of the reasons for the denial to allow a
reviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the record that supports those
reasons”.
      (3)   The evaluation of the application shall include, but not be limited
to, the following criteria:
         (a)   The Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission will deny a
uniform application to construct a cellular antenna tower based on an
applicants’ unwillingness to attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or
related equipment on any new or existing towers;
         (b)   Agreement with the various elements of the Frankfort/Franklin
County Comprehensive Plan and, where applicable, any other adopted plans;
         (c)   Extent to which the proposal is consistent with the purposes of
these regulations;
         (d)   Adequacy of the proposed site, considering such factors as the
sufficiency of the size of the site to comply with the established design
standards listed in §§
155.254 and
155.255 of this chapter;
         (e)   Extent to which the proposal responds to the impact of the
proposed development on adjacent land uses, especially in terms of visual
impact. The Commission shall have substantial evidence, presented at a public
hearing in order to deny an application based upon visual impact; and
         (f)   Extent to which the proposed facility is integrated with
existing structures or the extent to which the proposed cellular antenna tower
uses stealth technology.
   (D)   Amendments. Any amendments to the site development plans, except for
minor adjustments as determined by the Frankfort/Franklin County Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, shall be made in accordance
with the procedure required by division (C) above, subject to the same
limitations and requirements as those under which such plans were originally
approved.

Franklin County Planning Commission, a letter of credit, a performance bond or
other security acceptable to the Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission
in the amount equal to the cost of demolition and removal of the facility. An
applicant having multiple telecommunications facilities within the Frankfort/
Franklin County Planning Commission’s jurisdiction may deposit a single
guarantee in the amount equal to the cost of demolition and removal of the one
facility it owns which would cost the most to demolish and remove until such
time as the number of its multiple facilities exceeds four such facilities. At
such time as the approved number of the applicant’s multiple facilities exceeds
four such facilities, the applicant shall increase the amount on deposit to an
amount equal to the cost of the most costly demolition and removal, plus 25% of
the cost of demolition and removal of the applicant’s other existing
facilities. Any guarantee submitted shall be irrevocable and shall provide for
the Frankfort/ Franklin County Planning Commission to collect the full amount
of the guarantee if the applicant fails to maintain the guarantee.
   (C)   If the use of any cellular antenna or cellular antenna tower or
alternative cellular antenna tower structure is discontinued, the owner shall
provide the Frankfort/Franklin County Planning Commission with a copy of the
notice to the FCC of intent to cease operations within 30 days of such notice
to the FCC. If the cellular antenna or cellular antenna tower or alternative
cellular antenna tower structure will not be reused, the owner shall have 180
days from submittal of the FCC notice to the Frankfort/Franklin County Planning
Commission to obtain a demolition permit and remove the antenna or tower that
will not be reused. If the cellular antenna or cellular antenna tower or
alternative cellular antenna tower structure is to be reused, the owner shall
have no more that 12 months from submittal of the FCC notice to the Frankfort/
Franklin County Planning Commission in which to commence new operation of the
antenna or tower to be reused. Upon failure to commence new operation of the
antenna or cellular antenna tower or alternative cellular antenna tower, the
structure shall be presumed abandoned, and the owner shall obtain within 90
days of the expiration of the 12-month period, a demolition permit and remove
the antenna or tower that is presumed abandoned within 60 days of obtaining the
demolition permit. If the owner fails to remove an antenna or tower in the time
provided by this division (C), the Frankfort/Franklin County Planning
Commission may, on grounds of public safety, health and welfare, cause the
demolition and removal of the antenna or tower and recover its costs of
demolition and removal.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 155.275 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to encourage flexibility in the
development of land in order: to promote its most appropriate use; to improve
design, character and quality of new developments; to facilitate the adequate
and economic provision of streets and utilities; and to preserve the natural
and scenic features of open areas alongside major developments.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 7.01)
§ 155.276 DEFINITION.
   A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT involves a project area devoted to a particular
group of uses; residential, commercial or industrial or a mixture of uses,
located on a lot or contiguous group of lots held under single, joint or common
ownership.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 7.02)
§ 155.277 DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS; APPLICABILITY.
   The lot area, lot width, yard and usable open space requirements of this
chapter shall not apply to planned unit developments. The siting and location
of buildings, improvements, structures and common open spaces within the area

   Areas in the county may be designated by the Fiscal Court upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
   (A)   An area may be zoned if the original request for such designation is
made by the Fiscal Court or by the Planning Commission. When a planned area is
so zoned, any construction or development proposed shall have a development
plan submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission before any building
permit may be issued. Since any such zoned area may encompass several lots
under several ownerships, the Planning Commission may approve individual
development plans for individual parcels; providing, they first assure that
each plan so approved is interrelated with plans for adjoining parcels or is
capable of being extended to adjoining parcels of land.
   (B)   An area may be zoned as a planned development based upon applications
for such designation by an owner, developer or contiguous owners or developers.
Such application shall include:
      (1)   Preliminary development plan. This plan shall include all
requirements for a preliminary development plan as found in §§
155.190 through
155.196 of this chapter and shall include all the area designated as a planned
unit; and
      (2)   Written statement. The written statement to accompany the
preliminary development plan shall contain the following information:
         (a)   Description of the planned development;
         (b)   Land ownership; and
         (c)   Relationship to surrounding neighborhood.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 155.295 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the commonwealth has, in KRS 67.084, delegated to local
government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
Fiscal Court of the county hereby adopts the following floodplain management
provisions.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.1)
§ 155.296 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation, which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.1)
§ 155.297 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.1)
§ 155.298 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this subchapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.1)
§ 155.299 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination
of both. In A ZONES, flood waters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are
usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base
flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   A1-30 AND AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.

and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this subchapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO AND AR/A ZONES. Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   A99 ZONE. The part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three
feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood, which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year. (Also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD.) BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this subchapter.

level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground,
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank or other human-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for STRUCTURE.
   C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES. Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular
program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated or qualified community
official) from available technical studies, historical information and other
available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by
flood waters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or

specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD. The flood that has a 0.2% chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to
low risk of flooding.
   FLOOD, FLOODING or FLOOD WATER.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See MUDSLIDES.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See FLOOD-
RELATED EROSION.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing
flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and/or the Flood Boundary
Floodway Map (FBFM) and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by flood waters from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This subchapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOOD-PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOOD-PROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is water-tight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. The area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory
floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/
or hydrologic analysis.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
155.317 of this chapter, the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the Fiscal Court
will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100
years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components and the like.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or

shipbuilding, ship repair or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit (i.e., county or municipality) that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood-routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a

states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).
      (1)   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, flood-proof, demolish
or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KRS 151.250. Plans for dams, levees and the like to be approved and permit
issued by Cabinet (Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet).
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the Cabinet, by regulation, may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to require
approval by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the state
shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris or any other material,
or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building, barrier or
obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or stream or in
the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising or obstruction will in
any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the floodway of the
stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been submitted to and
approved by the Cabinet and a permit issued as required in division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Ch. 350 shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Ch. 151 concerning the regulation of dams,
levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills or other obstructions across or
along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Ch. 350 for surface coal mining operations.

constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM.
      (1)   A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.

met.
         (a)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
         (b)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or
state agency, an agency created by federal or state law or an agency of a
community participating in the NFIP.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to

AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD) 1988.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures and to minimize the costs of
disaster response and recovery.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW). Describes a condition where there is a river, flow
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall

levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD). (See BASE FLOOD.) The flood that
has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any
flood zone that begins with the letter “A” is subject to the 100-YEAR FLOOD.

§ 155.306 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this subchapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This subchapter does
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This subchapter
shall not create liability on the part of the Fiscal Court of the county, any
officer or employee, the commonwealth, the Federal Insurance Administration or
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this subchapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.3)
§ 155.307 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND NOTICE.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this subchapter including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and
any approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this subchapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms
and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved
modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain
Administrator shall issue a notice to the person responsible for the violation
and/or the property owner, stating the facts of the offense or violation, the
section of this subchapter and/or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how
the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into conformity with
this subchapter or with the approved permit, and within what period of time the
remedy is to occur, which period of time shall be reasonable and shall be
determined by the nature of the violation and whether or not it creates a
nuisance or hazard. The remedy may include an order to stop work on the
development. The notice shall also state that a citation may be forthcoming in
the event that the requested remedies and corrective actions are not taken,
which citation will request a civil monetary fine and shall state the maximum
fine which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation.
      (1)   If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or agent of the
Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a person has
caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and conditions
of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications thereof, a
duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a citation
to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation issued, how
the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into conformity with
this subchapter or with the approved permit, and within what period of time the
remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are recommended. When a
citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is issued shall respond to
the citation within seven days of the date the citation is issued by either
carrying out the remedies and corrections set forth in the citation, paying the
civil fine set forth in the citation or requesting a hearing before the
governing body.

of this subchapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance
with its provisions, and is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   (1)   The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed,
authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of
this subchapter. The Floodplain Administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this subchapter, which are consistent with its spirit and
purpose by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its
provisions.
      (2)   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
         (a)   Permit review. Review all development permits to ensure that:
            1.   Permit requirements of this subchapter have been satisfied;
            2.   All other required state and federal permits have been
obtained: advise the permittee that additional federal or state permits may be
required, and if specific federal or state permit requirements are known,
require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the
development permit;
            3.   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner; and
            4.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the
carrying capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this subchapter,
ADVERSELY AFFECTS means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
         (b)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
155.301 of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer §§
155.310 through
155.316 of this chapter. Any such information shall be submitted to the Fiscal
Court for adoption.
         (c)   Notification of other agencies.
            1.   Notify adjacent communities, the state’s Division of Water and
any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse;
            2.   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and
            3.   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
            1.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
155.317(C)(2) of this chapter;
            2.   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
155.301 of this chapter, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonable utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available
from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of
§§
155.310 through
155.316 of this chapter;
            3.   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure,
the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered

cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any
condition or ordinance violation which makes such building, structure or
premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Administrator may enter such
building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or
perform any duty imposed upon the administrator by this subchapter.
            2.   If such structure or premises are occupied, he or she shall
first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure
or premises are unoccupied, he or she shall first make a reasonable effort to
locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such request
entry.
            3.   If entry is refused, the Administrator shall have recourse to
every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
            4.   When the Administrator shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or
occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building,
structure or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the Administrator for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this subchapter, per and as
penalties by law.
         (g)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the Administrator, work on
any building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the
provisions of this subchapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in
writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her
agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under
which work may be resumed.
         (h)   Revocation of permits.
            1.   The Administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued
under the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based.
            2.   The Administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by
the Administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this subchapter.
         (i)   Liability. Any officer, employee or member of the Floodplain
Administrator’s staff, charged with the enforcement of this subchapter, acting
for the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties,
shall not thereby render himself or herself personally liable, and is hereby
relieved from all personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons
or property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of
his or her duties. Any suit brought against any officer, employee or member
because of such act performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision
of this subchapter shall be defended by the Department of Law until the final
termination of the proceedings.
         (j)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A floodplain
construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced construction
within 180 calendar days from the date of its issuance by the Floodplain
Administrator.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.4)
§ 155.309 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (A)   General. A development permit shall be obtained before any
construction or other development begins within any special flood hazard area
established in §
155.301 of this chapter. Application for a development permit shall be made on
forms furnished by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development
activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in
duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing.
Endorsement of local Administrator is required before a state floodplain
construction permit can be processed. Specifically, the following information
is required.
   (B)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade;
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§
155.311(B) and
155.313(B) of this chapter; and
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (C)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood-proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH and A
Zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood-
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.4)
§ 155.310 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
   (B)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use
of over-the-top or fame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
   (D)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition equipment
and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
   (F)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (G)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
   (H)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
   (I)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (J)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure,
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet the
requirements of “new construction”, as contained in this chapter.
   (K)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure,
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, shall be
undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.5)
§ 155.311 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
155.301 of this chapter, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction.
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, mechanical equipment and ductwork elevated no lower than two feet
above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used
to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of
division (C) below.
         (a)   In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified.
         (b)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Subsection 401, states as a part
of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: the applicant
shall provide cross-sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby
base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are
not available. All cross-sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and
shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than plus five-tenths (+0.5)
foot. Cross-section elevations shall be taken at those points which represent
significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of
the base floodplain change. Each cross-section shall extend across the entire
base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by
the Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not
occur, the Cabinet may require additional cross-sections or specific site
elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory
floodway boundary calculations.
         (c)   In all other zones, elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor, including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the Community Building Inspection
Department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) above or together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be flood-proofed below an elevation two feet above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is water-tight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and
ductwork, elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood
elevation;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
155.309(A)(3) of this chapter;
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) below;
and
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation two feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood water. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin
1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices; provided that, they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood water.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices; provided, they permit the automatic flow of flood waters
in both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction, including
elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
         (a)   On individual lots or parcels;
         (b)   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (c)   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
         (d)   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (e)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
         (f)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood.
      (2)   All manufactured homes must be:
         (a)   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
         (b)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than two feet above the
level of the base flood elevation; and
         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (3)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (4)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
subchapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured
homes”.
         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the state motor vehicle regulations, is
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
155.301 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply: prohibit encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless
certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood
discharge. If this division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
   (F)   Standards for utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
         (a)   Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
         (b)   Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
      (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them, or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.5)
§ 155.312 STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (UNNUMBERED A ZONES)
AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
155.301 of this chapter where streams exist, but where no base flood data has
been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the
following provisions apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
155.301 of this chapter.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.5)
§ 155.313 SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
155.301 of this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding areas.
   (B)   (1)   These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths
of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the
water path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate.
      (2)   Therefore, the following provisions apply.
         (a)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or, in Zone AO, the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
         (b)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall:
            1.   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or

on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade; and
            2.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely flood-proofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth, plus a minimum of one foot so
that any space below that level is water-tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
155.311(B) of this chapter.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.5)
§ 155.314 SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available
(Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is
the lesser, shall be provided.
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood
elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.5)
§ 155.315 ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE LETTER “A”.
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated “A”,
the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Structure must be non-habitable;
   (B)   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;
   (C)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one foot above grade,
total openings are to be one square inch per one square foot of floor area, at
least two openings required on opposite walls;
   (D)   Built of flood-resistant materials below a level two feet above the
base flood elevation;
   (E)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;
   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking; and
   (G)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.5)
§ 155.316 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of the base flood
elevation at the site. Flood-proofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into flood
waters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 8.5)
§ 155.317 APPEAL AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this subchapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the Fiscal Court to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this subchapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The Fiscal Court of the
county hereby establishes a Flood Damage Prevention Appeal Board (FDP Appeal
Board) consisting of the five county appointed Planning Commission members. The
member with the most time served as a Planning Commission member shall be the
designated Chairperson of the FDP Appeal Board.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this subchapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this subchapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local District Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this subchapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this subchapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this subchapter. For example, in the case of variances
to an elevation requirement, this means the Fiscal Court need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Fiscal Court
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances (as defined in § 155.299 of this
chapter under PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use; provided that, the provisions of divisions (E)(1)
through (E)(5) above are satisfied and that the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a
public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
and
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 155.330 REQUIRED PARKING IN VARIOUS ZONING DISTRICTS.
   In all districts, there shall be provided adequate off-street parking areas
in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter whenever there is an
addition or enlargement of an existing building, change of use or number of
employees or increase in floor area or development of any new structure.
   (A)   In all zones, parking for any residential structure, single dwelling
or multiple dwelling shall be provided in accordance with requirements in these
tables on the same site as the residential structure.
   (B)   (1)   Parking for any business shall be in a Commercial (C) Zoning
District; parking for any industrial use shall be in an Industrial (I)
District. No industrial or commercial parking may be permitted in any
residential district.
      (2)   All required parking shall be provided on the same site as the
principal use or within 200 feet of such site.

Special Notes for Calculation of Parking Spaces Provided
1.   For facilities with fuel fill up stations, the number of cars able to be
parked at the fill up stations shall count towards the number of spaces provided
or any pump service area that accommodates a 22-foot in length parking stall will
count toward the required parking spaces. However, a minimum of 1 handicap parking
space meeting ADA requirements shall be provided on site.
2.   Parking facilities may reduce the total minimum parking space requirement by
1 parking space for every 1 bicycle space provided on a permanently constructed
bicycle rack. The maximum reduction of required parking spaces shall be 5% of the
otherwise required amount.
3.   The required parking listed for auto sales facilities is meant to be separate
from the proposed area(s) for sales/ display area.
4.   In order to qualify for the shopping center parking requirements, shopping
centers shall contain a minimum of 3 tenants within the same building. When
restaurant uses contain 50% or more floor area within a building, the parking
calculation shall be based on restaurant use rather than shopping center for that
space. Free-standing buildings or out lots within a shopping center development
shall provide parking based on individual uses.
 
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 10.02)
§ 155.332 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Any area once designated as requiring off-street parking shall not be
changed to any other use unless and until equal facilities are provided
elsewhere.
   (B)   Two or more buildings or uses may collectively provide the required
off-street parking in which case the required number of parking spaces shall be
not less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses
computed separately.
   (C)   Every company car, truck, tractor and trailer normally stored at a
business site shall be provided with off-street parking space in an area
reserved for the use as determined by the Planning Commission. Such space shall
not be counted as meeting parking requirements.
   (D)   In cases of dual functioning off-street parking, where operating hours
do not overlap, the Board of Zoning Adjustments may waive the total parking
required; provided, said parking is sufficient to meet the requirements of the
greatest demand or largest combined demands.
   (E)   Such parking spaces as required in this subchapter shall not be
counted as meeting off-street loading requirements of this subchapter.
   (F)   New development should be encouraged to place the parking facilities
behind buildings in order to place focal emphasis on the uses themselves rather
than the parking areas.
(Ord. 8, passed 10-23-1987, § 10.03)
§ 155.333 OFF-STREET PARKING, FACILITY DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Whenever the required off-street parking requires the building of a parking
lot, and wherever a parking lot is built, such parking lot shall be laid out,
constructed and maintained in accordance with the following regulations.
   (A)   Back-out parking prohibited. Except for parcels of land devoted to
one- and two-dwelling uses, all areas devoted to off-street parking shall be so
designed and be of such size that no vehicle is required to back into a public
street to obtain egress.
   (B)   Parking rows.
      (1)   Continuous parking rows shall not exceed 17 parking spaces, unless
separated by landscaped islands with a minimum width and depth equal to a
parking space.
      (2)   Every parking row end shall provide a landscaped island not less in
size of a standard parking space.
   (C)   Connections between lots.
      (1)   (a)   Where practical neighboring parking facilities on different
parcels shall be connected to eliminate the necessity of utilizing the public
right-of-way for cross-movements between the uses.
         (b)   This practice also helps to reduce the number of necessary
driveways which reduces the number of pedestrian/vehicle conflict points.
      (2)   In those cases where a previously developed site later agrees to
add a connection point, the use(s) on the subject site shall not be penalized
for spaces lost in order to accommodate the connection.

         (b)   In cases where an off-street parking facility is required for a
commercial use listed as a permitted or conditional use in the AG Zone and is
occurring on property zoned AG, a non-paved surface construction may be
allowed.
         (c)   The parking lot shall be drained to eliminate surface water.
   (G)   Pedestrian safety and circulation. In any parking facility where more
than one aisle of parking stalls is to be provided, a pedestrian system should
be provided which separates pedestrian movement from vehicular circulation. The
pedestrian system shall provide access through the parking facility from the
main entrance of the building on site to the adjacent right-of-way, any
adjacent pedestrian facility that may exist (i.e., trails or other sidewalks
not immediately adjacent to vehicle right-of-way) or to the nearest public
transit shelter or pick-up location.
   (H)   Drive through drive aisle design. All drive aisles constructed to
access a drive-through facility shall be designed to eliminate any possibility
of interference with safe and efficient circulation on the development site or
abutting public right-of-way.

      (2)   Minimum dimensions. Each queue space shall be at least ten feet in
width and 20 feet in length.
   (I)   Landscaping. In order to achieve better traffic control, eliminate
glare, decrease excessive temperature, decrease runoff and alter the
impressions created by continuously paved surface, landscape areas shall be
provided within all parking lots. Such landscaping shall be in addition to
areas planned for setbacks or buffers.
      (1)   Interior landscape islands shall be required within all parking
facilities containing 6,000 or more square feet of area, or 20 or more parking

IMAGES/0-0-0-1339.png]
      (4)   Landscape islands shall be installed to provide landscape foliage
for a minimum of 15% of the parking area. Such islands may be equally spaced
within parking bays or grouped to provide more massive areas. Grouping may be
encouraged to save large existing trees which will require greater area for
root feeding and watering.
      (5)   Placement of landscape features shall not obstruct the vision of
driveways or pedestrians at critical locations (i.e., access points and
crosswalks).
      (6)   All parking facilities shall provide a landscape buffer when
abutting residentially used or zoned property. This landscape buffer shall
included a strip of evergreen trees at least six feet tall at time of planting
or a privacy fence.
      (7)   (a)   All parking facilities shall be screened, for the purpose of
minimizing views of parked cars from the public right-of-way, by a three-foot

§ 155.339 AUTO/EQUIPMENT SALES LOTS.
   The following standards shall apply to the development of outdoor sales lots
for the display/storage of automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, ATVs,
farm equipment, construction equipment or other substantially similar inventory
as interpreted by staff.
   (A)   Auto/equipment sales lots differ in use from typical off street
parking facilities. These lots serve as outdoor display areas of merchandise.
Unlike typical off street parking facilities, auto/equipment sales lots are not
required to be permanently striped so that retailers may arrange their
merchandise on the sales lot as they choose.
   (B)   All auto/equipment sales lots shall provide a landscape buffer along
the edge of the sales lot and/or property line whenever the property abuts
residentially zoned property. This landscape buffer shall include a strip of
evergreen trees or a privacy fence.
   (C)   Auto/equipment sales lots that utilize permeable paving options may be
exempted from the interior landscape island requirements elsewhere in this
chapter. Auto/equipment sales lots that do not utilize permeable paving options
shall comply with paving surface requirements listed elsewhere in this chapter.
   (D)   Auto/equipment sales lots shall comply with screening requirements
described in §
155.333 of this chapter.
   (E)   Auto/equipment sales lots built in compliance with this section must
be separate from the required off-street parking facilities on site and marked
clearly to define their area in contrast to the required off-street parking
facilities. Where auto/equipment sales lots are not clearly defined as separate
areas, the lots shall conform to all off-street parking regulations elsewhere
in this regulation.

more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign
faces visible from any one point.
   (C)   Computation of height.
      (1)   The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component
of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of:
         (a)   Existing grade prior to construction; or
         (b)   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the
sign.
      (2)   In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined,
sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the
normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to elevation of the nearest point
of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal
entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower. When a sign
is within the building setback, the calculation for the sign may use either the
base elevation or the elevation of the roadway.

§ 155.404 LOCATION AND DESIGN REGULATIONS.
   A new small cell system is subject to design review and approval by staff.
The design criteria required for the new small cell systems is determined by
the type of location or zoning district in which the facility is to be located.
The design review and approval process, including any public hearing, shall be
compliant with commonwealth and federal law, including applicable FCC cell
siting application shot clock approval timelines.
   (A)   Non-tower small cell system locations. A utility planning to locate an
antenna or related equipment on existing telecommunications structures, water
towers, buildings, utility poles (as defined by this regulation) or other
existing structures shall file with the planning office its intent to do so,
including the name and address of the utility, name of the owner of the
structure, the latitude and longitude of the structure, and a description of
the plan to locate the antenna or related equipment including a statement
documenting that the new antenna or related equipment location does not change
the height of the structure beyond the lower of 10 feet, or a 10% increase in
height over the original height of the structure. These non-tower locations
must adhere to all other applicable federal, state, and local zoning codes,
building codes or permits.
   (B)   New small cell system and small cell tower locations. The regulations
in this division apply to all new small cell system and small cell towers.
      (1)   Except when deployed in response to temporary service outages, as a
result of emergencies, or at the request of first responders, temporary, mobile
or wheeled cellular antenna towers shall not be permitted.
      (2)   New small cell towers shall not exceed the maximum building height
for the zoning district (or adjacent zoning district if in right-of-way) within
which they are located or 35-feet whichever is greater. A height that is in
excess of what is permitted within the zoning district may be approved by staff
if it integrates stealth technology that better meets the objectives of these
regulations.
      (3)   New small cell towers shall be designed and constructed to
accommodate a minimum of two service providers.
      (4)   New small cell towers may be located on public or private
nonresidential land or within a public right-of-way provided it does not
interfere with other utilities, functionality of sidewalks, visibility, or
other matters of public safety.
      (5)   New small cell towers shall not be illuminated, except in accord
with state or federal regulations, or unless illumination is integral to the
stealth technology, such as a design intended to look like a streetlight pole.
      (6)   New small cell towers shall not include advertisements and may only
display information required by a federal, state, or local agency. Such display
shall not exceed one square foot in area, unless required by state or federal
regulations, or unless a larger display is integral to the stealth technology.
Such display shall not exceed the width of the pole, unless required by state
or federal regulations or a wider sign is integral to the stealth technology,
such as a design which integrates a decorative banner.
      (7)   If a new small cell tower is located in an area with primarily
underground utilities, or where no adjacent overhead utility lines exist, it
shall not utilize overhead utility lines.
      (8)   In instances where an antenna is proposed to be constructed within
a historic or commercial district with established public or private design
control measures, regulations in division (C) of this section, shall be
followed. Efforts shall be made to adhere to any established design control
measures or existing furnishing or fixture styles within the district. Where
additional local design review processes exist, such as certificates of
appropriateness, such approvals may be required.
   (C)   New small cell systems and small cell towers locations in residential
zones. The regulations in this division apply to small cell systems small cell
towers to be located within, or immediately adjacent to, residential zoning
districts as defined in division (A) of this section.
      (1)   Facilities in residential areas are strongly encouraged to be non-
tower wireless communication facilities, which are exempt from these
regulations per division (A) of this section.
      (2)   New small cell towers and antenna or related equipment shall be
camouflaged by stealth technology. Examples of appropriate stealth technology
for residential areas includes, at a minimum, towers with all cables, wires,
transmission equipment, electric meters, power equipment, etc. installed inside
the small cell tower. Other types of stealth technology or other methods which
will reduce the visual impact may be approved by staff.
      (3)   All poles and antennas shall be uniform grey or black in color,
unless another color is integral to the stealth technology as approved by
staff.
      (4)   The use of cooling fans is discouraged. When needed, fans with
lower noise profiles must be used.
      (5)   New small cell towers should avoid areas without overhead
utilities. If a small cell tower is located in an area with primarily
underground utilities it must adhere to stealth technology that incorporates
the telecommunications equipment into a streetscape amenity such as a
decorative lamp post, streetlight or other approved design. In areas with
overhead utilities, cylindrical antennas are required.
      (6)   In residential areas, a small cell tower shall not be located
closer than the height of the proposed tower to an existing or proposed
residential structure, or no closer than 30 feet, whichever is greater.
      (7)   Efforts should be made to locate new small cell towers in the yard
location where other overhead utilities are located in the event that co-
location has been demonstrated to be infeasible.
      (8)   New small cell towers within residential areas should be located to
avoid obstructing the view of building facades by placing the tower at a
corner, intersection or along a lot line.
      (9)   New small cell tower shall not be located within 500 feet of an
existing small cell system tower. Multiple carriers are permitted and
encouraged to locate on one tower, where possible.
   (D)   New small cell system and small cell tower locations in non-
residential zones. The regulations in this division apply to towers to be
located within non-residential zoning districts.
      (1)   In instances where a facility is proposed to be constructed in the
right of way within 100 feet of a residential zone or use, even if the
antenna's physical location is within a non-residential zone, regulations in
division (C), shall be followed.
      (2)   Antennas in commercial, institutional, or park areas are encouraged
to be installed as non-tower wireless communication facilities.
      (3)   Reasonable effort shall be given to locate new equipment based upon
the following hierarchy of zones and land uses from the most to least
preferred:
         (a)   Co-locate on an existing structure whenever possible.
         (b)   Institutional.
         (c)   Industrial.
         (d)   Commercial.
         (e)   Public parks.
         (f)   Agricultural.
      (4)   Equipment enclosures, including electric meters, should be nearly
the same width as the pole or as small as possible. Ground mounted equipment
boxes should be screened from view with shrubs or other appropriate screening
as approved by staff.
      (5)   Shrouds, risers, and conduits shall be used to reduce the
appearance of external cabling.
      (6)   All poles, antennas, brackets, cabling, risers, shrouds, and
conduits shall be uniform grey or black in color, or other color as approved by
staff.
      (7)   Cylindrical antennas shall be required, unless another antenna
style is integral to the stealth technology as approved by staff.
      (8)   There shall be no more than a four inch offset between the pole and
pole mounted equipment enclosures.
