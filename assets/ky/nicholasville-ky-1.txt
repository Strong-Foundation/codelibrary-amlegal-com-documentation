   (c)   Independent representation. The city may provide for the defense of
any officer or employee through its own legal counsel or by employing
independent legal counsel or by purchasing insurance which requires the insurer
to defend. If the city defends through its own legal counsel and its legal

representation or shall provide independent representation. An employee may
have his own legal counsel to assist in the defense at the expense of the
employee.
   (d)   Notice of claim; request for defense. Upon receiving service of a
summons and complaint in any action or tort brought against him, an officer or

mayor.
   (e)   Refusal to provide defense; conditions. The city may refuse to provide

corruption; or
      (3)   A timely request to defend was not made in accordance with §
2-419(d) of this section.

refuses to provide an officer or employee with a defense and the officer or
employee provides his own defense, the officer or employee shall be entitled to
recover all necessary and reasonable costs of said defense from the city if the
act or omission is judicially determined to have arisen out of the actual or
apparent scope of the employee's employment and the employee is found to have
acted without fraud, malice or corruption.
   (g)   Payment of judgment. Subject to the limitations set forth in §
2-419(h) and (i) below and provided that the city shall not pay any award of
punitive or exemplary damages, the city shall pay any judgment rendered against

who is being provided a defense in an action in tort by the city shall not
enter into any compromise or settlement of the action without the approval of
the legislative body of the city.
   (j)   Scope of defense. Nothing in the section shall be construed as a
waiver of any defense which the city may assert in any action in tort brought
against it of any officer or employee of the city. Defense by the city of any
action shall not be deemed an admission by the city that the acts or omissions
of the officer or employee which gave rise to the action in tort were within
the actual or apparent scope of the officer or employee's employment or public
duties with the city.

Sec. 2-621. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND PUBLIC POLICY.
   (a)   The city commission finds that buildings and neighborhoods having

of vital importance in maintaining the economy of the city and that its

residential and business districts and that the history of the city is shown
today through buildings representing the activities and events during its
growth. The commission finds that the city has buildings and areas that
represent the persons who live and work or have lived and worked in
Nicholasville during a period of more than one hundred years. It is the finding

architectural and cultural heritage and by preventing unnecessary injury or
destruction of its landmarks and historic districts which are civic and
community assets.

Local Government program creating a new federal-state-local partnership to
encourage the efforts by cities to protect and preserve their landmarks and
historic districts.

Nicholasville and all the owners of property.
   (g)   The city commission declares as a matter of public policy that the
preservation, protection and use of landmarks and historic districts is a

architectural or cultural interest and value and thus serve as visible
reminders of the history and heritage of this city, state and nation. The
commission declares as a matter of public policy that this ordinance is
required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety, welfare and
economic well being of the people.
   (h)   The purpose of this ordinance is to effect the goals as set forth in
the above findings and declarations of public policy and specifically, but not
exclusively, to:
      (1)    Accomplish the preservation, protection, and use of historic
districts, landmarks and landmark sites having a special character or special
historic, architectural or cultural interest and value to this city, state and
nation;
      (2)   Promote the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of
the people and safeguard the city's history and heritage as reflected in such
landmarks, sites and districts;
      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values in such districts and in the
city as a whole;
      (4)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable accomplishments of the
past;
      (5)   Strengthen the economy of the city;

record shall include a statement of the specific exception authorizing the
withholding of the record and a brief explanation of how the exception applies
to the record withheld. The response shall be issued by the official custodian

of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under the
provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request, the
agency will provide additional documentation.

reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the agency may institute proceedings within thirty
(30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit court. In
addition, if the attorney general disallows the request or if the city
continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney General's
opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in circuit
court, the city shall notify the attorney general of such action. (KRS 61.880,

   (h)   Anticipated surplus from municipal utility or other public service

present to taxpayers a simple and clear summary of the detailed estimates of
the budget.
(Code 1972, § 2-87)
§ 2-865. ADMINISTRATION OF BUDGET, FINANCIAL CONTROL.
   (a)   Approval of expenditures. The chief financial officer shall have
charge of the administration of the financial affairs of the city and to that
end shall supervise and be responsible for the disbursement of all monies and
have control over all expenditures to ensure that appropriations are not
exceeded. The chief financial officer shall exercise financial budgetary
control over each office, department and agency and shall cause separate
accounts to be kept for the items of appropriation contained in the budget,
each of which account shall show the amount of the appropriation, the amounts
paid therefrom, the unpaid obligations against it and the unencumbered balance.
The same classification and numbering system used in the budget and required by
§
2-864(i) shall be used. Unless the chief financial officer shall certify that
there is a sufficient unencumbered balance available, no appropriation shall be
encumbered and no expenditure shall be made.
   (b)   Work programs, allotments. Before the beginning of the budget year,
the head of each office, department or agency shall submit to the budget
officer, at the time required by him, a work program for the year, which
program shall show the requested allotments of the appropriations for such
office, department or agency, by quarterly periods, for the entire budget year.
The budget officer shall review the requested allotments in the light of the
work program of the office, department or agency concerned and may revise,
alter or change such allotments before approving the same. The aggregate of
such allotments shall not exceed the total appropriation available to said
office, department or agency for the budget year. The budget officer shall
certify a copy of the allotments approved to the chief financial officer who
shall authorize all expenditures for the offices, departments and agencies to
be made from the appropriations on the basis of approved allotments and not
otherwise. The approved allotment may be revised during the budget year in the
same manner as the original allotment was made. If, at any time during the
budget year the budget officer shall ascertain that the available income, plus
balances, for the year will be less than the total appropriations, he shall
reconsider the work programs and allotments of the several offices, departments
and agencies and shall revise the allotments so as to forestall the making of
expenditures in excess of the income.
   (c)   Transfers of appropriations. The budget officer may at any time
transfer any unencumbered appropriation balance or portion thereof between
general classifications of expenditures within an office, department, or
agency. At the request of the budget officer, the city commission may by
resolution transfer any unencumbered appropriation balance or portion thereof
from one (1) office, department, or agency to another. No transfer shall be
made from the appropriations required by §
2-864.
   (d)   When contracts and expenditures prohibited. No office, department or
agency shall, during any budget year, expend or contract to expend any money or
incur any liability, or enter into any contract which by its terms involves the
expenditure of money for any purpose in excess of the amounts appropriated for
that general classification of expenditures pursuant to this article. Any
contract, verbal or written, made in violation of this article shall be null
and void.
   (e)   Appropriations lapse at end of year. All appropriations shall lapse at
the end of the budget year to the extent that they shall not have been expended
or lawfully encumbered.
(Code 1972, § 2-88)
§ 2-866. EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS.
   At any time in any budget, the city commission may, pursuant to this
section, make emergency appropriations to meet a pressing need for public
expenditure, for other than a regular or recurring requirement, to protect the
public health, safety or welfare. Such appropriation shall be by resolution
adopted by the favorable votes of at least a majority of the members of the
city commission and shall be made only upon recommendation of the budget
officer. The total amount of all emergency appropriations made in any budget
year shall not exceed the amount of unanticipated actual revenue in excess of
the budget estimates, plus transfers from other appropriations.
(Code 1972, § 2-89)
§ 2-867. REPORTS.
   The budget officer shall, within fifteen (15) days after the end of each
quarter, report to the city commission on the status of the various programs
authorized. The report shall include a tabular statement comparing the receipts
to date by source with the revenue estimate and a tabular statement indicating
for each appropriation the amount originally appropriated, the amount expended
or encumbered to date, and the available balance. Within forty-five (45) days
of the end of the fiscal year, sufficient copies of the final report shall be
made available for the use of all offices, departments and agencies, and for
the use of interested persons and civic organizations.
(Code 1972, § 2-90)
DIVISION 3. PROCUREMENT STANDARDS
§ 2-868. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   All procurements made by the City of Nicholasville that involve the
expenditure of Kentucky Community Development Block Grant Funds will be made in
accordance with the following procurement standards.
   (b)   Procurement transactions, regardless of method or dollar value, will
maximize open and free competition. The City of Nicholasville shall not engage
in procurement practices which may be considered restrictive in trade.
   (c)   Purchases will be reviewed by the community development director to
prevent duplication and to ensure that costs are reasonable.
(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)
§ 2-869. METHODS FOR PROCUREMENT.
   Procurement shall be made by one of the following methods: (a) small
purchase procedures, (b) competitive sealed bids, (c) competitive negotiation,
and (d) noncompetitive negotiation.
   (a)   Small purchases.
      (1)   Purchases of supplies, equipment and services which cost between
five hundred dollars ($500.00) and ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) will
require written estimates, however, no legal advertisement is required. The
city will solicit written responses from at least three (3) vendors, and if no
such responses are available, a statement explaining the procurement will be
prepared and filed.
      (2)   Purchases which cost between fifty dollars ($50.00) and five
hundred dollars ($500.00) require three (3) over-the-telephone quotations of
rate, price, etc. A memorandum will be prepared setting forth the date the
calls were made, parties contacted and prices obtained. For purchases of less
than fifty dollars ($50.00), efforts will be made to get the lowest and best
price, but written records of such efforts are not necessary.
   (b)   Competitive sealed bids. Bidding will be employed when detailed
specifications for the goods or services to be procured can be prepared, and
the primary basis for award is cost. When the cost of a contract, lease or
other agreement for materials, supplies, equipment or contractual services
other than those personal or professional, exceeds ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00), an invitation for bids (IFB) notice will generally be prepared.
This notice will be published at least once in at least one (1) official
newspaper of general circulation within the community. This newspaper notice
will appear not less than seven (7) days and not more than twenty-one (21) days
before the due date for bid proposals. The city may also solicit sealed bids
from responsible prospective suppliers by sending them a copy of such notice.
      (1)   The IFB will include a general description of the goods or services
to be procured, the bid deposit and bond performance required (if applicable),
the location where bid forms and specifications may be secured, the time and
place for opening bids, and whether the bid award will be made on the basis of
the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated price. If the lowest evaluated
price is used, the measurable criteria to be used must be stated in the IFB.
The newspaper notice must also contain language which calls to the attention of
bidders all applicable requirements (for example: Section 3 of the 1968 Housing
Act, Section 109 of the 1974 Housing and Community Development Act, the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11246 and the Davis-Bacon Act).
      (2)   Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place stated
in the IFB. The bids will be tabulated by the city at the time of bid opening.
The results of the tabulation and the bid documents will be examined for
accuracy and completeness by the review committee which will make
recommendations to the city council. In addition, the committee determines that
all firms are responsive and responsible. The Nicholasville city commission
will make the decision as to whom the contract shall be awarded. After the bid
award is made by the city, a contract will be prepared for execution by the
successful bidder. After the contract is signed, all bid deposits will be
returned to all unsuccessful bidders.
      (3)   The City of Nicholasville may cancel an IFB or reject all bids if
it is determined, in writing, that it is in the best interests of the city. The
city may allow a vendor to withdraw a bid if requested at any time prior to the
bid opening. Bids received after the time set for bid opening shall be returned
to the vendor unopened.
   (c)   Competitive negotiations.
      (1)   The city will use competitive negotiations, regardless of contract
amount, upon a written determination that:
         a.   Specifications cannot be made specific enough to permit the award
of a bid on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated
bid price, in other words, bidding is not feasible.
         b.   The services to be procured are professional or personal in
nature.
      (2)   With the exception of procurement of certain professional services,
principally engineering services, competitive negotiations will proceed as
follows:
         a.   Proposals will be solicited through newspaper advertisement;
additionally, a request for proposal (RFP) may be prepared and mailed to
qualified vendors. The newspaper advertisement must be published at least seven
(7) days and not more than twenty-one (21) days before the date for receipt of
the proposals. The RFP will describe services needed and identify the factors
to be considered in the evaluation of proposals and the relative weights
assigned to each selection factor. The RFP will also state where further
details regarding the RFP may be obtained. The RFP will call attention to the
same regulations discussed in the bidding process. The RFP will always include
cost as a selection factor.
         b.   Award must be made to the offerer whose proposal is determined in
writing by a review committee to be the most advantageous to the city.
Evaluations must be based on the factors set forth in the RFP and a written
evaluation of each response prepared. The review committee may contact the
firms regarding their proposals for the purpose of clarification and record in
writing the nature of the clarification. If it is determined that no acceptable
proposal has been submitted, all proposals may be rejected. New proposals may
be solicited on the same or revised terms or the procurement may be abandoned.
         c.   For the procurement of certain professional services, an
alternative to RFPs may be used.
      (3)   The city may publish a request for qualifications (RFQ). RFQs are
handled in a similar method to RFPs with the exception that cost is not a
factor in the initial evaluation. A review committee will evaluate the
responses and rank them by at least three (3) comparative qualifications. The
highest scoring person or firm will be contacted and the selection committee
will negotiate cost. If the committee is unable to negotiate a satisfactory
cost arrangement, the second-highest scoring person or firm will be invited to
negotiate. The committee will maintain a written record of all such
negotiations.
   (d)   Noncompetitive negotiations.
      (1)   Noncompetitive negotiations may be used for procurements in excess
of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) when bidding or competitive negotiations
are not feasible. The City of Nicholasville may purchase goods and services
through noncompetitive negotiations when it is determined, in writing by the
city, that competitive negotiation or bidding is not feasible and that:
         a.   An emergency exists that will cause public harm as a result of
the delay caused by following competitive purchasing procedures;
         b.   The product or service can be obtained only from one source;
         c.   The contract is for the purchase of perishable items purchased on
a weekly or more frequent basis;
         d.   Only one (1) satisfactory proposal is received through RFP or
RFQ; or
         e.   The state has authorized the particular type of noncompetitive
negotiation (for example – the procurement of services by an Area Development
District).
      (2)   Procurement by noncompetitive negotiation requires that
impartiality towards all suppliers be strictly observed. The DLG office of
community development must approve all procurement by noncompetitive
negotiation when only one supplier is involved or only one bid or response to
an RFP/RFQ is received.
(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)
§ 2-870. CONTRACTS.
   Generally, all procurement in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00) will
be memorialized and supported by a written contract. Where it is not feasible
or impractical to prepare a contract, a written finding to this effect will be
prepared, and some form of documentation regarding the transaction will be
prepared. The contractual provisions required by the “Common Rule”, 24 CFR Part
85 (Part 84 for Nonprofits) will be included in all contracts.
(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)
§ 2-871. DOCUMENTATION.
   All source documents supporting any given transaction (receipts, purchase
orders, invoices, RFP/RFQ data, and bid materials) will be retained and filed
in an appropriate manner. Where feasible, source documents pertinent to each
individual procurement shall be filed separately and maintained. Where it is
not feasible to maintain individual procurement files, source documents will be
filed and maintained in a reasonable manner (examples include: chronologically,
by vendor, by type of procurement, etc.). Whatever form of documentation and
filing is employed, the purpose of this section is to ensure that a clear and
consistent audit trail is established. At a minimum, source document data must
be sufficient to establish the basis for selection, basis for cost (including
the issue of reasonableness of cost) and basis for payment.
(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)
§ 2-872. LOCALLY-OWNED, MINORITY-OWNED, WOMEN-OWNED AND SMALL BUSINESSES.
   Efforts will be made and documented to solicit participation of locally-
owned, women-owned and small businesses. Where feasible, evaluation criteria
will include a factor with an appropriate weight for these firms. A list of
locally-owned, minority-owned, women-owned and minority-owned small businesses
located within the trade region shall be maintained and utilized when issuing
IFBs, RFPs and RFQs. This list shall also be consulted when making small
purchases.
(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)
§ 2-873. CODE OF CONDUCT.
   (a)   Conflict of interest. No elected official, employee or designated
agent of the city will take part or have an interest in the award of any
procurement transaction if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, exists. A
conflict of interest occurs when the official, employee or designated agent of
the city, partners of such individuals, immediate family member, or an
organization which employs or intends to employ any of the above has a
financial or other interest in any of the competing firms.
   (b)   Acceptance of gratuities. No elected official, employee or designated
agent of the city shall solicit or accept gratuities, favors or anything of
monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, subcontractors or
potential subcontractors.
   (c)   Penalties.
      (1)   Any elected official, employee or designated agent of the city who
knowingly and deliberately violates the provisions of this code will be open to
civil suit. Such a violation of these procurement standards is grounds for
dismissal by the city.
      (2)   Any contractor or potential contractor who knowingly and
deliberately violates the provisions of these procurement standards will be
barred from future transactions with the city.

management. Persons or firms requesting such a permit may be required to
furnish satisfactory authorization and evidence of their ability to properly
perform the proposed work.

cemetery including the unsolicited approaching of the bereaved. There shall be
no advertising of any description within the cemetery.

cemetery for any actions he/she has committed, which causes damage to the
cemetery grounds, planting, memorials or roadways.
   (b)   Approved materials.

memorials. Memorials for temporary or permanent use made of wood, concrete,
artificial stone, composition, tin, iron or plastics are not permitted.
      (2)   Bronze is approved for doors, windows, window grilles and other
fixtures for mausoleums. Bronze is approved for statuary and tablets that are
attached to memorials. The bronze must be cast from an alloy containing not
less that 85% copper and no more that 5% lead. Suppliers of bronze are required
to certify its analysis. The use of other metals may be approved if they are
non-corrosive and are of proven permanency.
      (3)   Monuments can be no larger than the following:
         Type of grave         Monument size
         Baby grave            no more than 1.5 feet
         Single grave            no more than 3 feet
         Lot               no more than 6 feet
   (c)   Artglass windows and panels.
      (1)   All must be framed in a bronze frame, which is lacquered to prevent
oxidation of the bronze.
      (2)   All glass pieces must be adjoined with a non-corrosive material
such as lead.
      (3)   All units must be attached to the stone in the following manner:
         A.   Mausoleum: Use bronze stops, which are attached from the inside
with non-corrosive screws or bolts.
         B.    Monument: A channel must be cut in the adjoining stone. The
glass unit is placed into the channel and wedged into place using lead.
      (4)   All units must have a protective covering of laminated glass, which
is vacuum-sealed. This is to prevent condensation from forming on the inside.
      (5)   Each unit must have an endowment equal to 25% of the value of the
artglass unit or $1,500.00 whichever is greater. The income produced by this
endowment will be used for the maintenance and/or repair of the artglass. The
cemetery may at its discretion purchase an insurance policy to cover any damage
that may occur. The cost of said policy will be provided from the endowment
income.
      (6)   Any person placing an artglass feature on their lot must sign a
disclaimer relieving the cemetery from any liability resulting from damage to
said memorial.
      (7)   The management of the cemetery may refuse to accept any design that

approve all designs.
      (8)   The management of the cemetery may have removed any artglass that
has been damaged or has become unsightly and cannot be restored.
   (d)   Inscriptions. An inscription on the base of a memorial is not

(4) inches above the bottom of the base.
   (e)   Monuments and markers.
      (1)   Only one (1) central memorial can be placed on any family lot. The
cemetery management determines the location of all memorials.
      (2)   Depending upon the location of the lot in the cemetery markers
shall range from flush markers to a height not to exceed one (1) foot above the
grade of the lot. Any lot of less than six (6) graves in size must use flush
foot markers. Markers shall be of one (1) piece only. The minimum size of any
marker shall be two (2) feet in length and one (1) foot in width. Double flush
markers must be at least four (4) inches in thickness. Exceptions to these
sizes will be made in the instance of existing markers and of the duplication
of such markers on a family lot.
      (3)   Only one (1) marker is permitted per grave space. If more than one
interment is made in a grave space all the inscriptions must be placed on the
one marker.
      (4)   All flush markers must be delivered to the cemetery service area on
or before the 15th of the month in which its setting is to occur. This permits
the setting of the marker as soon as possible after the marker’s foundation has
been poured. This eliminates the possibility of someone being injured by
stepping into a flush marker foundation.
      (5)   The bottom surface of every base and marker shall be dressed to an
even level bed so that it will stand plumb. This allows the marker or base to
rest firmly and level on the foundation. All joints on memorials shall be
sealed against moisture with non-staining material.
      (6)   All open urns incorporated in the design of a memorial must have a
drain that extends down throughout the die and the base and must be lined with
copper. The foundation order must show the location and the size of the urn and
drain. Any urn not drained using this method must be permanently capped.
      (7)   All grave ledger stones must be set flush with the surface of the
glass, except where matching an existing ledger.
   (f)   Mausoleums and tombs.
      (1)   Mausoleums or tombs either wholly or partially above ground must be
constructed only on lots approved for that purpose. Mausoleums must be built of
material fulfilling the requirements prescribed for other memorials. All
mausoleums must be designed with air vents and have drains, which empty into
dry wells. The plans, specifications and location of any mausoleum are subject
to approval of the cemetery management.
      (2)   An endowment, created for the future care of all mausoleums, is
required. This must be paid to the Maple Grove Cemetery Trust before the
installation of the mausoleum in the cemetery. This endowment is to be made in
the amount of 10% of the sum price of the mausoleum, foundation and lot, the
minimum being $2,000.00.
   (g)   Miscellaneous.
      (1)   No lot owner shall install, place or cause to be installed on any
lots in the cemetery any memorial, which the cemetery management disapproves.
      (2)   Except upon written permission of the owner, photographing, making
details measurements and drawings of memorials for the purpose of duplication
is forbidden.
      (3)   While the cemetery and its personnel will exercise all possible
care to protect all monuments, markers and structures, as well as raised
lettering, carving and ornamentation, it disclaims responsibility for any
damage thereto. The cemetery disclaims any responsibility for any damage caused
to memorials by an "act of God" or vandalism. The cemetery may accept
responsibility when it is in management's judgement that a monument was damaged
due to personnel negligence.
      (4)   The board of commissioners reserves the right to exclude or remove
from any lot, any memorial or other structure which is determined by them to be
offensive, improper or injurious to the surrounding lots or grounds. The
cemetery management reserves the right to remove any memorial or structure that
has become dilapidated or unsightly.
      (5)   Cemetery management retains authority to reject any plan or design
for a memorial, which, in the opinion of the cemetery, because of size,
inscriptions, kind of quality of stone or material is unsuited to the lot,
where it is to be placed.
      (6)   Special care may arise in which the literal enforcement of a rule
may impose unnecessary hardship. The cemetery, therefore, reserves the right,
without notice, to make exceptions, suspensions or modifications in any of
these rules and regulations. Any such temporary exception, suspension or
modification shall in no way be construed as affecting the general application
of such rules.
      (7)   The cemetery may, and it hereby expressly reserves the right at any
time or times, to adopt new rules and regulations. It reserves the right to
amend, alter or repeal any rules, regulations, articles, sections, paragraphs
or sentence in these requirements.
      (8)   There shall be no burials in Maple Grove Cemetery on Sunday,
Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, Memorial Day, and New Year's Day.
      (9)   All opening and closing fees must be paid before opening.
      (10)   At least thirty-six (36) hours’ notice shall be given to the
caretaker of the cemetery before the opening and closing of the graves. Forty-
eight (48) hours are required on weekends.
      (11)   Burial permits must be provided before burial.
      (12)   Operation times of Maple Grove Cemetery are 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
      (13)   There shall be no burials in Maple Grove Cemetery by any person(s)
other than employees of the City of Nicholasville Maple Grove Cemetery. Any
person who is found violating graves shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor
for the first offense and a Class D felony for each subsequent offense. (KRS
525.115, Violating Graves)

markers in whole or in part. The term cemetery and Maple Grove Cemetery are

the officer or employee, a family member, an outside employer, or a business as
defined in division (c)(4) through (c)(7) of this section, as a member of any
business occupation, profession, or other group, to any greater extent than any
gain could reasonably be expected to accrue to any other member of the
business, occupation, profession, or other group.
   (e)   Every officer or employee who has a prohibited financial interest
which the officer or employee believes, or has reason to believe, may be

whole or in part, any contract made, entered into, awarded, or granted by the
city or a city agency, except as follows:
      (1)   The prohibition in division (a) of this section shall not apply to
contracts entered into before an elected officer filed as a candidate for city
office, before an appointed officer was appointed to a city or city agency
office, or before an employee was hired by the city or a city agency. However,
if any contract entered into by a city or city agency officer or employee
before he or she became a candidate, was appointed to office, or was hired as
an employee, is renewable after he or she becomes a candidate, assumes the
appointed office, or is hired as an employee, then the prohibition in division
(a) of this section shall apply to the renewal of the contract.
      (2)   The prohibition in division (a) of this section shall not apply if
the contract is awarded after public notice and competitive bidding, unless the
officer or employee is authorized to participate in establishing the contract
specifications, awarding the contract, or managing the contract performance
after the contract is awarded. If the officer or employee has any of the
authorities as set forth in the preceding sentence, then the officer or
employee shall have no interest in the contract, unless the requirements set
forth in division (a)(3) of this section are satisfied.
      (3)   The prohibition in division (a) of this section shall not apply in
any case where the following requirements are satisfied:
         a.   The specific nature of the contract transaction and the nature of
the officer's or employee's interest in the contract are publicly disclosed at
a meeting of the governing body of the city or city agency.
         b.   The disclosure is made a part of the official record of the
governing body of the city or city agency before the contract is executed.
         c.   A finding is made by the governing body of the city or city
agency that the contract with the officer or the employee is in the best
interests of the public and the city or city agency before the contract is
executed.
         d.   The finding is made a part of the official record of the
governing body of the city or city agency before the contract is executed.
   (b)   Any violation of this section shall constitute a Class A misdemeanor,
and upon conviction, the court may void any contract entered into in violation
of this section. Additionally, violation of this section shall be grounds for
removal from office or employment with the city in accordance with any
applicable provisions of state law and ordinances, rules or regulations of the
city.
(Ord. No. 087-2022, 7-25-22)
§ 2-1307. INCOMPATIBLE OFFICES.
   (a)   Pursuant to Section 165 of the Kentucky Constitution, no officer or
employee of the city may also be a state officer, deputy state officer or
member of the General Assembly or may fill more than one (1) municipal office
at the same time, whether in the same or a different city.
   (b)   Pursuant to KRS 61.080, no city officer may also hold a county office.
In addition, the statute also states that the following city and consolidated
local government offices are incompatible with any other public office:
      (1)   Member of the legislative body of cities of the first class;
      (2)   Mayor and member of the legislative council of a consolidated local
government; and
      (3)   Mayor and member of the legislative body in cities of the home rule
class.
   (c)   In addition to the Constitution and statutory provisions, there are
common law incompatibilities that have been defined by the courts. City
officers and employment positions are deemed incompatible when one (1) office
or position of employment is subordinated to the other, or when the functions
of the two (2) offices are inherently inconsistent or repugnant, or when the
occupancy of both offices is detrimental to the public interest.
   (d)   KRS 61.090 provides that the acceptance of an incompatible office
operates to vacate the first office.
(Ord. No. 087-2022, 7-25-22)
§ 2-1308. Withdrawal from participation.
   (a)   An officer or employee must refrain from acting on or discussing,
formally or informally, a matter before the city, if acting on the matter, or
failing to act on the matter, may personally or financially benefit any of the
persons or entities listed in Sec.

occurs at a public meeting or leave the room if it is a legally conducted
closed meeting (executive session) under KRS 61.810 and KRS 61.815.
   (b)   Withdrawal at a meeting requires the public announcement, on the
record, of the reason for withdrawal.
   (c)   Ongoing conflict. An officer or employee whose outside employment or
other outside activity or relationship can reasonably be expected to require
more than sporadic withdrawal must resign or cease such outside employment or
activity. An officer or employee should not begin employment or an activity or
relationship that can reasonably be expected to require more than sporadic
withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is in such a situation, he or
she should not accept the position with the city.

or promise, or any other form, under circumstances in which it could reasonably
be inferred that the gift was intended to influence, or could reasonably be
expected to influence the officer or employee in the performance of his or her
public duties.

not prevent an elected or appointed officer from voting on or participating in
the development of a budget which includes compensation for a family member,
provided that the family member is included only as a member of a class of
persons or a group, and the family member benefits to no greater extent than
any other similarly situated member of the class or group.
   (d)   The prohibitions in this section shall not apply to any relationship
or situation that would violate the prohibition, but which existed prior to
August 4, 2022.

   (b)   This section shall not preclude an officer or an employee from

Sec. 2-1323. Social media.
   (a)   City officials can maintain a personal presence on social media.
However, to be considered personal, there can be no mention of their status as
a city official. Any mention of their status as a city official potentially
changes the nature of the page to one for a public agency, requiring record
keeping in accordance with the Kentucky Department of Library and Archives
retention schedule and subjecting the entire page to open records request.
   (b)   Elected city officials who want to interact with the community on
social medias in their role as a city official are required to maintain a

Deleted comments shall be provided to the City Clerk and must be saved for one
(1) year.
   (f)   City officials shall not conduct city business through their social
media sites. If receiving a specific request from a citizen, the city official
shall state words to the effect of: "Thank you for your question. Please email
me at [official email address] or contact me at [phone number]. I look forward
to speaking with you."
   (g)   Elected officials shall not discuss issues pending before the
commission. Elected officials may seek public input but shall not respond to
comments. Engaging in substantive conversations on social media could require
retention of the posts and may violate the Open Meeting Act if other elected
officials are also engaging in the discussion.
   (h)   City employees are bound by the city's social media policies in the
City of Nicholasville Employee Handbook.
(Ord. No. 087-2022, 7-25-22)

Department of Library and Archives schedule for emails. City officials shall
direct any record keeping questions to the City Clerk.

   (b)   The Ethics Board may, on its own initiative, determine through an

Ethics Board may also consolidate complaints where the allegations are
materially related. Amended complaints must be sent to the complainant and

reduce the conclusion to writing, and transmit a copy of its decision to the
complainant and to all officers or employees against whom the complaint was
filed.

or affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, and require the
production of any books or records it deems relevant and material. The Police
Department and all city agencies, bodies, officials, and employees are required
to respond fully and truthfully to all inquiries and cooperate with all
requests of the Ethics Board or its agents relating to an investigation. It is

information requested by the Ethics Board in the course of an investigation or
a public hearing, except to the extent that such denial is required by federal,
state, or local law.
   (k)   Nothing in this section may be construed to permit the Ethics Board to

Sec. 3-13. Expiration of license; proration of fees.
   (a)   For licenses issued on or before January 1, 2017, all city licenses,
except temporary licenses, shall begin on July 1 of any year and shall expire
on June 30 of the following year. Any licenses issued after December 31 of any
year shall be assessed a fee which is based on the pro rata portion of the
remainder of the license period; however, the cost of any license shall not be
less than one-half (½) the amount of the full fee for an annual license of that
type.
   (b)   For licenses issued after January 1, 2017:
      (1)   All city licenses, except for those listed in divisions (b) and (c)
of this section shall be valid for a period of no more than a year and shall be
renewable upon the date established by the Kentucky Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control for the expiration of state licenses issued for the premises
located in the city. During the first year following July 15, 2016, if the new
date for renewal for the licenses does not occur on the date established by the
department for the expiration of the licensee’s state license, the city
administrator shall either:
         a.   Prorate the cost of the renewed license by proportionally
reducing the cost of the renewed license if the new date for the renewal occurs
prior to the expiration of the previous license; or
         b.   Provide a prorated provisional local license to cover any period
of time between the expiration of the previous license and the new date for
renewal if the new date for renewal occurs after the expiration of the
licensee’s previous license.
      (2)   Division (1) of this section shall not apply to special event
licenses, temporary licenses or licenses listed in division (3) of this
section.
      (3)   All alcoholic beverage producers, wholesalers, or distributor s
obtain or renew their licenses for licenses for either a one or a two year
term.
      (4)   When any person applies for a new license, he or she shall be
charged, if the license is issued, the full fee for the respective license if
six months or more remain before the license is due to be renewed and one-half
the fee if less than six months remain before the license is due to be renewed.
No abatement of license fees shall be permitted to any person who held a
license of the same kind for the same premises in the preceding license period
and who was actually doing business under the license during the last month of
the preceding license period.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13; Ord. No. 967-2016, passed 12-5-16)
Sec. 3-14. Payment of license fees; delinquency.
   No licensee shall enter into or begin operating any business for which a
license is required by this chapter until the license fee has been paid in
full. The fee for renewal of any license shall be paid with the renewal
application. Failure to pay any license fee within ten (10) days after it
becomes due shall result in a penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the license
fee. Any licensee failing to pay the fees, including penalties, within ten (10)
days after such fees are due may be subject to revocation of the license and to
other penalties as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-15. Refund of fees.
      (1)   Should any licensee under this chapter be prohibited from
conducting the licensed business for the full period covered by the license
because of any changes that may hereafter be made in the laws of the state with
reference to alcoholic beverages or other cause outside licensee's control,
then the city shall refund to licensee the proportionate part of the license
fee for the period during which licensee is prevented from carrying on said
business if the licensee provides sufficient proof to the city ABC
administrator that such period of inactivity was not the fault of the licensee
or the result of a revocation, suspension or other wrongdoing by licensee, or
an agent or employee of the licensee.
      (2)   In the event a violation of this chapter occurs that results in the
suspension or revocation of the license, the city shall not refund any portion
of the license fee.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-16. Regulatory license fee.
      (1)   Pursuant to KRS 243.075, there is hereby imposed a regulatory
license fee on the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of each
license issued by the city ABC administrator. As of the time of adoption of
this chapter, the regulatory license fee shall be five percent (5%) of gross
sales of all alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. In the case of retail sales
of package distilled spirits and wine, the regulatory license fee shall be five
percent (5%) of gross sales. The regulatory license fee shall be five percent
(5%) on gross retail sales of package malt beverages. Thereafter, the city
commission may adopt at the budget adoption for each subsequent fiscal year,
such annual rate for the regulatory license fee as shall be reasonably
estimated to ensure full reimbursement to the city for the cost of any
additional policing, regulatory, or administrative expense related to the sale
of alcoholic beverages in the city. Should the city fail to address the
regulatory license fee in any budget, then the regulatory license fee shall
remain at the level at which it was last fixed until such time as the city
commission shall adjust the fee.
      (2)   Payment of said regulatory fee shall be remitted to the city ABC
administrator, who shall transmit all fees to the city clerk, or his or her
designee, for deposit into the appropriate designated account. The city may use
said fees as permitted by law, including but not limited to, any cost of
additional policing, regulatory or administrative expenses related to the sale
of alcoholic beverages in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in
addition to any other fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit
against a regulatory license fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount
equal to any license fee imposed by the city pursuant to the fees outlined
herein. Payment of the regulatory license fee shall be based on paperwork
required by the local and/or state ABC administrator, which may include but is
not limited to tax returns and financial statements. Said paperwork and payment
will be due according to the schedule set forth by the mayor, or his designee.
      (3)   Failure to pay such remittance within ten (10) days of the due date
constitutes a violation and subjects licensee to suspension or revocation.
      (4)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay remittance by the due
date is five percent (5%) of the regulatory fee for each ninety (90) days or
fraction thereof. The total late filing penalty shall not exceed twenty-five
percent (25%) of the regulatory fee; provided, however, that in no case shall
the penalty be less than ten dollars ($10.00).
      (5)   Any payment made after the first of the month shall bear interest
at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) for each month or fraction of a
month until paid.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13; Ord. No. 916-2015, 6-1-2015; Ord. No. 946-2016, 6-
27-16; Ord. No. 977-2017, 6-26-17)
Sec. 3-17. Disposition of fees and any other type of payment to the city.
   (1)   The city ABC administrator shall transmit all fees made to the city,
upon collection, to the city clerk, or his or her designee, for deposit into
the appropriate designated account.
   (2)   Any and all fines from violations to be paid to the city shall be used
for alcohol awareness education including, but not limited to the D.A.R.E.
Program.

the advertisement and proof of the publication as provided in KRS 424.170.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)

   (a)   All licenses granted under this chapter shall be approved by the city
ABC administrator. Applications for the issuance of new licenses and for
renewals of existing licenses shall be in writing and upon the forms provided
by the Kentucky ABC Board and/or the city, both of which may be amended and
supplemented from time to time by each respective agency.
   (b)   The application shall be verified and shall set forth in detail such
information concerning the applicant and the premises for which the license is
sought, as required by the Kentucky Revised Statutes, the state ABC Board, and
the city, including as follows:
      (1)   Name and address;
      (2)   Nature of interest;
      (3)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
      (4)   Date of birth;
      (5)   Date residence was established in the state, if a resident of the
state. If city resident, indicate when residence was established;
      (6)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license or
LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license
under this chapter;
      (7)   Extent of stock or company ownership;
      (8)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or LLC,
corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license in

   (c)   Each application shall be accompanied by a certified check, cashier
check, or money order for the amount of the license fee, less the fifty dollars
($50.00) application fee.
   (d)   In addition to the above specified information, the applicant shall
file, with the application, responses to any additional questions as may be
posed or prescribed by the city ABC administrator. The city commission has
adopted a statement of guidelines and priorities for the issuance of licenses
within this chapter to determine the extent to which applications may further,
or impede, the objectives of those guidelines. Therefore, in addition to the
information contained in the application, the city ABC administrator may
require such other information as the administrator may, in his or her
discretion, deem desirable, reasonable, or appropriate to the consideration of
the application.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-33. Other conditions.
   In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations required or
permitted by law:
   (a)   The city ABC administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage
license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his or her
place of business shall have been approved by the city building inspector, and
any and all other inspections required by the Kentucky Building Code or other
applicable law;
   (b)   All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal background check
and shall sign a waiver allowing the release of this information to the city
ABC administrator; and
   (c)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be granted or
renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any property taxes,
both real and personal, due to the city, fees of any type, or charges due to
any department of the city at the time of issuing the license, nor may any
license be transferred, granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or
property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any of the
above delinquent payments due and owing to the city. Further, if a licensee
becomes delinquent in the payment of any of the above at any time during the
license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be subject
to revocation or suspension.
   (d)   No person, whether an applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in
any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the city
ABC administrator, or any member the city's staff, or any state ABC
administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This division is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or state ABC
administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a
license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for
appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this
chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit monetary
settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order
or revocation or suspension, where the chapter and applicable statutes allow
for such payments in settlement.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13; Ord. No. 967-2016, passed 12-5-16)
Sec. 3-34. Form of license.
   All city licenses shall be in such form as may be provided by the ABC
administrator, but at the least per state law shall contain:
   (a)   The name and address of the licensee;
   (b)   The number of the license;
   (c)   The type of license;
   (d)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the licensed
premises;
   (e)   The name and address of the owner of the building in which the
licensed premises are located;
   (f)   The expiration date of the license;
   (g)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a property or
vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to law.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-35. Change of information.
   (a)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the city ABC administrator within ten (10) days of the change.
   (b)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the city ABC administrator. The
city ABC administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
      (1)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other
business organization herein, the word "change" is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the
corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than ten
percent (10%) of the total ownership or stock shall require a new license.
      (2)   The following information shall be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
         a.   Name and address;
         b.   Nature of interest;
         c.   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         d.   Date of birth;
         e.   Date residence was established in the state, if a resident of the
state. If a city resident, indicate when residence was established;
         f.   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license or
in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license under this act;
         g.   Extent of stock or company ownership;
         h.   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in
any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license in any other state or province.
      (3)   This information shall be filed with the city ABC administrator as
a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten (10) days of any change of required
information.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-36. Renewal of license.
   (a)   Every year, except in the case of temporary licenses, each licensee
shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the city ABC
administrator no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the
license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except
where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises
licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act
of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the
premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private
organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
existing lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less than twenty (20) days from the expiration date of the
license, setting forth these facts, and the city ABC administrator is hereby
authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a
reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the city ABC
administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from
the expiration date of the former license or licenses. Said license fee shall
not be payable until application is made for the transfer of said license to a
new location.
   (b)   The renewal by the city ABC administrator of the license shall not be
construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to
such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the licensee.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-37. Lost or destroyed license.
   When a license shall be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of the
licensee or his or her agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the original
license shall be issued by the city ABC administrator after the administrator
shall have been satisfied as to the facts; provided, however, that the
applicant for said duplicate license shall pay a fee of ten dollars ($10.00)
for the duplicate license.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-38. Revocation or suspension.
   (a)   Any license may be revoked or suspended by the city ABC administrator
if the licensee shall have violated any of the provisions of KRS Ch. 241
through 244, or any rule or regulation of the ABC Board, or of the Kentucky
Department of Revenue, relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale, and
transportation, or taxation, of alcoholic beverages or if such licensee shall
have violated or shall violate any act of Congress or any rule or regulation of
any federal board, agency or commission, or this chapter now, heretofore, or
hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale, and
transportation, or taxation, of intoxicating liquors, or any rules or
regulations of the city heretofore in existence or authorized by the terms of
KRS Ch. 241 through 244 to be created, irrespective of whether the licensee
knew of or permitted the violation or whether the violation was committed in
disobedience of his or her instructions, or any such license may be revoked or
suspended for any cause which the city ABC administrator in the exercise of his
or her sound discretion deems sufficient.
   (b)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the city ABC
administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had
been known.
   (c)   In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be revoked
or suspended for the following causes:
      (1)   Conviction of the licensee or his or her agent or employee for
selling any illegal beverages on the premises licensed.
      (2)   Making any false, material statements in an application for a
license.
      (3)   If within a period of two (2) consecutive years, any licensee or
any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the licensee shall have been convicted
of two (2) violations of the terms and provisions of KRS Ch. 241 through 244 or
any act heretofore or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the
manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages or if within such
period, any licensee or any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the licensee
shall have twice been convicted of any felony or of any misdemeanor directly or
indirectly attributable to the use of alcoholic beverages, or of one (1) such
felony and one (1) such misdemeanor.
      (4)   Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee to pay an
excise tax or any part thereof, or any penalties imposed by or under the
provisions of any statutes, this chapter, or acts of Congress relative to
taxation, or for a violation of any rules or regulations of the Kentucky
Department of Revenue made in pursuance thereof.
      (5)   Setting up, conducting, operating or keeping, on the licensed
premises, any gambling game, device, machine or contrivance, or lottery or gift
enterprise, or handbook or facility for betting or transmitting bets on horse
races; or permitting to be set up, conducted, operated, kept, or engaged in, on
the licensed premises, any such game, device, machine, contrivance, lottery,
gift enterprise, handbook or facility.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-39. Proceedings for revocation or suspension of license.
   (a)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any
law enforcement officer, or of the city ABC administrator, the city ABC
administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license
granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after
the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered
mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such
proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in
opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or
in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
   (b)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall be those set out in the Kentucky Administrative
Procedure Act (KAR Chapter 13B).
   (c)   A decision of the city ABC administrator revoking or suspending a
license may be appealed as provided in KRS 243.550.
   (d)   Within three (3) days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the city ABC administrator. If the revoked or
suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the chief of
police, at the request of the city ABC administrator, shall immediately cause
one of his or her officers to take physical possession of the license and
return it to the city ABC administrator.
   (e)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee may,
with prior approval of the city ABC administrator, dispose of and transfer his
or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
   (f)   Appeal from the decision of the city ABC administrator revoking or
suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing of an appeal
shall stay further proceedings for revocation.
   (g)   If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the city ABC
administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at once
suspend all operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the entry of a
final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on
appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under this
license.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-40. Transfer or assignment.
   No license issued under this chapter shall be transferred or assigned either
as to licensee or location except with prior approval of the city ABC
administrator and not then until a payment of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
shall be made to the city ABC administrator.
(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)
Sec. 3-41. Refusal of license; guidelines for approval of quota licenses.
   (a)   The city ABC administrator may refuse to issue or renew a license for
any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for suspension
or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for state
licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as violation of
any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or the
administration thereof.
      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of license
would be authorized under local, state, or federal law; or
      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
   (b)   In the case of any licenses subject to the state ABC Board set quota,
before approving an application, the city ABC administrator is directed to
consider, in addition to the factors set out in KRS 243.450, 243.490 and
243.500, and any other factors the administrator determines in his or her
discretion to be reasonable and pertinent to the license application, the
following criteria:
      (1)   Ownership. The city places great value on business owners who are
invested in the Nicholasville community.
      (2)   Economic impact. The city desires businesses which make the most
positive impact on the community, in number of jobs, payroll, property
investment and revenues to the city.
      (3)   Site of business. The city is interested in serving all geographic
areas of the city. Therefore, the city does not wish to cluster all licensed
ABC outlets in one area.
      (4)   Aesthetics. The city is committed to protecting the character and
beauty of our community.
      (5)   Revitalization of downtown. The city wholeheartedly supports the
revitalization of downtown and the revitalization and reuse of existing
buildings.
      (6)   Capital. The city values businesses that demonstrate their ability
to financially support and sustain their viability.
      (7)   Public support of licensed business in the area. The city intends
that public sentiment and safety be considered in deciding upon the approval of
retail liquor sales licenses in any area of the city.
      (8)   Long term growth of the city. The city intends to consider the long
term growth of the city and ensure that all growth is consistent with the

become null and void after ninety (90) days. Such is the intent of this
section. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her
business interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various
exceptions to the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
   (b)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of
ninety (90) days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth
in division (c) below are proved to the satisfaction of the city ABC

   (c)   The provisions of division (b) hereof shall not apply to any licensee
who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a license is
issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of
the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency under
power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or
loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the
expiration of ninety (90) days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to
the city ABC administrator a verified statement setting forth the fact that the
licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set
forth herein, and the city ABC administrator may grant an extension of the
dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect during the license
period or until same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the
fact that no business is transacted during said period; provided, however, no
such license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted thereunder
within twelve (12) months from the date of notice to the city ABC
administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the city ABC administrator deems appropriate in exercise of
his or her sound discretion.

§ 6A-101. RATE FILINGS BY OPERATOR REQUIRED.
   Within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the city as set out in §
6A-100, the operator shall file with the city a schedule of its current rates
for basic service and equipment and justification for them (the rate filing).
The operator may, if it so chooses, file a proposal with appropriate
justification for an increase as defined in §
6A-2, in its current rates. The operator may at any time thereafter submit a
proposal to increase its rates, consistent with FCC regulations.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-102. SUPPORT FOR RATE FILINGS; BURDEN OF PROOF.
   The rate filing submitted by the operator, either for its current rates or
for a change in its current rates, must show that the rates the operator
charges or proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable
and in compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations. The burden of
proof is on the operator to show that the rates are reasonable and in
compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations.
      (1)   If the operator asserts that its current rates or its proposed
rates are within the "benchmark" or "cap" as defined by the FCC, it must fully
complete applicable FCC forms and otherwise provide material to support its
position.
      (2)   If the operator proposes to increase its rates above that level
permitted by the FCC "benchmark" or "cap", it may seek to make a "cost-of-
service" showing in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the FCC.
In seeking to make a "cost-of-service" showing, the operator must fully
complete applicable FCC forms and otherwise provide material to supplement its
position.
      (3)   If the operator proposes to add or delete channels or service, or
to remove certain channels from the basic service to the cable programming
service tier as defined by the FCC or to a non-regulated status, it must
explain in writing the impact of the addition, deletion or removal on its basic
service rates and demonstrate why the addition, deletion or removal complies
with FCC rules and regulations.
      (4)   The operator must show why all rates for all customer
classifications are reasonable.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-103. APPROVAL OF CITY NECESSARY.
   Once an operator has been notified that the city has commenced regulation of
its rates, the operator may not thereafter increase its rates for basic service
or equipment without the prior approval of the city. This requirement applies
in all cases, including increases it has announced but not yet implemented
prior to the date it received notice of rate regulation from the city.
§ 6A-104. TIMING OF RATE FILING.
   Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for
review at least thirty (30) days in advance of the proposed effective date of
the increase.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-105. INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED.
   In addition to any information it provides in support of its current rates
or request for increase in rates, the operator shall provide all other
information requested by the city, subject to a request for confidentiality
pursuant to §
6A-111.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-106. SCHEDULE OF ACTION BY CITY; TOLLING PERIODS.
   After the operator has submitted a rate filing to justify its current rates
or to seek an increase, the current rates shall remain in effect subject to
further action by the city. If the city takes no action within thirty (30) days
of the submission to approve, disapprove, or toll the period of reviewing the
rates, the current rates or the proposed rates, as the case may be, shall be
deemed approved. The city may, however, toll the thirty (30) day period by
issuing a brief written municipal order explaining that it needs additional
time to request or review additional information or consider comments from
interested parties.
      (1)   For filings not involving cost-of-serve showings, the city may toll
the rates for an additional ninety (90) days after the expiration of the
initial thirty (30) days.
      (2)   For filings seeking a rate increase based upon a cost-of-service
showing, the city may toll the rates for an additional one hundred fifty (150)
days after the expiration of the initial thirty (30) days. If the city
commission so desires, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a cost-of-service
showing, it may ask the FCC pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.7 to examine the cable
operator's showing. The city shall issue an order stating that it is seeking
commission assistance and serve a copy of the order on the cable operator
before the thirty (30) day deadline.
      (3)   If the rates are tolled with respect to current rates, the rates
may remain in effect subject to refund as specified in §
6A-107. If the rates are tolled with regard to a proposed increase, the
increase in rates shall not go into effect unless the city orders that they
shall go into effect subject to refund.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-107. RATES SUBJECT TO REFUNDS.
   If the city chooses to toll the period to review current rates, the current
rates will remain in effect subject to refund. In like manner, if the city
chooses to toll the period to review a proposed rate increase, it may permit
the proposed rate increase to go into effect subject to refund if ordered by
the city commission. If the city has taken no action at the end of the
additional ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150) days, the proposed rate
increase shall go into effect subject to refund. In all cases, the city shall
issue a brief written order, in accordance with 47 C.F.R. § 76.933, requiring
the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of
the rate in issue and on whose behalf the amounts were paid. Refunds shall be
paid to the full extent allowed by law.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-108. CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE.
   Within ninety (90) days of any order of the city mandating a reduction in
rates, ordering a refund of rates, or prescribing rates at a level less than
the rate increase sought by the operator, the operator shall file with the city
a certification, signed by an authorized representative, that it has fully
complied with the city's order and describing in detail the steps taken to
implement the order and showing how refunds, including interest, were
calculated and distributed.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-109. PUBLIC COMMENT REQUIRED.
   Prior to taking any action to approve or disapprove rates, the city shall
provide an opportunity for interested parties to express their views concerning
the current or proposed rates either by:
      (1)   holding a public hearing,
      (2)   providing notice to citizens and others that they may submit
written comments or
      (3)   any other convenient method the city may determine.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94; Ord. No. 110-1994, 12-22-94)
§ 6A-110. INFLATION AND EXTERNAL COSTS ADJUSTMENTS AUTHORIZED.
   If the operator requests an increase in whole or in part based upon
inflation adjustments, programming costs increases, or other external factors
permitted by FCC regulations, the operator shall provide a detailed explanation
and documentation in support of the request, including calculations as to how
the specific request was derived and a copy of the contract for each
programming service cost that has increased. In addition, the operator shall
submit, through its chief financial officer or an independent certified
accountant, a sworn statement that it has examined all external costs and
offset any claimed increase by any decrease that has occurred and has otherwise
complied with the requirements of 47 C.F.R. § 76.922(d)(2).
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-111. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION TO BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL.
      (1)   The operator may request that portions of the filings and
information it supplies to the city in support of its current rates or a
proposed rate increase be kept confidential. The request may be made solely as
it relates to proprietary information. If possible, the portions of the filing
that are proprietary shall be segregated from the non-proprietary information.
The request that the information be kept confidential must state the reason
that the information would permit an unfair commercial advantage to competitors
of the cable operator.
      (2)   The mayor, or his designee, shall grant the request that the
information be kept confidential if he determines that the preponderance of
evidence shows disclosure would permit an unfair commercial advantage to
competitors of the cable operator. If the operator requests confidentiality and
the request is denied, the operator may withdraw its request for a rate
increase and the information it claims to be proprietary will be returned to
it.
      (3)   If the city requires any additional proprietary information other
than that provided by the operator in support of the rate filing, the city
shall state a justification for additional information and, where related to an
FCC Form 393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/1205) filing, the city shall indicate the
question or section of the form to which the request specifically relates.
      (4)   If the cable operator makes no request for confidentiality, the
material will be considered public records available for inspection by any
person pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-112. RATE INCREASE APPROVAL, DISAPPROVAL AUTHORIZED.
      (1)   After it completes its review of the rate filing submitted by the
operator, the city shall issue an order approving or disapproving the current
rates sought to be justified or the increased rates sought. If the city had
previously decided pursuant to § 6A-106 to allow rates to remain in effect or
go into effect subject to refund, and if the city disapproves the rates in
question, it shall issue an appropriate order directing that refunds be made.
The city may order refunds to the full extent permitted by the FCC regulations.
      (2)   The city may order a reduction in rates where necessary to bring
rates into compliance with FCC regulations. If the city determines that the
current rate or a proposed rate is unreasonable, it may prescribe a reasonable
rate.
      (3)   Before disapproving a rate or prescribing a rate, or ordering a
refund, the city shall ensure that the operator has had notice and opportunity
to comment on the rate in question or refund. The city shall provide ten (10)
days' written notice and give the operator the opportunity to submit written or
oral comments in addition to its rate filing.
      (4)   If the rates are disapproved in whole or in part or if the city
prescribes rates or orders refunds, the order issued by the city shall specify
the reasons for the decision. The city clerk shall provide written notice to
the operator of the city's decision by providing a copy of the resolution or
order.
      (5)   The city's decision approving or disapproving the rate, in whole or
in part, or prescribing rates, may, by the operator or by any citizen
submitting oral or written comment to the city prior to the order rendering the
decision, be appealed to the FCC or as otherwise allowed by law.
(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)
§ 6A-113. ENFORCEMENT.
   The operator is required to comply with the terms and provisions of this
chapter. If the operator violates any order of the city with respect to rates,
it shall be subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) a day
for each day it fails to comply. Violation of this chapter or of any order with
respect to rates may be considered a violation of the franchise agreement
between the operator and the city.

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 9-1. Statutory authorization.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS Ch. 100 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Commission of Nicholasville, Kentucky, hereby adopts the
following floodplain management ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-2. Findings of fact.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of Nicholasville are subject to periodic
inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-3. Statement of purpose.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-4. Objectives.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; and
      (7)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area.
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.

Sec. 9-5. Definitions.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A Zone. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   Accessory structure (Appurtenant structure). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. Accessory structures should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory
structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   Accessory use. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

one hundred (100)-year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration
is complete these areas will still experience residual flooding from other
flooding sources.
   A99 zone.  That part of the SFHA inundated by the one hundred (100)-year
flood which is to be protected from the one hundred (100)-year flood by a
federal flood protection system under construction. No base flood elevations

open space plans.
   Floodplain Management Regulations.  This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   Floodproofing. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   Floodproofing Certificate. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant

with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   Flood way. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.

regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   Freeboard.  A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
   Fraud and victimization.  As related in Sec. 9-51 et seq. means that the
variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In
examining this requirement, the City Commission will consider the fact that
every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years.
Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation
are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods,
while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to
all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood
damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property,
unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only
at very high flood insurance rates.

shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   Governing body. The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   Hazard potential. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   Highest adjacent grade. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   Historic Structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a

either:
      (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior, or
      (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC).
      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) for the cost to
elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.

drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to require
approval by the cabinet In the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
subsection (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.

constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   Levee System. A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. For a
levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met:
      (1)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
      (2)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state
agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community
participating in the NFIP.
   Limited storage. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   Lowest adjacent grade.  The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support,
or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion
of construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or
landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure's foundation
system.
   Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or
without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required

letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four (4) digits represent the map
panel. The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first
revision.)
   Market value. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or
adjusted assessed values.
   Mean sea level (MSL).  The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on a community's FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988.
   Mitigation.  Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
costs of disaster response and recovery.
   Mudslide (i.e. mudflow). Describes a condition where there is a river, flow,
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e. mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is
in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   Mudslide (i.e. mudflow) area management. The operation of and overall

flood insurance available to owners of property tn participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the

on or after the effective date of Nicholasville's floodplain management
regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   New manufactured home park or subdivision. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the

conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   One-Hundred Year Flood (100-Year Flood) (see Base Flood). The flood that has
a one percent (1%) or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one
hundred (100)-year flood. Over the life of a thirty (30)-year loan, there is a
twenty-six percent (26%) chance of experiencing such a flood with the SFHA.
   Participating community . A community that voluntarily elects to participate
in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that
are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.
   Pre-FIRM construction. Construction or substantial improvement, which
started on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the
initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later.
   Post-FIRM construction. Construction or substantial improvement that started

7. Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished by
Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may include,
but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing
the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question;
existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
      (1)   Application stage.
      a.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      b.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      c.   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in Sec. 9-32(2) and Sec.
9-34(2);
      d.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      (2)   Construction stage.
      a.   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, Al-30, AH, and A
zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      b.   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a

         c.   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner;
         d.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, “adversely
affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data.  When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Sec.
9-7, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize

         a.   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth
number is specified.
         b.   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one (1.0) foot above the base
flood elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator
will determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined.
Methods include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical
data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be
produced.
Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060,
states as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit:
The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries
(and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where
FEMA maps arc not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
(0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
         c.   In all other zones, elevated one (1.0) foot above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (1) or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities:
         a.   Be floodproofed below an elevation one (1.0) foot above the level
of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
         c.   Have the lowest floor, including basement, crawlspace, mechanical
equipment, and ductwork, elevated no lower than one (1.0) foot above the level
of the base flood elevation; or
         d.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall
be provided to the official as set forth in Sec.
9-22(1) c.
         e.   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (4)
         f.   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation one (1.0) foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical
Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
            (i)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect; or
            (ii)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
      (3)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements
of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
         a.   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
            (i)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject
to flooding;
            (ii)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or
higher than the exterior foundation grade); and
            (iii)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
      b.   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (sta   ndard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
         c.   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
      (4)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
         a.   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood

               (A)   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and
               (B)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1.0)
foot above the level of the base flood elevation, and
               (C)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
         b.   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage
as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that
the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
            (i)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no
lower than one (1.0) foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or
            (ii)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no
less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
         c.   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, AI-
30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must

consecutive days;
            (ii)    Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            (iii)   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured
homes”.
            (iv)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
      (5)   Flood ways. Located within areas of special flood hazard
established in Sec.
9-7, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
         a.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
         b.   If Sec.
9-32(5) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and
other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Sec.
9-31 et seq.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-33. Standards for streams without established base flood elevation
(unnumbered “A” zones) and/or floodways.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Sec.
9-7, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
      (2)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with Sec.
9-7.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-34. Standards for shallow flooding zones.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Sec.
9-7, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   All new construction and substantia! improvements of residential
structures shall. Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall:
      a.   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one (1) foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in Sec.
9-32(2).
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-35. Standards for subdivision proposals.
   (a)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
   (b)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (c)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
   (d)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available
(Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data tor
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.
   (e)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood
elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-36. Standards for accessory structures in all zones beginning with the
letter ‘A.’
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated ‘A’
the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Structure must be non-habitable;
      (2)   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;
      (3)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one (1) foot above
grade, total openings are to be one square inch per one square foot of floor
area, at least two (2) openings required on opposite wails;
      (4)   Built of flood resistant materials below a level one (1.0) foot
above the base flood elevation;
      (5)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;
      (6)   Can only be used for storage or parking;
      (7)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-37. Critical facilities.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of the base flood
elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-38--9-50. Reserved.
ARTICLE IV. APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
Sec. 9-51. Nature of variances.
   (a)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the properly owners.
   (b)   It is the duty of the City Commission to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-52. Designation and Duties of Variance and Appeal Board.
   (a)   The City Commission of Nicholasville shall establish an Appeal Board
consisting of members of the Board of Adjustments.
   (b)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
   (c)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local District Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-53. Appeals/variance procedures.
   In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-54. Conditions for Variances.
   (a)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Commission need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Commission
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
chapter.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sec.
9-53 (1) through (11) are satisfied and that the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a
public nuisance.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-55. Variance notification.
   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)    The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty- five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage, and;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property, A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Nicholasville Recorder and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-56. Historic Structures.
   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” (see definition in Sec.
9-5) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)
Sec. 9-57. No impact certification within the floodway.
   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does
not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that
compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
   (e)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the mayor or other
person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the
state court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was
addressed resides, was served or transacts business.

imprisoned not more than one (1) year, or both. Any person who, with intent
thereby to mislead the mayor, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or

10-29(d) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes

settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained or in the
complaint made to the mayor and which practice forms the basis for the action

committed and imposing the civil fine as set forth in the citation, and the
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order to
District Court.

by regular first-class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; personal

fine set forth in the citation, and the alleged violator shall be deemed to

whether a violation was committed. If it is determined that no violation was
committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered. If it is

ordinance, or require the offender to remedy a continuing violation to avoid a
fine, or both.

determination of the codes enforcement officer that the violations described in
a citation were committed by the person to whom the citation was issued becomes
final, and the violations identified therein continue thereafter, the city
shall cause those violations to be abated through either employees of the city
or contracts with others.

(Code 1972, § 13-3; Ord. No. 136-1995, 6-22-95)
§ 12-7 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.
§ 12-7.1 PURPOSE.
   The intent of the board of commissioners in adopting legislation regulating
adult entertainment establishments within the city is to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations that will reduce the adverse impact that such adult
entertainment has had in the city and to protect the health, safety, morals,
and general welfare of the citizens of Nicholasville, Kentucky.
§ 12-7.2 FINDING OF FACT.
   Based upon evidence and testimony presented at public meeting before the
Board of Commission of the city, the past experiences of the city and the
experiences which revoked the business license of two (2) massage parlors, the
desire of other adult entertainment establishments to locate within the city
and the documented experiences of other governmental units within and without
of this state in dealing with the impact of adult entertainment, the Board of
Commission hereby finds as follows:
   (a)   Establishments may attempt to locate within the city limits of
Nicholasville where adult entertainment occurs as a commercial venture.
   (b)   Establishments exist or may exist within the city limits of
Nicholasville where the superficial tissues of one person are manipulated,
rubbed, stroked, kneaded, and/or touched by a second person, accompanied by the
display of, or exposure of, specified anatomical areas; or dancers,
entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for various forms of
commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing
specified anatomical areas.
   (c)   When the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) above are
present in an establishment within the city, other activities which are
illegal, immoral, or unhealthful in nature tend to accompany them, to
concentrate around them, and are exacerbated or aggravated by them. Such other
activities include, but are not limited to, the following: Prostitution,
pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior exposing
minors to harmful materials, sale of possession of controlled substances, and
violent crimes against persons and property.
   (d)   There is a higher incidence of certain types of criminal behavior
among employees of establishments engaged in the activities described above in
subsection (a) and subsection (b) than among employees of other types of
commercial establishments.
   (e)   When the activities described in subsection (a) and subsection (b)
above are present in establishments within the limits of the city they tend to
attract an undesirable number of transients, bring blight to neighborhoods,
adversely affect neighboring businesses, in various ways including, but not
limited to, driving away customers and causing hours of operation to be
restricted, lower property values of surrounding properties, promote crimes,
particularly those as detailed in subsection (c) above, impact on the morals
and values of the school children who must regularly be exposed to undesirable
elements while walking to and from school as well as after school hours, and
ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations or fail to
locate in the city.
   (f)   In order to preserve the public peace in good order and to safeguard
the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the city and its citizens,
it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate establishments such as
those described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) above.
   (g)   Physical contact within establishments in which the activities
described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) above occurred between persons
exhibiting specified anatomical areas and patrons or spectators poses a threat
to the individual health of both individuals and promotes the spread of
communicable and social diseases.
   (h)   Establishments engaged in the business operations and activities
described in subsections (a) and (b) are commercial ventures, operated for the
purpose of making a profit, and as such are proper subjects for regulation by
the city in the interest of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of
its citizens and those individuals visiting the city.
   (i)   The adult entertainment described as occurring in the city does not
contain any element of protected communication and is expressly found by the
Board of Commission to be conduct rather than expression.
   (j)   The city would incur significant financial burdens in regulating and
policing the adult entertainment establishments over and above regulatory fees
and in a disproportionate percentage as compared to other commercial
activities.

§ 12-7.10 PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA.
   (a)   Any license issued under this section may, with notice to the holder
thereof and hearing as hereinafter provide for, be revoked, suspended, placed
on probationary status, or some combination thereof, by the Board of
Commission:
      (1)   If, within twelve (12) months prior to the date on which charges
are filed, there has been a conviction of any licensee or his agent, servants,
or employees for any action or activity occurring in, on, or at the premises
covered by the license in violation of any provision of this chapter or any
other ordinance of the city, or of any criminal or penal statute of the
Commonwealth of Kentucky against gambling disorderly conduct, or any other
criminal or penal offense;
      (2)   If any person is disorderly in, on, or at the premises covered by

on or at the licensed premises; or
      (3)   If the licensee or their agents, servants, or employees shall
misrepresent any material facts as to the kind of business in his adult
entertainment, payroll and/or business license return, or any other fact for
obtaining or renewing said license or necessary to determine the amount of
license tax to be paid.
   (b)   When the Board of Commission has probable cause to believe that a
license should be revoked for any of the causes enumerated herein, it shall be
its duty to prefer charges against the holder of such license by filing a
statement of such charges against the holder of such license with the City
Clerk. The charges shall be in writing and each charge shall be clearly set
out. Within three (3) days after filing of said charges, a notice of the filing
of said charges and of the time of hearing thereof shall be mailed to the
licensee at the address shown on the license and hearing before the Board of
Commission shall be held within ten (10) days after the mailing of said
charges. At the hearing, the evidence shall be recorded, and the introduction
of any judgment of conviction in any court of competent jurisdiction of the
licensee or any agent, servant, or employee thereof, shall be conclusive
evidence that such a violation occurred. The existence of any prior judgment of
conviction for the same or similar offense, under the same ownership/management
as those being asserted as the basis for the current licensing hearing, may be
considered as actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of the
engagement in such illegal conduct on the licensed premises. The licensee shall
be permitted to present evidence in defense of the charges and shall be given
the opportunity to refute that such licensee knew or should have known of the
existence of such illegal conduct which led to a conviction on the part of the
licensee or any agent, servant or employee thereof. The action and decision of
the Board of Commission on the charges shall be reduced to writing and recorded
in the minute book. Upon a finding that the licensee knew or should have known
of the existence of such illegal conduct resulting in a decision by the Board
of Commission to revoke, suspend, place on probationary status, or some
combination thereof, a license issued under this chapter, all business activity
at the location shall cease immediately for the period of suspension or
revocation.
§ 12-7.11 SAME – RENEWALS OR TRANSFERS.
   (a)   Renewal of any existing adult entertainment establishment license
during a period when charges against same are pending for a hearing before the
Board of Commission of revocation thereof shall not constitute a waiver of such
charges.
   (b)   No transfer of an existing adult entertainment establishment shall be
permitted so long as charges against same are pending for a hearing before the
Board of Commission.
   (c)   In the event an adult entertainment establishment license is
surrendered by the license holder pending charges against said licensee and
prior to any revocation hearing, or is revoked after hearing, no new license
certificate shall be issued to any person, when in the discretion of the city
the license holder, or the holder of a license surrendered in lieu of
revocation, is to operate a business under a new adult entertainment
establishment license, merely in the name of another person, the same
constituting a "sham" application.

   The purpose of this article is to provide the city and police department
personnel with safe, efficient and equitable system for the removal of damaged,
disabled, abandoned, illegally parked, or where a vehicle or its driver is
involved in illegal activity from city streets. All applications, fees, lists,
complaints, or other written information concerning the administration of this
section shall be maintained and monitored by the chief of police, under the
direction and supervision of the city commission. All requests by police
personnel for wrecker and/or storage facility services within the city, shall
be administered through the police department as directed herein.
(Ord. No. 810-2011, 8-1-11)
Sec. 22-71. Removal of wrecked or disabled vehicles.
   (a)   Preference calls.
      (1)    The owner or lawful operator of a damaged or disabled vehicle
shall generally have the right to determine the wrecker service to be summoned
and the destination of said vehicle. The police officer in charge of the
accident or disabled vehicle shall honor the motor owner/operator's preference
and take reasonable steps to carry out the notification of the appropriate
wrecker service, unless in the opinion of the police officer, the request is
either contrary to accepted police practices or would create a risk to the
general public.
      (2)   If, in any case, the police officer believes that an alternative to
the owner or operator's preference is necessary in order to protect the general
public or promote legitimate police matters, then the police officer shall act
in accordance with his/her training and skill by selecting an alternative
method of removal and/or site for storage.
      (3)   In any event, the police officer must advise the telecommunicator
of all pertinent information necessary for each towed vehicle. The
telecommunicator will record the relevant information concerning the wrecker
service and storage facility utilized in each incident in the “wrecker tow log”
maintained in the telecommunications office.
      (4)   No owner, employee, or agent for any wrecker service summoned to
the scene of an accident or disabled vehicle shall participate in, or
influence, the decision of the owner/operator as set out in subsection (1) of
this section.
   (b)   Non-preference calls. Where the motor vehicle operator is injured,
unavailable or otherwise indicates no preference for the destination of a
wrecker service, then the telecommunicator shall contact a wrecker service.
(Ord. No. 810-2011, 10-1-11)

rendered pursuant to this article than they would charge for identical services
to private customers. Wrecker services shall further notify the city of any
intended increases in wrecker service charges at least thirty (30) days prior
to and after the City Commission has granted permission to the implementation
of those new charges.
   (e)   The wrecker service shall have personnel available during reasonable
business hours to provide information to the city and vehicles owners, owner's
agency or representative concerning the transportation of storage of towed
motor vehicles and their release.
   (f)   The wrecker service shall be responsible for all losses, theft, or
damages to vehicles from the time they are towed until the vehicle is released
to the owner, a dealership, auto repair, or storage facility.
   (g)   The wrecker service shall provide a secured inside and outside storage
with an alarm system for vehicles that may require holding for processing, or
other special needs, and if a vehicle held on the impoundment lot, no per day
cost will be added to the towing bill when it is being held at the request of
the Police Department.
   (h)   The wrecker service shall employ only those operators holding a valid
Kentucky Operator's license without conditions or restrictions that would
impair the driver's ability to operate wrecker equipment (see
Appendix C), and shall not sublet any wrecker services to any third parties.
   (i)   Any wrecker service contacted by the police department must provide
the city with certificates of insurance insuring said wrecker service against
theft, vandalism, personal injury, damages or other casualty losses in amounts
and on such terms as are prescribed by the Kentucky Department of
transportation. Said insurance shall provide coverage for the wrecker, the
towed vehicle and storage lot. The wrecker service must provide the city with
annual renewals of said insurance and the insurance policy must show the city
as an additional insured.
   (j)   The wrecker service must furnish an adequate record system for all
motor vehicles and property towed and stored, and adequate storage for all
personal property if removed from vehicle.
   (k)   Said record shall contain information including but not limited to, a
log indicating vehicle description (make, model, license, VIN number, color,
etc.), along with the date and time of the wrecker service on each call for
service. A copy of this record must be turned into the Chief of Police by the
first day of every month. (See

facility must meet the city planning and zoning specifications for storage of
vehicles within a specified area.
   (b)   Inclusion of wrecker service and their storage facilities on service
list shall not be construed as an employment or contractual relationship
between the city and said business or facility, and the city assumes no
liability by virtue of this article for damages claimed by vehicle owners, or
any and all other persons who may present a claim for damages against the city
in connection with the towing, repair and/or storage of a motor vehicle.

APPENDIX C
Wrecker Service Requirements and Restrictions
      (1)   If the gross combined weight rating (GCWR) of the tow truck and its
towed vehicle is 26,001 pounds or more, and the towed vehicle alone exceeds
10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR), then the driver needs a Group
A CDL. If the GVWR of the tow truck alone is 26,001 pounds or more, and the
driver either (a) drives the tow truck without a vehicle in tow, or (b) drives
the tow truck with a towed vehicle of 10,000 pounds or less GVWR, then the
driver needs a Group B CDL. A driver of a tow truck or towing configuration
that does not fit either configuration description above, requires a Group C
CDL only if he or she tows a vehicle required to be placarded for hazardous
materials on a "subsequent move," i.e., after the initial movement of the
disabled vehicle to the nearest storage or repair facility.
      (2)   All owners and operators must submit to the chief of police a
legible color copy of their valid Kentucky Operator's license prior to towing
for the Police Department. Furthermore, an operator cannot have a DUI (Driving
under the Influence of intoxicants) conviction within the past 12-month period
nor can an operator have had two (2) DUI convictions within the last 60-month
period. Neither an owner nor operator can have any felony convictions, nor can
they have any serious misdemeanor convictions within the previous five (5)
years that may be detrimental or discredit the reputation of the Nicholasville
Police Department or the City of Nicholasville. Determination of what
constitutes serious misdemeanor offenses will be determined by the chief of
police.

form, pay the appropriate fee and receive a copy of the city's regulations
governing the discharge of liquid wastes from septage hauler trucks. All
persons receiving such permits shall agree, in writing to abide by all
applicable provisions of their waste hauler permit. The WWTP Superintendent
will certify the capacity of each tank before issuance of a waste hauler
permit.
      The discharge of all hauled wastewater wastes must be performed at the
Jessamine Creek WWTP on normal working days (Monday through Friday) 6:45 a.m.
to 3:45 p.m. A Hauled Wastewater Discharge Manifest certifying the origin of
all waste must accompany each load. Hauled wastewater is subject to sampling at
the discretion of WWTP staff based on information recorded on the Manifest. All
monitoring/testing costs will be billed to the Waste Haulers as described
hereinafter.
      The Hauled Wastewater Discharge Manifest must contain the following:
Hauler (Company Name), Permit Number, Gallons of Waste, Generator Waste,
Address of Generator of Waste, Date & Time Loaded, Hauler's Signature, Date &

($1,000.00) for each occurrence.
      Fees: Annual Per Truck Discharge Permit $50.00
The Septic Waste Discharge Rate will be set by the Director in recognition of
industry accepted cost of service principles and prevailing market conditions.
      Waste Haulers will be billed by the City of Nicholasville through
miscellaneous invoicing once per month. Provided a sight glass is mounted in
the middle of a truck's tank, the capacity of the tank will be deemed either
half of a load or a full load.
   (e)   Express surcharge rates.
      (1)   For those users whose wastewater has a greater strength than normal
domestic wastewater, a surcharge in addition to the normal user charge, will be
collected.

NH3-N  $0.795 per pound
 
      (3)   Method of billing surcharges - the excessive strength surcharge
shall be based on the following formula, with the total applied to the monthly
bill of affected users:
      Formula
      (A(D-300)+B(E-350)+C(F-30))(.00834)(G) = Surcharge Payment ($/Mo.)
      Where formula components are as follows:
      A.   Surcharge rate for BOD, in $/pound.
      B.   Surcharge rate of SS, in $/pound.
      C.   Surcharge rate for NH3-N in $/pound.
      D.   User's average BOD concentration, in mg/l.

      F.   User's average NH3-N concentration, in mg/l.
      G.   User's monthly flow to wastewater works, per 1,000 gallons. No
reduction in wastewater service charges, fees, or taxes shall be permitted
because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the wastewater works
contain less than 300 mg/l of BOD, 350 mg/l of SS or 30 mg/l of NH3-N.
   (f)   The city clerk shall maintain financial records to accurately account
for revenues generated by the treatment system and expenditures for operation
and maintenance of the system, including normal replacement costs.
   (g)   The director of public utilities shall review not less often than
annually the wastewater contribution of users, the total cost of OM&R of the
wastewater works, debt service obligations, and user charge rates. Based on
such review, the director shall revise, when necessary, the schedule of user
charge rates to accomplish the following:
      (1)   Maintain an equitable distribution of OM&R costs among users of the
treatment system; and
      (2)   Generate sufficient revenues to offset costs associated with the
proper operation and maintenance of the treatment works and to meet debt
service requirements.
      (3)   Excessive strength and toxicity surcharges shall be reviewed at the
time of and in conjunction with the review of user charges. Surcharge rates
shall be revised where necessary to reflect current treatment and monitoring
costs.

this schedule shall be subject to the provisions of the power cost adjustment
clause.
   (b)   Power cost adjustment clause charges (PCA). The above rate schedules
shall be subject to the power cost adjustment clause charges in addition to the
aforesaid rates. The power cost adjustment (PCA) is expressed as dollars per
kwh and is multiplied by the energy (kwh) sold during each billing period to
each customer’s usage. The PCA is designed to be calculated monthly based on
actual power costs and energy sales for the period. The following formula has
been designed to calculate the PCA:
      PCA = A/B - Base Rate where,
      PCA = The cost adjustment expressed as dollars per kwh to be multiplied
by the energy (kwh) sold during each billing period to customers on rate
schedules subject to the PCA.
      A = Actual expense for purchased power for the current period.
      B - Actual energy sales (kWh) for the current period from rates subject
to the PCA for the same period as “A” above.
      Base Rate = The base rate is the expense for purchased power, exclusive
of SEPA power cost, in the base period divided by energy sales in the base
period. The base rate reflects purchased power cost, expressed as dollars per
kWh, included in retail rates. The base rate effective July 1, 2019 is
$0.06685/kWh.
   (c)   Periodic adjustment of PC. Each period, the PCA formula is used to
calculate average purchased power costs per retail kWh sold and to determine
the adjustment to customer bills. If purchased power costs are lower than
estimated, the PCA is negative and customers receive a credit on their bill.
If, on the other hand, purchased power costs are higher than estimated, the PCA
is positive and customers receive an additional charge on their bill. The PCA
shall be adjusted at least annually to true up and over or under collection of
funds collected through the PCA.
   (d)   Determination of maximum billable load by including power corrected to
ninety percent (90%). The city reserves the right to place a KVA meter on
selected customer. The power factor will be determined by KW at time of peak
demand divided by KVA at time of peak demand.
      (KW, KVA = Actual power factor)
      KW  = P.F.
      KVA
KW billable will be adjusted as follows: KW at maximum demand x ninety percent
(90%) power factor divided by actual power factor equals billable KW.
      (KW x 90, Actual P.F. = adjusted KW)
      KW x 90 =  Billable KW)
      power factor
   The above calculation is used to adjust the billable KW demand only in the
months in which the power factor is below ninety percent (90%).
   The aforementioned formula will provide the city a method to recover its
additional power factor related costs in a manner similar to the method used by
the city's supplier, Kentucky Utilities.

Section 212 of the Act (33 U.S.C. 1292), which is owned in this instance by the
city. This definition includes any sewers that convey wastewater to the POTW
treatment plant, but does not include pipes, sewers or other conveyances not
connected to a facility providing treatment. For the purposes of this chapter,
"POTW" shall also include any sewers that convey wastewaters to the POTW from
persons outside the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users
of the city's POTW.

disposal system who (1) has a discharge flow of ten thousand (10,000) gallons
or more per day; or (2) has a flow greater than five percent (5%) of the flow
in the city's wastewater treatment system; or (3) has in his wastes toxic
pollutants as defined pursuant to Section 307 of the Act of state statutes and
rules; or (4) is found by the city, Commonwealth of Kentucky or the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to have significant impact, either
singularly or in combination with other contributing industries on the
wastewater treatment system, the quality of sludge, the system's effluent
quality, or air emissions generated by the system; or (5) has a reasonable
potential, in the opinion of the WWTP superintendent, to adversely affect the
POTW treatment plant (i.e., cause inhibition, pass through of pollutants,
sludge contamination or endangerment of POTW workers) or violate any
requirements of this chapter; or (6) is an industrial user subject to
categorical pretreatment standards under 40 CFR 403.6 and 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N.
      (a)   The city may determine that an industrial user subject to
categorical pretreatment standards is a "non-significant categorical industrial
user" rather than a "significant industrial user" on a finding that the
industrial user never discharges more than 100 gallons per day (gpd) of total
categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler
blowdown wastewater, unless specifically included in the pretreatment standard)
and the following conditions are met: (1) the industrial user, prior to the
city's finding, has consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards and requirements; (2) the industrial user annually
submits the certification statement required in 40 CFR 403.12(q) together with
any additional information necessary to support the certification statement;
and (3) the industrial user never discharges any untreated concentrated process
wastewater.
      (b)   Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in this section has
no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for
violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may at any time,
on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an industrial
user, and in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), determine that
such user should not be considered a "significant industrial user."
   Significant noncompliance (SNC). A user is defined as being in "significant
noncompliance" when one or more of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   Any discharge causing imminent endangerment to human health or the
environment or results in the use of the WWTP superintendent's emergency
authority under 40 CFR 403 to halt or prevent such a discharge; or
      (2)   Involves failure to report noncompliance accurately; or
      (3)   Results in a chronic violation defined here as sixty-six percent
(66%) or more of all measurements taken during a six (6) month period that
exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the
same pollutant parameter; or
      (4)   Results in a technical review criteria (TRC) violation defined here
as thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all measurements for each pollutant
parameter taken during a six (6) month period that equal or exceed the product
of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, and O&G and 1.2 for all other pollutants
except pH); or
      (5)   Any violation of a pretreatment effluent limit that the
pretreatment coordinator determines has caused, alone or in combination with
other discharges, interference or pass through at the WWTP; or
      (6)   Any discharge that endangers the WWTP personnel health/welfare; or
      (7)   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, failure to comply
with schedule milestones for starting or completing construction or attaining
final compliance by ninety (90) days or more after the schedule date; or
      (8)   Failure to provide required reports within thirty (30) days of the
due date; or
      (9)   Any violation, or group of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the wastewater superintendent
determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
   Slug load or slug discharge. Any discharge at a flow rate or concentration
which could cause a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in section
23-112 of this code. A "slug discharge" is any discharge of a non-routine,
episodic nature, including but not limited to an accidental spill or a non-
customary batch discharge, which has a reasonable potential to cause
interference or pass-through, or in any other way violate the POTW's
regulations, local limits or permit conditions.

Sec. 23-109. General discharge prohibitions.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged to the
public sewerage system the following described substances, materials, water, or
wastes if it appears likely, in the opinion of the superintendent, that such
wastes may harm the sewers, wastewater treatment process or equipment; have an
adverse effect on the receiving stream; may otherwise endanger life, limb, or
public property; or constitute a nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the
acceptability of these wastes, the superintendent shall give consideration to
such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and
velocities in the sewer, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the
wastewater treatment process, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant,
degree of treatability of wastes in the wastewater treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors. These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW
whether or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment
standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or
requirements. Discharges prohibited are:
      (1)   Any liquid or vapor having temperatures higher than one hundred
forty (140) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty (60) degrees Celsius).
      (2)   Any water or waste containing fats wax, grease, or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred (100) mg/l or containing substances
which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32)
degrees Fahrenheit and one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (zero (0)
degrees and sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius).
      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation
and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths (3/
4) horsepower or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the
superintendent.
      (4)   Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the
POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two (2) successive
readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the system
(or at any point in the system) be more than five percent (5%) nor any single
reading over ten percent (10%) of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter.
      (5)   Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow
in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment
facilities.
      (6)   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or greater than 10.5, or
any wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or
hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW. For users that
utilize a continuous pH monitoring system to determine compliance with the pH
limitations established under this ordinance and/or an industrial user permit,
a violation of the pH limitations will be deemed to have occurred when a
continuous individual reading is outside the pH limitation range established
under this ordinance and/or by an industrial user permit.
      (7)   Any waters or wastes containing toxic substances or pollutants to
such degree that they either singularly or by interaction with other pollutants
constitute a hazard to humans or animals or inhibit or damage the wastewater
treatment processes or tend to concentrate in the wastewater sludge to such a
level that prevents the use of acceptable sludge disposal methods or pass
through the treatment process unremoved and at such concentration that causes a
violation of effluent limitations or water quality standards which are or may
be established by state or federal agencies having jurisdiction. A toxic
pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified
pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act.
      (8)   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either
singularly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a
public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the
sewers for their maintenance or repair.
      (9)   Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process where the
POTW is pursuing a reuse and reclamation program. In no case shall a substance
discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or
disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations developed under Section 405 of
the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or
disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act,
the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge
management method being used.
      (10)   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its KPDES and/
or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards.
      (11)   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process.
      (12)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds
forty (40) degrees Celsius (one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit) and/or
wastewater with a temperature at the introduction to the sanitary sewer system
that exceeds sixty (60) degrees Celsius (one hundred forty (140) degrees
Fahrenheit).
      (13)   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released at a flow and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference
to the POTW. In no case shall a discharge have a flow rate or contain
concentration or qualities or pollutants that exceed for any time period longer
than fifteen (15) minutes more than five (5) times the average twenty-four (24)
hour concentration, quantities, or flow during normal operations.
      (14)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes.
      (15)   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
      (16)   Any waste(s) or wastewater(s) classified as a hazardous waste by
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) without a 60-day prior
notification of such discharge to the wastewater superintendent. This
notification must include the name of the hazardous waste, the EPA hazardous
waste number, type of discharge, volume/mass of discharge and time of
occurrence(s). The wastewater superintendent may prohibit or place conditions
on the discharge(s) at any time.
   (b)   When the superintendent determines that a user(s) is contributing to
the POTW any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, the superintendent shall:
      (1)   Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the POTW;
and
      (2)   Develop effluent limitation(s) for such user to correct the
interference with the POTW.
   (c)   Additional specific user requirements and discharge limitations are
contained in section
23-112.

Sec. 23-111. Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards.
   Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the
approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
pretreatment standards. “Consistent removal” shall mean reduction in the amount
of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by the system in ninety-five percent (95%) of the samples taken when
measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of Title
40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Part 403 “General Pretreatment
Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution,” promulgated pursuant to
the Act. The city may modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal
pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, Part 403,
Section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is
obtained.

COD              $0.636/pound in excess of 900 mg/l
TSS              $0.730/pound in excess of 300 mg/l
NH3-N            $1.590/pound in excess of 25 mg/l
 
   The surcharge will be calculated as follows:
   Surcharge = (X - Y) x Q x 8.34 x R, where:
   X = Actual parameter concentration
   Y = Allowable parameter concentration
   Q = Total discharge quantity in million gallons for a specific surcharge
calculation period
   R = Surcharge rate in $/lb.
   For BOD and COD surcharges, the parameter formula giving the larger
surcharge payment will be used for the given period.
   There will be a minimum surcharge of $10, below which there will not be
collection or assessment.

Sec. 23-118. Accidental discharges.
   (a)   Generally. Each user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this
division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the superintendent for review and shall be
approved by the superintendent before construction of the facility. All
existing users shall complete such a plan within ninety (90) days after the
effective date of this division. Construction shall be completed within one
hundred eighty (180) days after approval of plans and notification by the
superintendent. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the
effective date of this division shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into
the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the
superintendent. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures
shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the
user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division. In the
case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to
immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the accidental discharge. The notification shall include
location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective
actions taken and to be taken.
   (b)   Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental
discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notifications shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this division or
other applicable law.
   (c)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.

      (7)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not
be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval of the utility
director/superintendent. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with
the terms and conditions of the existing permit.
   (c)   Reporting requirements for permittee.
      (1)   Compliance date report. Within ninety (90) days following the date
for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of
a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the
POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit
to the superintendent a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow
for these process units in the user facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional pretreatment and time schedule is necessary
to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user. Where compliance schedules are required, the following
conditions shall apply:
         a.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);
         b.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
         c.   The user shall submit a progress report to the WWTP
superintendent no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or
not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and,
if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule.
      (2)   Periodic compliance reports.
         a.   Any user subject to pretreatment standards, after the compliance
date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after
commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the superintendent
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the superintendent, a report indicating the nature
and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all
daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow
reported in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. At the discretion of the
superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local high or low rates,
holidays, budget cycles, etc., the superintendent may agree to alter the months
during which the above reports are to be submitted. The report shall also
include the chain-of-custody (COG) forms, field data and any other information
required by the WWTP superintendent. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12 and section 23-000 of
this chapter.
         b.   The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users where
their imposition is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall indicate the mass of pollutants
regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports
shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge including
the flow and the nature and concentration or production and mass, where
requested by the superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring
shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. Where an effluent
from a categorical industrial process(es) is mixed prior to treatment with
wastewater other than that generated by the regulated process, fixed
alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge permit by the
wastewater superintendent. These alternative limits shall be applied to the
mixed effluent and shall be calculated using the combined wastestream formula
and/or flow-weighted average formula as defined in 40 CFR 403. Where the
effluent limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in
terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production (production-based standard),
the wastewater superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or of effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent permit limitations
applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be subject to all permit
limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully comply
with these alternative limits. All categorical users subject to production-
based standards must report production rates annually so that alternative
permit limits can be calculated if necessary. The categorical user must notify
the wastewater superintendent thirty (30) days in advance of any major change
in production levels that will affect the limits for the discharge permit. All
wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept
clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user
to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for
the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
All analysis shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to the city.
Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures established by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency administrator pursuant to Section
304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amended thereto, or
with any other test procedures approved by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
administrator. Except as indicated in items (a) and (b) below in this
paragraph, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the WWTP superintendent. Where time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the WWTP
superintendent, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited
in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the WWTP superintendent, as appropriate. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. (a)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides
and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques. (b) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-
day compliance reports required in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four
(4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data
are available, the WWTP superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial user is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
         c.   Where 40 CFR, Part 136, as amended, does not include a sampling
or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis
shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EP
publication "Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants," April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Users subject to the reporting
requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection
and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring
activities required by this chapter, any additional records of information
obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent
of such requirements and documentation associated with best management
practices as may be required. Records shall include the date, exact place,
method and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples;
the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period
shall automatically be extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or the city or where the user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention by the WWTP superintendent. All sampling analyses done in
accordance with approved federal EPA procedures by the industrial user during a
reporting period, whether required by the city or not, shall be submitted to
the WWTP superintendent. The industrial user must receive the approval of the
WWTP superintendent before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring
facilities to be used in all required sampling.
      (3)   Baseline monitoring report.
         a.   A baseline monitoring report (BMR) must be submitted to the WWTP
superintendent by all categorical industrial users at least ninety (90) days
prior to initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. The BMR must contain,
at a minimum, the following:
            1.   Production data: a process description, SIC code number, raw
materials used, chemicals used, final product, pretreatment industrial category
(if applicable), and a schematic which indicates points of discharge to the
sewer system.
            2.   Identifying information to include name, address of facility,
owner(s), contact person and any other permits held by the facility.
            3.   Wastewater characteristics: total plant flow, types of
discharges, average and maximum flows from each process.
            4.   Nature/concentration of pollutants: analytical results for all
pollutants regulated by this division and/or any applicable federal
pretreatment standard and sample type and location. All analyses must conform
with 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto.
            5.   Information concerning any pretreatment equipment used to
treat the facility's discharge.
            6.   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative as defined in Article I(B)(4) and certified by a
qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met
on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the
pretreatment standards and requirements.
            7.   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule
shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable
pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet
the requirements set out in § 52.52 of this chapter.
         b.   New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in
subsections (c)(3)a.3. and (c)(3)a.4. above, but at no time shall a new source
commence discharge(s) to the public sewer of substances that do not meet all
provisions of this division. All new sources must be in compliance with all
provisions of this division and state and federal pretreatment regulations
prior to commencement of discharge to the public sewer.
      (4)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions
shall apply to all compliance schedules required by this division:
         a.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards.
         b.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months.
         c.   The user shall submit a progress report to the WWTP
superintendent no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or
not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and,
if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule; and in no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the WWTP superintendent.
   (d)   Monitoring facilities. The city shall require significant users to
provide and operate, at the user's expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or
internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility will ordinarily be located
on the user's premises but the city may, when such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in a public right-of-way. The superintendent shall review and
approve the location, plans, and specifications for such monitoring facilities
and may require the facilities to be constructed to provide for separate
monitoring and sampling of industrial waste and sanitary sewage flows. All
sampling and monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the
city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days
following approval of the location plans and specifications.
   (e)   Inspection and sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in
the performance of any of their duties. The city approval authority and EPA
shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval
authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes
of performing their specific responsibilities.
   (f)   Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all
federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as
specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city
for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the
facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this
division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the
user's initiation of the changes.
      (1)   The city shall annually publish in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW, a list of the users which were not in compliance with any
pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the twelve (12)
previous months. EPA guidelines will be utilized in determining those
industries that can be classified in "significant noncompliance" of the
division.
      (2)   All records relating to the compliance with pretreatment standards
shall be made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon
request.
   (g)   Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs, and
from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
      (1)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this division, the KPDES
permit, sludge disposal system permit, and/or the pretreatment programs,
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
      (2)   Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be
transmitted to other parties unless Nicholasville is ordered to do so by a
court or other authority of competent jurisdiction.
   (h)   Signatory requirements and certification. All applications, reports or
information submitted to the city shall be signed and certified in accordance
with the following requirements. Written designation of the signatory official
must be received by the city prior to acceptance of any application or other
required document.
      (1)   All permit applications shall be signed:
         a.   For a corporation: by a principal executive officer of at least
the level of vice-president;
         b.   For a partnership or sole proprietorship: by a general partner or
the proprietor, respectively;
      (2)   All other correspondence, reports and self-monitoring reports shall
be signed by a person described above or by a duly authorized representative of
that person. A person is a duly authorized representative only if:
         a.   The authorization is made in writing by a person described above;
         b.   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having facility or activity, such as the position of plant manager, manager or
position of equivalent responsibility.

(Ord. No. 045-1989, § 4, 11-28-89; Ord. No. 778-2010, 3-22-10; Ord. No. 823-
2012, 1-23-12)
Sec. 23-121. Enforcement.
   (a)   Harmful contributions. The utility director/superintendent may suspend
the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution permit when
such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the utility director/
superintendent, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons or the environment, causes interference to the POTW, or
causes the utility director/superintendent to violate any condition of its
KPDES permit.
      Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate
the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the utility director/superintendent shall take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to
any individuals. The utility director/superintendent shall reinstate the
wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon
proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. A detailed written
statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be
submitted to the utility director/superintendent within fifteen (15) days of
the date of occurrence.
   (b)   Revocation of permit. Any user who violates the following conditions
of this division or applicable state and federal regulations is subject to
revocation of its permit.
      (1)   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of his discharge.
      (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics.
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring.
      (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
   (c)   Notification of violation.
      (1)   Whenever the utility director/superintendent finds that any user
has violated or is violating this division, wastewater contribution permit, or
any prohibition or limitation of requirements contained herein, the utility
director/superintendent may serve upon such person a written notice stating the
nature of the violation. Within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice, a
plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the utility
director/superintendent by the user.
      (2)   If sampling performed by an individual user indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours. The
user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results to the
control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the
violation. Exception to this regulation is only if the control authority
performs sampling within the same time period for the same pollutant in
question.
   (d)   Show cause hearing.

network.
         g.   There are no identified violations of the applicable provisions
of IEEE 1547, "Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric
Power Systems".
         h.   NPU will not be required to construct any facilities on its own
system to accommodate the small generator. Customers desiring a Level 1
interconnection shall submit a "LEVEL 1 - Application for Interconnection" and
provide a non-refundable inspection and processing fee of twenty-five dollars
($25.00). NPU shall notify customer as to whether the request is approved or,
if denied, the reason(s) for denial. If additional information is required, NPU
will notify customer.
      (3)   Level 2. A Level 2 installation is defined as generator that is not
inverter-based; that uses equipment not certified as meeting the requirements
of Underwriters Laboratories Standard 1741, or that does not meet one (1) or
more of the conditions required of a Level 1 small generator. A Level 2
application will be approved if the generating facility meets NPU's technical
interconnection requirements based on IEEE 1547. Customer desiring a Level 2
interconnection shall submit a "LEVEL 2 - Application for Interconnection." NPU
shall notify customer as to whether the request is approved or, if denied, the
reason(s) for denial. If additional information is required, NPU will notify
customer. Customer submitting a "Level 2 - Application for Interconnection"
will provide a non-refundable inspection and processing fee of one hundred
dollars ($100.00), and in the event that NPU determines an impact study to be
necessary, shall be responsible for any reasonable documented costs for the
initial impact study. Additional studies requested by customer shall be at
customer's expense.
   (d)   Conditions of interconnection. Customer may operate their small
generator in parallel with NPU's system only after the customer has submitted
NPU's written application for interconnection and received approval from NPU.
Prior to approval from NPU the customer must show compliance with all
applicable regulations and the following conditions:
      (1)   Customer shall install, operate, and maintain, at customer's sole
cost and expense, any control, protective, or other equipment on customer's
system required by NPU's technical interconnection requirements based on IEEE
1547, NEC, accredited testing laboratories, and the manufacturer's suggested
practices for safe, efficient and reliable operation of the small generating
facility in parallel with NPU's system. Customer bears full responsibility for
the installation, maintenance and safe operation of the small generating
facility. Upon reasonable request from NPU, customer shall demonstrate

inspections to verify that the installation, maintenance and operation of the
small generator comply with the requirements set forth herewith.
      (7)   For Level 1 and 2 generating facilities the customer shall furnish
and install on customer's side of the point of interconnection a safety
disconnect switch which shall be capable of fully disconnecting customer's
small generator from NPU's electric service under the full rated conditions of
customer's small generator. The external disconnect switch (EDS) shall be
located adjacent to NPU's meters or the location of the EDS shall be noted by
placing a sticker on the meter, and shall be of the visible break type in a
metal enclosure which can be secured by a padlock. If the EDS is not located
directly adjacent to the meter, customer shall be responsible for ensuring the
location of the EDS is properly and legibly identified for so long as the small
generator is operational. The disconnect switch shall be accessible to NPU
personnel at all times. NPU may waive the requirement for an external
disconnect switch for a small generator at its sole discretion, and on a case
by case basis.
      (8)   NPU shall have the right and authority at NPU's sole discretion to
isolate the generating facility or require the customer to discontinue
operation of the small generator if NPU believes that:
         a.   Continued interconnection and parallel operation of the small
generator with NPU's electric system creates or contributes (or may create or
contribute) to a system emergency on either NPU's or customer's electric
system;
         b.   The small generator is not in compliance with the requirements
set forth herewith, and the non-compliance adversely affects the safety,
reliability or power quality of NPU's electric system; or
         c.   The small generator interferes with the operation of NPU's
electric system. In non-emergency situations, NPU shall give customer notice of
noncompliance including a description of the specific noncompliance condition
and allow customer a reasonable time to cure the noncompliance prior to
isolating the generating facilities. In emergency situations, where NPU is
unable to immediately isolate or cause customer to isolate only the small
generator, NPU may isolate customer's entire facility.
      (9)   Customer agrees that, without the prior written permission from
NPU, no changes shall be made to the generating facility as initially approved.
Increases in small generator capacity will require a new "Application for
Interconnection" which will be evaluated on the same basis as any other new
application. Repair and replacement of existing generating facility components
with like components that meet UL 1741 certification requirements for Level 1
facilities and not resulting in increases in small generator capacity is
allowed without approval.
      (10)   Customer shall, indemnify, defend and hold harmless NPU and its
commissioners, officers, employees, agents, representatives and contractors
against and from all loss, claims, actions or suits, including costs and
attorneys fees, for or on account of any injury or death of persons or damage
to property resulting from, relating to, arising out of, or in connection with
customer or customer's employees, agents, representatives or contractors in
tampering with, repairing, maintaining or operating customer's small generator
or any related equipment or any facilities owned by NPU. The liability of NPU
to customer for injury to person or property shall be limited to the small
generator application fee.
      (11)   Customer shall maintain general liability insurance coverage
(through a standard homeowner's, commercial or other policy) for generating
facilities. Customer shall upon request provide NPU with proof of such
insurance at the time that application is made for small generator
interconnection.
      (12)   By entering into an interconnection agreement, or by inspection,
if any, or by non-rejection, or by approval, or in any other way, NPU does not
make any representation or give any warranty, express or implied, warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose as to the adequacy, safety,
compliance with applicable codes or requirements, or as to any other
characteristics, of the generating facility equipment, controls, and protective
relays and equipment.
      (13)   Customer's generating facility is transferable to other persons or
service locations only after notification to NPU has been made and verification
that the installation is in compliance with the requirements set forth
herewith. Upon written notification that an approved generating facility is
being transferred to another person, customer, or location, NPU will verify
that the installation is in compliance and provide written notification to the
customer(s) within twenty (20) business days. If the installation is no longer
in compliance, NPU will notify customer in writing and list what must be done
to place the facility in compliance.

Sec. 26-51. Access to facilities.
   (a)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the city.
   (b)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying
of records that must be kept under the conditions of a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
   (c)   Upon notifying the owner or owner's representative, the city shall
have the right to immediate access to the property to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge and/or
suspected illicit discharge.
   (d)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   (e)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
   (f)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city to a permitted facility, as
described in subsection (c) of this section, is a violation of any applicable
storm water discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator
of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the city reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this article.
   (g)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which storm water is discharged, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community
or environment, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any
court of competent jurisdiction.

DIVISION 6. PREVENTING, CONTROLLING, AND REDUCING STORM WATER POLLUTANTS
Sec. 26-60. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce storm water pollutants
by the use of best management practices.
   The city identified best management practices (BMPs) for any activity,
operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of storm water, the storm water system, or waters of the
Commonwealth. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
water system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs are part of the city BMP manual that is
hereby incorporated by reference as a part of this article. A copy of the BMP
manual is located at city hall, 517 North Main Street. This document may be
viewed or copied at city hall during normal operating hours.

ARTICLE II. STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
DIVISION 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 26-200. Findings of fact.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that:
      (1)   Land development projects and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm
water runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition;
      (2)   This storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants;
      (3)   Storm water runoff, soil erosion and non-point source pollution can
be controlled and minimized through the regulation of storm water runoff from
development sites; and
      (4)   Buffers adjacent to stream systems and coastal areas provide
numerous environmental protection and resource management benefits which can
include: restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological
integrity of the water resources; removing pollutants delivered in urban storm
water; reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation; stabilizing stream
banks; providing infiltration of storm water runoff; maintaining base flow of
streams; contributing the organic matter that is a source of food and energy
for the aquatic ecosystem; providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote
desirable aquatic organisms; providing riparian wildlife habitat; and
furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity.
   (b)   Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity
policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for
the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local water
resources from degradation and to protect and maintain the native vegetation in
riparian and wetland areas. It is determined that the regulation of storm water
runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction
activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff
rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and non-point source
pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public interest and will
prevent threats to public health and safety.
(Ord. No. 589-2006, 5-25-06; Ord. No. 816-2011, 10-3-11)
Sec. 26-201. Purpose.
   The purpose of this article is to establish minimum storm water management
and vegetative buffer requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within
this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the
following objectives:
   (a)   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development in order
to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and stream bank
erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
   (b)   Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by storm water
runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
   (c)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable;
   (d)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-
point source pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety;
   (e)   Establish minimal acceptable requirements for the design of buffers to
protect the streams, wetlands and floodplains of the city; and
   (f)   Protect the water quality of watercourses, reservoirs, lakes, riparian
and aquatic ecosystems, and other significant water resources within this
jurisdiction.

Sec. 26-202. Applicability.
   (a)   This article shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan
applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the
planning commission under the specifications of Division 3 of this article.
This article also applies to land development activities that are smaller than
one (1) acre if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development
that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate
and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on
different schedules. In addition, all plans must also be reviewed by the
planning commission to ensure that established water quality standards will be
maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction
runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans.
   (b)   To prevent the adverse impacts of storm water runoff, the city has
developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development
sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one (1) or
more acre(s) of land. The following activities may be exempt from these storm
water performance criteria:
      (1)   Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an
approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or
approved by the city as applicable.
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing single-family and duplex
structures.
      (3)   Developments that do not disturb more than one (1) acre of land,
provided they are not part of a larger common development plan.
      (4)   Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary by
the city.
   (c)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in section
26-206 of this article, decisions on permitting and on-site storm water
requirements shall be governed by special storm water sizing criteria found in
the most current edition of the best management practices (BMP) manual. These
criteria are dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the
redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all
redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the city.

DIVISION 3. WAIVERS TO STORM WATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS
Sec. 26-230. Waivers for providing storm water management.
   (a)   Every applicant shall provide for storm water management as required
by this article, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement.
Requests to waive the storm water management plan requirements shall be
submitted to the planning commission for approval.
   (b)   The minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived in
whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least
one of the following conditions applies:
      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this article.
      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm
water discharges (such as low impact development, LID) have been established in
a storm water management plan that has been approved by the City of
Nicholasville and the implementation of the plan is required by local
ordinance.
      (3)   Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or greater
than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the
storm water practice.
      (4)   The planning commission finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
      (5)   Non-structural practices will be used on-site that reduce: the
generation of storm water from the site, the size and cost of storm water
storage and the pollutants generated at the site. These non-structural
practices (LID or other) are explained in detail in the most current edition of
the BMP manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices
determined by the planning commission.
   (c)   In instances where one of the conditions in subsection (b) above
applies, the City of Nicholasville may grant a waiver from strict compliance
with these storm water management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation
measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant
must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning commission that the
variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways:
      (1)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
      (2)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
      (3)   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; and
      (4)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, or
property.
   (d)   Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for storm
water management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements
by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the jurisdictional storm
water authority. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of
an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands
should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent
buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat;
      (2)   The creation of a storm water management facility or other drainage
improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that
currently lack storm water management facilities designed and constructed in
accordance with the purposes and standards of this article; and
      (3)   Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund storm water management
activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation
studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates),
stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic
studies), and monitoring of storm water management practices.

   (a)   Where the planning commission waives all or part of the minimum storm
water management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of
adequate storm water facilities provided downstream of the proposed
development, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount as
determined by the planning commission.
   (b)   When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required storm water
management, the monetary contribution required shall be established by the and
based on cost estimate for the cubic feet of storage required for storm water
management of the development in question. All of the monetary contributions
shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and
shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any building and/or
grading permit for the development.

DIVISION 4. GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Sec. 26-240 Storm water criteria.
   Unless judged by the City of Nicholasville to be exempt or granted a waiver,
the following performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water
management at all sites:
   (a)   All site designs shall establish storm water management practices to
control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of storm water. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate
storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
   (b)   Stormwater management measures shall be required that are designed,
built, and maintained to treat, filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen, evapo-
transpire. harvest and reuse stormwater runoff in order to manage stormwater
runoff quality and quantity.
   (c)   Structural and non-structural controls may be used to obtain permanent
stormwater management over the life of the property's use. Structural
stormwater controls include, but are not limited to. grass swales, filter
strips, infiltration basins, detention ponds, stormwater wetlands, natural
filtration areas, sand filters, and rain gardens. Non-structural BMPs include,
but are not limited to. open spaces, vegetated conveyances and buffers, natural
infiltration, and low impact development. See the BMP Manual for additional
information.
   (d)   Areas of development and re-development that result in new or expanded
discharge to high quality waters (HQWs) shall follow the "Standards for
Protection of HQWs" in Nicholasville's Stormwater Manual in order to protect
existing in-stream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to
protect existing uses.
   (e)   New development and redevelopment projects shall not discharge
untreated storm water directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local water
body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact
of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method
acceptable to the planning commission. In no case shall the impact on
functional values be any less than allowed by the army corp of engineers (ACE)
or the staff responsible for natural resources.
   (f)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a storm
water pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under
the provisions of the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES)
general permit. The storm water pollution prevention plan requirement applies
to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (g)   Storm water discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of
specific structural and pollution prevention practices.
   (h)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the planning
commission to determine if they are subject to additional storm water design
requirements.
   (i)   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the BMP manual
shall be used for sizing all storm water management practices.
   (l)   All new development and redevelopment plans shall, at a minimum,
maintain the existing forested buffer along all streams on site.

specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., water quality, two (2) year,
ten (10) year, one hundred (100) year) as identified in the current BMP manual
are met, unless the planning commission grants the applicant a waiver or the
applicant is exempt from such requirements.
   (b)   In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater
control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the planning
commission reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements
deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.

Sec. 26-252. Conveyance issues.
   (a)   All storm water management practices shall be designed to convey storm
water to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow
volumes and velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Maximizing flow paths from inflow points to outflow points;
      (2)   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
      (3)   Elimination of erosive flow velocities; and
      (4)   Providing underdrain systems, where applicable.
   (b)   The BMP manual shall provide detailed guidance on the requirements for
conveyance for each of the approved storm water management practices.
(Ord. No. 589-2006, 5-25-06; Ord. No. 816-2011, 10-3-11)
Sec. 26-253 Pretreatment requirements.
   Every storm water treatment practice shall have an acceptable form of water
quality pretreatment, in accordance with the pretreatment requirements found in
the current BMP manual. Certain storm water treatment practices, as specified
in the BMP manual, are prohibited even with pretreatment in the following
circumstances:
   (a)   Storm water is generated from highly contaminated source areas known
as "hotspots".
   (b)   Storm water is carried in a conveyance system that also carries
contaminated, non-storm water discharges.
   (c)   Storm water is being managed in a designated groundwater recharge
area.
   (d)   Certain geologic conditions exist (e.g., karst) that prohibit the
proper pretreatment of storm water.
(Ord. No. 589-2006, 5-25-06; Ord. No. 816-2011, 10-3-11)
Sec. 26-254. Treatment conditions.
   All storm water management practices shall be designated to capture and
treat storm water runoff according to the specifications outlined in the BMP
manual. Those specifications will designate the water quantity and duality
treatment criteria that apply to an approved storm water management practice.

both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage and
maintain this vegetation.
(Ord. No. 589-2006, 5-25-06; Ord. No. 816-2011, 10-3-11)
Sec. 26-256. Maintenance agreements.
   All storm water treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and
maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This
agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and
inspect the storm water treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance
as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the storm water treatment
practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties
responsible for the proper maintenance of all storm water treatment practices
shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land disturbance
activities.
(Ord. No. 589-2006, 5-25-06; Ord. No. 816-2011, 10-3-11)
Sec. 26-257. Non-structural storm water practices.
   The use of non-structural storm water treatment practices is encouraged in
order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of
reductions in the amount of storm water that must be managed can be earned
through the use of non-structural practices that reduce the generation of storm
water and/or pollutants from the site. These non-structural practices are
explained in BMP manual and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of non-
structural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain
unaltered by subsequent property owners.

section, plus the sales factor, described in subsection (c) of this section,
and the denominator of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the net profits by the sales factor as set forth in
subsection (3) of this section.
   (b)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (c)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.

factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income- producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (d)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;

performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer' s reported percentages under this
subsection, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.

the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,

   (c)   Every business entity subject to a occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
