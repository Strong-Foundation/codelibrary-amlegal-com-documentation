unchanged with respect to an amendment which is repealed at the same meeting of
County Fiscal Court which enacted the amendment.

repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of County Fiscal Court, as long
as the repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the
original amendment.

amendment shall have the effect of reviving the original language of the
repealer or amendment, as the case may be.

arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment
so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance

pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,

   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the County

ordinances conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions bearing the

passage date, the conflict shall be so construed as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
§ 10.16 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer or employee of the county exercising the powers, duties, or
functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.17 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error be discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any word
or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can
be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express the intention, the spelling shall be corrected and
the word or words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the
correct words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration

provide income for employees absent a relatively short time because of personal
illness or injury.
         (b)   Full-time employees shall be eligible to accrue sick leave at
the rate of one day per month accruing at the end of each month for each full
month worked. As an example, a newly hired full- time employee shall accrue
eight hours of sick time on the thirtieth day of his, her or their employment,
which they can use immediately in the preceding month. Part-time, seasonal and
temporary employees are not eligible for sick leave.

days of sick leave without a medical provider’s excuse, but any days over a
three-day period must be accompanied by a medical provider’s ‘return to work’
note unless otherwise authorized by the department head.
      (4)   Unused time. Upon separation from employment by the county for any
reason (i.e., termination, resignation or retirement) employees shall not be
compensated for any unused sick time.
      (5)   Reporting sick leave.
         (a)   To be paid sick leave, the employee has the responsibility to
report his, her or their inability to be on the job. Failure to notify the
supervisor prior to the established work time may result in loss of pay for
that day and may result in disciplinary action against the employee. If
notification is not possible prior to the start of the established work time,
the employee shall notify the supervisor as soon as is possible.
         (b)   Sick leave time used will be subtracted on a hour-for-hour
basis.
         (c)   Upon return to work the employee shall file a notice of leave
form stating the reasons for the absence, unless the employee filed the form
prior to taking sick leave. The form must be approved by the supervisor before
being charged to sick leave. Individual records of all sick leave credit shall
be maintained by the county.
         (d)   The county may require the employee to submit a ‘return to work’
note from a medical provider when the absence occurs before or after a holiday
or other scheduled day off or when an employee has a record of repetitious
usage of short amounts of sick leave over an extended time period. The employee
may be required to take a medical examination on returning from sick leave or
on such occasions that it is in the best interest of the county. The medical
examination shall be given by a physician designated by the county.
         (e)   False or fraudulent use of sick leave shall be cause for
disciplinary action, up to, and including, dismissal.

            1.   Both recipients and donors must be current employees of the
county.
            2.   A donor may not donate an amount of sick leave which would
cause his or her sick leave balance to go below 120 hours.
            3.   An employee becomes eligible to receive donated sick leave at
the point in time when all four of the criteria below are met:
               a.   The employee or member of his or her immediate family
suffers from a “medically certified” illness, injury, impairment or physical or
mental condition which has caused, or is likely to cause, the employee to go on
leave for at least ten consecutive working days;
               b.   The employee’s need for absence is certified by a licensed
practicing physician;
               c.   The employee has exhausted all of his or her available paid
leave: and
               d.   The employee has complied with this policy governing the
use of sick leave.
Participation in the sick leave sharing program is at the discretion of the
employee and requires approval of the County Judge or elected official.
         (b)   Guidelines on sick leave sharing. In the event of a prolonged or
catastrophic illness or injury, or an extended absence due to illness of a
family member, eligible employees who accrue sick leave and who have exhausted
their leave balances may have sick leave donated to them by other eligible
county employees. The forms needed to receive or donate leave may be obtained
from the County Judge’s or the elected official’s office. Listed below is the
chronological flow of actions and documents:
            1.   Recipient completes application and submits it along with the
physician’s certification to the Treasurer. The Treasurer collects all
information, and transmits the appropriate documents to the County Judge or
elected official;
            2.   The application is reviewed to ensure that the certification
of the physician is complete and the form is correctly filled out. The
Treasurer shall verify that the employee will exhaust his or her leave during
the projected absence. The employee does not have to have exhausted his or her
leave before he or she submits the application. The employee also does not have
to have been off for ten days in order to apply, but must have a situation
where it is likely to cause an absence for at least ten consecutive days. A
file will be created for the recipient by the Treasurer. All medical
information must be kept in a locked file separate from the personnel files;
            3.   Donor(s) completes donation form and submits to the Treasurer
or the elected official’s assistant. The Treasurer verifies the donor’s leave
balance for eligibility. After the form is signed by the appointing authority,
the donor’s sick leave balance is reduced by the hours donated;
            4.   Receive and file forms. The Treasurer will stamp all donation
forms with a received date and file the forms in the file for the appropriate
recipient;
            5.   Prepare and process payrolls. Upon certification of
eligibility, all donated leave is to be added to recipient’s sick leave
balance. As the employee utilizes leave for the sick leave sharing qualifying
condition, the employee will be paid as usual, reporting sick leave used;
            6.   Sequence of leave usage. Transfer all leave donated to the
recipient at the time of donation, not on a pay period basis, up to the amount
requested. As the recipient accrues leave, the recipient’s leave time must be
used first. The recipient can then use time donated to him or her. The
recipient uses donated leave in the order in which it is received;
            7.   Recipient can retain leave after return to work. The recipient
may retain the donated leave upon return to work only if the recipient
documents that leave will be needed for continuing treatment relating to the
condition which caused the individual’s absence. For example, if the employee
was absent due to surgery to remove a malignant tumor and returns to work, but
will require periodic absences for radiation therapy, the excess leave may be
retained for that purpose. However, the employee may not retain the excess
leave to be used for any unrelated condition; and
            8.   Sequence of restoring unused leave to donors. When the
recipient returns to work and the donated leave is no longer needed for the
qualifying condition, excess leave shall be returned to donors in reverse order
of donation (last donor’s leave is returned first). If the donor has left
employment, the returned hours should be credited to the inactive record for
restoration if the employee is rehired.
   (D)   Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
      (1)   General. FMLA, being 29 U.S.C. §§ 2611 et seq., provides
entitlement for up to 12 weeks of job protected, unpaid leave, during any 12-
month period for the following reasons:
         (a)   The birth of a son/daughter or care for newborn child;
         (b)   The placement of a son/daughter for adoption or foster care;
         (c)   Care for the employee’s spouse, son/daughter or parent with a
serious health condition; and
         (d)   The employee’s own serious health condition.
      (2)   Qualifying exigency leave. The FMLA requires that employers provide
employees up to 12 weeks of leave in a 12-month period to tend to any
“exigency” resulting from a service member’s call to duty. The new FMLA
regulations clarify that exigency leave may be taken by eligible employees
(consisting of not only a spouse, son, daughter or parent, but also “next of
kin” - the next nearest blood relative) while their spouse, son, daughter or
parent is on active duty or call to active duty status in the National Guard or
Reserves, or if the family member is a retired member of the regular Armed
Forces or the Reserves. An employee whose family member is on active duty or
call to active duty for the regular Armed Forces does not qualify for this
leave. Qualifying exigencies include short-notice deployment, military events
and related activities, childcare and school activities, financial and legal
arrangements, counseling, rest and recuperation, post-deployment activities and
additional activities.
      (3)   Military caregiver leave. An eligible employee is entitled to 26
work weeks of leave in a 12-month period to care for a covered service member
in the Armed Forces (including the National Guard and Reserves) who becomes ill
or injured as a result of his or her military service. The 12-month period
begins when the employee starts using her or his leave. This leave may only be
taken once per injury, but may be taken again if there are additional injuries.
More than one family member may qualify for the leave.
      (4)   Maintenance of benefits. If the employee was qualified for health
insurance benefits when leave begins, the employer shall maintain health
benefits for the employee in the same manner during periods of FMLA leave as if
the employee continued to work.
      (5)   Unused sick leave. However, the employee must exhaust all
accumulated sick leave and annual leave time prior to receiving unpaid FMLA
leave.
      (6)   Employee contribution. Upon employee being granted FMLA leave, the
employee must continue to pay his or her own employee contribution to the
health insurance plan ordinarily required of an employee. The employer will
continue to pay the contribution ordinarily paid by the employer under the
current health insurance plan. If the employee contribution payment is not paid
by the employee, in such event, the employer may terminate the health insurance
benefits of the employee during FMLA leave. However, the employee may exercise
his, her or their rights for COBRA benefits.
      (7)   Commencement of benefits. In order to qualify for FMLA benefits,
the employee must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months prior to
the commencement of benefits and worked at least 1,250 hours in the prior year.
The 12-month period need not be consecutive. Employment prior to a break in
service of more than seven years need not be counted unless the break in
service was occasioned by the fulfillment of National Guard or Reserve military
service obligations.
      (8)   Entitlement. Upon the employer granting FMLA leave, the employee
receives an entitlement of up to 12 weeks of job protected unpaid leave during
any 12-month period. The fixed 12 month “leave year” shall commence January 1
of each year and conclude on December 31 of each year.
      (9)   Written notice. When the need for leave is foreseeable, the
employee must give the employer at least 30 days’ written notice of his or her
intent to receive FMLA leave benefits. If the leave is not foreseeable, the
employee must provide written notice as soon as possible. The employer reserves
the right to require medical certification of a serious health condition for
the employee’s health or a member of his or her family, as defined herein. The
employer may also require periodic written medical reports during the leave of
the employee’s health status, health status of his or her family as defined
herein, as well as “fitness-for-duty” certification upon return to work from a
health care provider.
      (10)   Definition. SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION means an illness, impairment,
injury or physical/mental condition that involves either:
         (a)   Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient
care in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, and any
period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with such impatient
care; or
         (b)   Continuing treatment by a health care provider which includes
any period of incapacity that prevents the employee or family member from
working, attending school or any other regular daily activity.
      (11)   Donated sick leave. Any employee desiring to benefit from “donated
sick leave” must be granted same and utilize same prior to applying for leave
without pay under FMLA. Upon FMLA leave being granted to the employee, the
employee may not participate in the donated sick leave plan until the employee
has returned to work on a regular paid basis with a letter from a health care
provider stating that the employee is fit for duty.
      (12)   Authorization. Upon the employer granting leave without pay under
FMLA, as provided for herein, the County Judge or elected official shall
authorize same in writing and provide the employee and the county treasurer a
copy of the written approval. All applications for leave without pay and all
approvals of same, not in writing, shall disqualify the employee from health
benefits otherwise provided herein.
   (E)   Funeral (bereavement) leave.
      (1)   When an employee’s immediate family member dies, the Fiscal Court
allows up to three days off with pay. IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER, as defined for
bereavement, is defined as parents, grandparents, spouse, brothers, sisters,
children, grandchildren, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, parent or step-parent of
spouse, step-parent, step-child, foster parent or foster child.
      (2)   When an employee’s extended family member dies, the Fiscal Court
allows up to eight hours off with pay for the day of the funeral. If the
funeral service falls on a weekend or holiday, the employee shall be allowed to
take the eight hours off with pay on the day preceding or the day following the
weekend or holiday. No additional compensation will be provided if the employee
does not take the funeral (bereavement) leave. EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER is
defined as brother-in-law, sister-in-law, niece, nephew, grandparent of spouse,
great grandparent or aunt or uncle of employee or employee’s spouse.
      (3)   In the event an employee desires to extend leave beyond the days
set out above due to a death in the immediate or extended family, the employee
may use sick leave, vacation leave or time without pay upon receiving approval
from the Judge-Executive.
      (4)   Supervisors should immediately notify the Judge-Executive when one
of the employees in his or her department has a death in their family. The
Fiscal Court will send a bereavement gift not to exceed $75 when an employee’s
immediate family member passes away. This condolence will be sent through the
Fiscal Court secretary’s office and not through the individual department.
   (F)   Leave without pay.
      (1)   In addition to authorized leave referenced above, the County Judge
or elected official may authorize an employee to be absent, without pay, for
personal reasons.
      (2)   Leave of absence without pay will not be granted until all vacation
leave has been exhausted.
      (3)   Request for leave for personal reasons shall be submitted in
writing to the County Judge or elected official, stating reasons for the

for a period not to exceed six weeks. Additional leave time may be granted.
      (2)   An employee granted maternity leave or paternity leave shall use
any accrued sick leave and vacation time with the remaining periods as time off
without pay.
      (3)   The employee must notify the County Judge or elected official as
far as possible in advance of the employee’s intention to request maternity
leave or paternity leave, including approximate dates, in order to allow the
County Judge or elected official time to prepare for any staff adjustments.
   (H)   Military leave. Pursuant to KRS 61.394 and 61.396, all employees of
the county, or of any department or agency thereof, who are members of the
National Guard or of any reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United
States, or of the reserve corps of the United States Public Health Service,
shall be entitled to leave of absence from their respective duties, without
loss of time, pay, regular leave, impairment of efficiency rating, or of any
other rights or benefits to which they are entitled, while in the performance
of duty or training in the service of the state or of the United States under
competent orders as specified in this section. In any one federal fiscal year,
officers or employees, while on military leave, shall be paid their salaries or
compensations for a period or periods not exceeding 21 calendar days. Any

appearance, the employee shall make arrangements with the employee’s supervisor
to comply with the order.
   (B)   If appearing in an official capacity in connection with the county,
the employee’s court time is considered working time and no charge is made
against leave time.
   (C)   If the employee is involved in a personal case, either as plaintiff,
defendant or as a witness in a suit not resulting from his or her duties with
the county, he or she may be granted leave, but the time off he or she takes

§ 30.090 OVERTIME AND COMPENSATION.
   (A)   The county’s work week begins Sunday and concludes on Saturday.
   (B)   Overtime will be authorized by documented approval by the Judge-
Executive. The supervisor or office holder shall not require overtime of their
employees, except in extraordinary situations. When emergency conditions such
as snow, storms or flooding exist in the county and the County Road Department
Supervisor and the County Judge Executive decide to work during these emergency
conditions, the County Road Department employees working during these
conditions will be considered as having worked overtime hours. These employees
are not required to work 40 hours in any work week to be eligible for such
emergency overtime hours.
   (C)   (1)   The salary of supervisors is “preadjusted” to anticipate
“overtime compensation during times of extraordinary or emergency situations
such as snow removal, storms and things of a similar nature. Therefore,
supervisors shall not be entitled to “overtime compensation” in addition to
their regular salary.
      (2)   A county employee who is authorized to work one or more hours in
excess of the prescribed hours per week may be granted compensatory leave on an
hour-for-hour basis. Upon the written request by a county employee, made freely
and without coercion, pressure or suggestion by the employer, and upon a
written agreement reached between the employer and the county employee before
the performance of the work, a county employee who is not exempt from the
provisions of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq.,
may be granted compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay, at the rate of not
less than one and one-half hours for each hour the county employee is
authorized to work in excess of 40 hours in a work week.
      (3)   As of 7-26-2019, a county employee engaged in work in excess of 37
and one-half hours, may accrue not more than 80 hours of compensatory time. A
county employee who has accrued 80 hours of compensatory time off, shall for
additional overtime hours of work, be paid overtime compensation.
      (4)   A county employee who has accrued compensatory time off, and who
has requested the use of compensatory time, shall be permitted to use the
compensatory time within a reasonable period after making the request if the
use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
county. Mere inconvenience to the county shall not constitute a sufficient
basis for denial of a county employee’s request for compensatory time off. No
salaried employee is eligible for comp time.
      (5)   Upon a county employee’s termination of employment, all unused
accrued compensatory time shall be paid at a rate of compensation not less
than:
         (a)   The average regular rate received by the county employee during
the last three years of the county employee’s employment; or
         (b)   The final regular rate received by the county, whichever is
higher.

lettterhead. In the event that a second violation occurs, the volunteer will
then lose all rights and access to county vehicles.
         (c)   Employees and volunteers must use due diligence to drive safely
and to maintain the security of the vehicle and its contents. Employees and
volunteers are also responsible for any driving infractions or fines as a
result of the driving.

malicious damage involving their county vehicle to their department head and
the Judge Executive, regardless of the extent of damage or lack of inquiries.

      (4)   Note: should any portion of this policy dealing with the actual
administration of this policy be amended, employees shall be provided with
copies of any administrative change or modification and given an opportunity to
ask questions and obtain answers regarding any administrative change(s) in this
policy. However, changes may not be made to the policy that would circumvent
any requirements associated with 803 KAR 25:280.
      (5)   (a)   The county currently utilizes Ensite Laboratory as its
laboratory of choice for the collection of urine samples in the case of testing
for controlled substances, and for the administration of breathalyzer tests for
alcohol concentration. Ensite Laboratory is also the Court’s third-party
administrator of choice for the random selection category of testing. Employees
are selected by Ensite Laboratory using a statistically valid method of
selection of specific employee codes. This random testing will be reasonably
spaced over a 12-month period. Because of the random nature of the selection
process, any employee may be tested more than once, or not at all. Once
collected, all urine samples are forwarded for analysis to Ensite Laboratory,
which is a laboratory approved by the National Laboratory Certification Program
(NLCP) under the United States Department of Health and Mental Services
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
         (b)   The county shall administer alcohol and drug tests in
circumstances which include, but may not be limited to, the following.
            1.   Pre-employment testing.
               a.   Breath alcohol and urine drug testing shall be required of
all new hire applicants after their receipt of a conditional offer of
employment. After receiving the conditional offer of employment, applicants
will have 24 hours in which to submit to testing at a testing facility of CFC’s
choosing. The CFC requires that every newly hired employee test free of
controlled substances and have a breath alcohol concentration of not more than
0.00. Each offer of employment by CFC shall be conditional upon the passing of
controlled substance and alcohol tests.
               b.   Refusal by any applicant for employment with CFC to take
the controlled substance test will result in the conditional offer of
employment being withdrawn. All testing under this policy will be in accordance
with testing protocols described elsewhere in this policy.
               c.   An applicant with a confirmed positive test for controlled
substances and/or breath alcohol in a concentration of or greater than 0.00
which is not legitimately explained to and accepted by a medical review
officer, will not be considered for employment.
               d.   Any applicant who fails a controlled substance or breath
alcohol test may not be considered for future employment with CFC.
               e.   Any applicant who refuses to take a controlled substance or
breath alcohol test will be disqualified from future consideration for
employment.
               f.   Any applicant who tampers with, or attempts to tamper with,
a urine specimen in any manner shall be disqualified from current and future
consideration of employment with the CFC.
               g.   An applicant whose positive test is confirmed and upheld by
the medical review officer (MRO) may request that the same sample be retested
at her or his own expense at a CFC approved laboratory.
               h.   Individuals undergoing pre-employment testing shall not
begin official employment with the CFC until after all test results are
received and shown to be negative. Upon receipt of the test result, positive or
negative, the County Judge Executive or his or her designee shall inform the
appropriate department head of the results.
            2.   Random testing.
               a.   Employees in a safety sensitive position will be required
to participate in a statistically valid, unannounced random selection process,
which will subject them to mandatory drug and/or alcohol testing. This category
of testing will conduct random tests for alcohol at a rate of no more than 10%
for non-federally regulated Safety Sensitive positions. Employees holding
positions in which a commercial driver’s license (CDL) is required, must also
be tested at a minimum rate of 10% for alcohol annually to satisfy Department
of Transportation (DOT) requirements. In the ease of random testing for drug
use, non-federally regulated safety sensitive positions will be tested at a
rate of no more than 10%. Employees holding positions in which a CDL is
required, must be tested for drugs at a rate 50% annually to satisfy DOT
requirements. All employees in federally regulated safety sensitive positions
shall be selected from a pool that is separate from the random selection pool
for other non-federally regulated safety sensitive positions. The County Judge
Executive shall utilize a third party to conduct the random selection of safety
sensitive employees, including employees holding a CDL, to be tested. This
random testing shall be unannounced and will take place throughout each
calendar year. Safety sensitive employees are selected by a third party
administrator using a statistically valid, random method of selection using
specific employee codes. Because of the random nature of this testing process,
safety sensitive employees may be selected for testing more than once or not at
all. Once an employee is notified that he or she has been selected for testing,
the employee must proceed immediately to the testing site of CFC’s choosing.
               b.   Note: employees in non-safety sensitive positions will not
be included in the random selection pool. However, non-safety sensitive
employees will be subject to testing for other reasons. Procedures and
protocols for “reasonable suspicion”, “post accident”, “return-to-duty” and
“follow-up” testing all of which testing types are described elsewhere in this
policy will apply in their case.
            3.   Reasonable suspicion testing.
               a.   A reasonable suspicion test shall be based on a belief that
an employee is using or has used drugs or alcohol in violation of this policy,
drawn from specific objective facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those
facts in light of experience, training or education. The reasonable suspicion
testing shall be based upon:
                  i.   While at work, direct observation of drug or alcohol use
or of the physical symptoms or manifestations of being under the influence of a
drug or alcohol;
                  ii.   While at work, abnormal conduct, erratic behavior or a
significant deterioration in work performance;
                  iii.   A report of drug or alcohol use provided by a reliable
and credible source;
                  iv.   Evidence that an individual has tampered with a drug or
alcohol test during employment with the CFC;
                  v.   Information that an employee has caused, contributed to
or been involved in an accident while at work;
                  vi.   Evidence that an employee has used, possessed, sold,
solicited or transferred illegal or illicit drugs or used alcohol while on
CFC’s premises or while operating CFC’s vehicle, machinery or equipment.
               b.   The County Judge Executive or his or her designee shall be
notified immediately of any indication of reasonable suspicion. Both the
observing department supervisor and the County Judge Executive or his or her
representative will review the policies and procedures herein and if necessary
make arrangements with a testing facility of CFC’s choosing to conduct
reasonable suspicion drug and/or alcohol testing as soon as possible. If a
representative from the office of the County Judge Executive is not available,
the observing supervisor shall obtain the assistance of another CFC supervisor
or other credible and reliable source and together they shall complete the
reasonable suspicion form, and forward it to the County Judge Executive. If
after completing the form, it is determined that there is in fact, reasonable
suspicion that the employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, the
observing supervisor or his or her designee will notify the employee and
accompany him or her to the testing site.
               c.   When a reasonable suspicion test is ordered, the employee
must submit to testing within 45 minutes of being notified that he or she will
be tested. The observing supervisor and/or designee shall remain at the testing
site with the employee being tested, until the collection process is completed.
Any employee who is tested for reasonable suspicion shall be placed on leave
with pay until the results of the test are known. After submitting to the drug/
alcohol test, the employee may not return to work until the results of the test
are known and only then if the results are negative. Only the County Judge
Executive or his or her authorized designee may order a reasonable suspicion
test.
            4.   Post-accident testing.
               a.   Drug and alcohol testing will be conducted following an
employee’s involvement in an accident in which property damage occurs, on or
off CFC’s premises while on duty, or in the course of employment for CFC, or
which requires off-site medical attention be administered to a person.
               b.   Qualifying event exception: due to varying types of
accident cause, all accidents categorized as a “qualifying event” may not
require post-accident testing. Exceptions to the “qualifying event” for
requiring post-accident drug and alcohol testing will include, but may not be
limited to, the following types of accidents:
                  i.   Injuries whose onset is cumulative or gradual - such as
carpel tunnel syndrome, progressive hearing loss, mental disorders, dermatitis,
respiratory diseases, skin disorders and the like;
                  ii.   Injuries where the employee can be completely
discounted as the contributing factor (i.e., injuries caused by a third party
or some other uncontrollable force or event such as weather, insects, toxic
plants and the like); and
                  iii.   Injuries where the employee can be completely
discounted as the major contributing factor or those injuries occurring during
physical fitness or a training event, in which the employee did everything
within reason to avoid the injury accident, (i.e., was performing training as
instructed).
               c.   In each case, the County Judge Executive or his or her
designee shall determine the necessity of drug and alcohol testing and shall
communicate such testing with the involved employee and the employee’s
respective department head. The County Judge Executive or his or her designee
shall coordinate all required tests with the appropriate medical facilities.
               d.   An employee involved in an accident while on an out-of-town
assignment, shall notify their department director or the director’s designee
as soon as possible but no later than two hours after the accident occurred.
The department director shall notify the County Judge Executive or her or his
designee to discuss possible drug/alcohol testing requirements.
               e.   Other qualifying event: the department director or his or
her designee shall request controlled substance/breath alcohol testing when an
employee caused or cannot be completely discounted from causing a vehicular or
any other type of accident in which death, serious bodily injury or major
property damage did result or could have resulted. If a post-accident
controlled substance/breath alcohol test is required, a confirmed positive test
result will result in the employee’s immediate termination.
            5.   Return-to-duty testing.
               a.   The County Fiscal Court maintains a “no tolerance” policy
for drugs and/or alcohol.
               b.   “No tolerance” means that once you are selected for a drug
or alcohol test, should your test be positive, without a valid medical or bio-
medical reason as confirmed by a medical review officer, you will be
immediately terminated from your employment with CFC.
               c.   Only in circumstances in which the employee voluntarily
elects to seek assistance for a substance abuse problem through the employee
assistance program prior to being selected for a test, completes whatever form
of treatment a substance abuse professional recommends and is willing to sign a
return to work/treatment plan agreement, will CFC consider allowing the
employee to return to work after treatment is successfully completed as
confirmed by a substance abuse professional.
               d.   In all cases, it shall be at the discretion of the CFC,
subject to all applicable laws and regulations, as to whether to allow an
employee to return to work. In the event that an employee who has voluntarily
sought assistance, prior to being selected for a controlled substance or breath
alcohol test is allowed to enter a controlled substance/alcohol abuse
rehabilitation program, the employee may be allowed to return to work only
under the following circumstances.
                  i.   The employee may resume regular duties only after the
employee tests negative in an alcohol and/or controlled substance test
administered by the CFC-approved laboratory and can provide a release to return
to work from an appropriate substance abuse treatment facility or confirmation
of continued and on-going participation in a CFC recognized substance abuse
assistance program. An employee must test negative within a reasonable period
of time from receipt of the initial test results not to exceed 45 days. Any
repeat occurrence of substance abuse or violation of any other aspect of the
CFC’s drug free workplace policy will result in immediate termination.
                  ii.   Prior to returning to work, the employee shall be
required to meet with the County Judge Executive or his or her authorized
designee to receive an explanation of the terms of continued employment; and to
sign a written return-to- work/treatment plan agreement, detailing the terms
under which the employee will be allowed to return to work. Such agreement
shall stipulate that the employee, at the Court’s request, may be required at
any time, to submit to interviews and/or evaluation by the professional staff
at an appropriate chemical dependency treatment facility approved by the CFC’s
employee assistance program (EAP). The return-to-work agreement will also
stipulate that the employee be required to submit to unannounced controlled
substance and/or alcohol testing for up to 12 months after resuming duties.
            6.   Follow-up testing. Any employee returning to work from
successful completion of an employee assistance program for drug- and/or
alcohol-related problems, or a drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation program,
shall be required to undergo one year of quarterly drug and alcohol testing.
The frequency of the follow-up testing shall consider recommendations of any
involved substance abuse professional (SAP) but shall be not less than once per
quarter (every three months) for at least one year. All follow-up testing may
be requested at any time and shall be unannounced.
   (B)   Testing protocol.
      (1)   The collection of samples and administration or drug and alcohol
tests shall follow all standards, procedures and protocols set forth by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Administration (SAMHSA). Test results will be obtained by a qualified
laboratory, as defined elsewhere in this policy, and results shall undergo a
medical review as follows.
         (a)   All test results shall be submitted for medical review by a
medical review officer (MRO) of the county’s choosing, who shall consider the
medical history of the employee or applicant, as well as relevant biomedical
information.
         (b)   If there is a positive test result, the employee or applicant
will be given an opportunity to report to the MRO the use of any prescription
or over-the-counter medication.
         (c)   If the MRO determines that there is a legitimate medical
explanation for a positive test result, the MRO may certify that the test
results do not indicate the unauthorized use of alcohol or a controlled
substance.
         (d)   If the MRO determines, after appropriate review, that there is
not a medical explanation for the positive test result other than the
unauthorized use of alcohol or a prohibited drug, the MRO shall refer the
individual tested to the County Judge Executive or his or her authorized
representative for further proceedings in accordance with CFC’s drug-free
workplace policy.
      (2)   Note: MRO determinations concerning the use of alcohol or a
controlled or illicit substance shall comply with all procedures outlined in
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (SAMHSA) Medical Review
Officer Manual for Federal Drug Testing Programs.
   (C)   Testing process.
      (1)   Employees shall report to the collection site of CFC’s choosing
immediately after being provided the notification to test. In the case of
reasonable suspicion testing, a supervisor or designee shall escort the
employee to the collection site. Drug testing will be conducted by urine sample
while alcohol testing will be analyzed using a breath alcohol testing/screening
device. Drug and alcohol analysis will be performed by a trained technician.
      (2)   To ensure that the test specimen is actually that of the donor,
collection site staff will require positive identification of the test subject.
      (3)   To ensure the accuracy and fairness of our testing program, all
testing will be conducted according to Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA) guidelines where applicable and will include a
screening test; a confirmation test; the opportunity for a split sample; review
by a medical review officer, including the opportunity for employees who test
positive to provide a legitimate medical explanation, such as a physician’s
prescription, for the positive result; and a documented chain of custody.
      (4)   All drug-testing information will be maintained in separate
confidential records.
      (5)   The County Fiscal Court shall require all tests for alcohol to be
performed by a certified breath alcohol technician (BAT). An 11-panel urine
test will be conducted and shall include analysis for the following substances:
         (a)   Amphetamines;
         (b)   Cannabinoids (THC);
         (c)   Cocaine;
         (d)   Opiates;
         (e)   Phencyclidine (PCP);
         (f)   Benzodiazepines;
         (g)   Propoxyphene;
         (h)   Methaqualone;
         (i)   Methadone;
         (j)   Barbiturates; and
         (k)   Synthetic Narcotics.
      (6)   Each employee, as a condition of employment, will be required to
participate in pre- employment, random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion,
return-to-duty and follow-up testing upon selection or request of management.
      (7)   Any employee who tests positive will be immediately removed from
duty, referred to a substance abuse professional for assessment and
recommendations, required to pass a return-to-duty test and sign a return-to-
work agreement, subject to ongoing, unannounced, follow-up testing for a period
of five years and terminated immediately if he or she tests positive a second
time or violates the return-to-work agreement.
      (8)   An employee will be subject to the immediate termination of
employment if he or she refuses the screening or the test, adulterates or
dilutes the specimen, substitutes the specimen with that from another person or
sends an imposter, fails or declines to take a second drug test when directed,
will not sign the required forms or refuses to cooperate in the testing process
in such a way that prevents completion of the test.
(Ord. 21.230-1, passed 7-8-2021)
§ 30.120 PROHIBITED BEHAVIOR.
   (A)   It is a violation of the drug-free workplace policy to use, possess,
sell, trade and/or offer for sale alcohol, illegal drugs or intoxicants.
   (B)   Prescription and over-the-counter drugs are not prohibited when taken
in standard dosage and/or according to a physician’s prescription. Any employee
taking prescribed or over-the-counter medications will be responsible for
consulting the prescribing physician and/or pharmacist to ascertain whether the
medication may interfere with safe performance of his or her job. If the use of
a medication could compromise the safety of the employee, fellow employees or
the public, it is the employee’s responsibility to use appropriate personnel
procedures (e.g., call in sick, use leave, request change of duty, notify
supervisor, notify company doctor) to avoid unsafe workplace practices.
   (C)   The illegal or unauthorized use of prescription drugs is prohibited.
It is a violation of the CFC’s drug-free workplace policy to intentionally
misuse and/or abuse prescription medications. Appropriate disciplinary action
will be taken if job performance deterioration and/or other accidents occur.
   (D)   The County Fiscal Court reserves the right to define and interpret
prohibited activities that specifically include, but may not be limited to:
      (1)   Alcohol.
         (a)   Prohibited conduct involving the use of alcohol includes the
following:
            1.   The performance of or being immediately available to perform
work duties while having an alcohol concentration greater than 0.00;
            2.   The consumption of alcohol or products containing alcohol
during the performance of or being immediately available to perform work
responsibilities;
            3.   In the case of safety sensitive employees, containing alcohol
during the performance of or being immediately able to perform safety sensitive
work responsibilities. This includes the possession of medicines containing
alcohol (prescription or over-the-counter) unless the seal is unbroken and/or
the medication is prescribed by a licensed physician, and said physician has
confirmed the necessity of the safety sensitive employees’ said possession of
the prescribed substance containing alcohol and has confirmed that the use of
such substance will not deter from the employees ability to safely perform
assigned safety sensitive responsibilities. In the latter case, a prescription
drug notification form must be on file with the County Judge Executive;
            4.   The performance of, or being immediately available to perform
those responsibilities designated as safety sensitive, within four hours after
using alcohol;
            5.   The transportation and/or possession of alcoholic beverages
(open or closed containers) within CFC-owned vehicles or equipment. Note: law
enforcement personnel functioning within the scope of their assigned duties
shall be considered exempt from this prohibition as deemed necessary by their
respective department head(s);
            6.   The use of alcohol for eight hours immediately following an
accident requiring a post-accident alcohol test or until a post-accident test
is administered, whichever occurs first;
            7.   Refusal to submit or cooperate with any of the required
testing types; and
            8.   The operation of a CFC-owned vehicle following consumption of
alcoholic beverages shall be considered a violation of this policy and shall
result in disciplinary action.
         (b)   Note: employees attending training programs and/or conferences
related to their employment with CFC may participate in social functions
associated with the program or conference. If alcoholic beverages are present
at the social function and the employee chooses to engage in consumption of
said beverage(s), he, she or they shall do so at his, her or their own
discretion. Employees who choose to engage in the consumption of alcoholic
beverages as part of a work related social function shall do so in a
responsible manner, maintaining a conduct that would not reflect adversely upon
the CFC. Any unbecoming conduct by an employee who has chosen to consume
alcohol at such conference or training program that has an adverse effect upon
the CFC will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination
of employment.
         (c)   Note: alcohol includes any intoxicating agent in beverage
alcohol, methyl and isopropyl alcohol whether used for medicinal purposes or
not. Many over-the-counter and prescription medications contain high
percentages of alcohol.
      (2)   Notification of convictions. Employees are hereby notified that
they shall inform the County Judge Executive or his or her authorized designee,
of any criminal charge or conviction within five days of said charge or
conviction. The County Judge Executive shall take appropriate action within 30
days.
      (3)   Drugs or controlled substances. Prohibited conduct involving the
use of drugs or controlled substances includes, but may not be limited to, the
following:
         (a)   1.   Prescription and over-the-counter drugs are not prohibited
when taken in standard dosage and/or according to a physician’s prescription.
However, any safety sensitive employee taking prescribed or over-the-counter
medications will, in all cases, be responsible for consulting the prescribing
physician and/or pharmacist to ascertain whether the medication may interfere
with the safe performance of his or her safety sensitive job duties. Prior to
initiating usage after such medications are prescribed, the safety sensitive
employee shall submit a prescription drug notification form to his, her or
their immediate supervisor who shall, in turn, submit it to the County Judge
Executive or his or her designee as soon as possible.
            2.   After receiving such form, the County Judge Executive or his
or her authorized designee may request written medical authorization showing
the safety sensitive employee may possess/use such medication, that it was used
in the prescribed manner and showing the safety sensitive employee is fit to
safely perform safety sensitive assigned duties. If the use of such medication
could compromise the safety of the safety sensitive employee, fellow employees,
or the public at large, it is the safety sensitive employee’s responsibility to
use appropriate personnel procedures (e.g., call in sick, use leave, request
change of duty and notify his or her supervisor) to avoid unsafe workplace
practices. No prescription drugs shall be brought onto CFC property, or
consumed on Court property by anyone other than the individual for whom the
drugs have been prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner. The illegal or
unauthorized use of prescription drugs is strictly prohibited. It is a
violation of the CFC’s drug-free workplace policy to intentionally misuse and/
or abuse prescription medications.
            3.   Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken if job
performance deterioration and/or other accidents occur as the result of the
intentional misuse and/or abuse of prescription medication.
            4.   The CFC reserves the right to have a designated physician of
its choosing to determine if a prescription drug or medication produces effects
that would be considered unacceptable in the performance of assigned safety
sensitive work duties. The designated physician has final determination on
whether the medication will have or is having an unacceptable effect on the
safety sensitive employee’s performance of duties. In such instances of
temporary impediment to safe performance of regular safety sensitive duties,
the safety sensitive employee may be temporarily reassigned to duties requiring
a lesser safety awareness level if such duties are available.
            5.   All doctor’s statements and related medical information shall
be confidential and maintained in a separate medical file in the office of the
County Judge Executive.
         (b)   Testing positive for any of the prohibited substances during the
performance of or upon being immediately available to perform work
responsibilities;
         (c)   The performance of or being immediately available to perform
safety sensitive work responsibilities while using any controlled substance,
except when the use is under the instructions of a physician who has advised
that the use will not adversely affect the safety sensitive user’s ability to
safely perform safety sensitive responsibilities as assigned;
         (d)   1.   In the case of safety sensitive employees, having in
possession, drugs or controlled substances, except when the use is under the
instructions of a physician who has advised that the use will not adversely
affect the safety sensitive user’s ability to safely perform safety sensitive
responsibilities as assigned during the performance of or being immediately
available to perform safety sensitive work responsibilities.
            2.   Note: EMS and law enforcement personnel functioning within the
scope of their assigned duties shall be considered exempt from this prohibition
as deemed necessary by their respective department heads.
         (e)   Refusal (as defined elsewhere in this policy) to cooperate with
any of the requested testing types;
         (f)   Tampering with or attempting to alter, or actual altering of a
test specimen is strictly prohibited and is grounds for immediate termination
from employment with the CFC;
      (4)   Volatile substances. The intentional misuse, manufacture, sale,
distribution, dispensation or possession of a volatile substance as defined in
KRS 217.900 which includes any glue, cement, paint or other substance
containing a solvent or chemical having the property of releasing toxic vapors
or fumes which when intentionally inhaled may cause a condition of
intoxication, inebriation, stupefaction, dulling of the brain or nervous
system, or distortion or disturbance of auditory, visual or mental processes
while al work, while on CFC property, or while conducting CFC business while
off CFC property, is strictly prohibited and is considered cause for immediate
discipline, up to and including termination.
(Ord. 21.230-1, passed 7-8-2021)
§ 30.121 CONSEQUENCES.
   (A)   One of the goals of our drug-free workplace program is to encourage
employees to voluntarily seek help with alcohol and/or drug problems. If,
however, an individual violates the policy, the consequences are serious.
   (B)   In the case of applicants, if he or she violates the drug-free
workplace policy, the offer of employment can be withdrawn. The applicant may
reapply after six months and must successfully pass a pre-employment drug test.
   (C)   If an employee violates the policy, he or she will be subject to
progressive disciplinary action up to immediate termination of employment and
may be required to enter rehabilitation. An employee required to enter
rehabilitation who fails to successfully complete it and/or repeatedly violates
the policy will be terminated from employment. Nothing in this policy prohibits
the employee from being disciplined or discharged for other violations and/or
performance problems.
(Ord. 21.230-1, passed 7-8-2021)
§ 30.122 RETURN-TO-WORK AGREEMENTS.
   Following a violation of the drug-free workplace policy, an employee may be
offered an opportunity to participate in rehabilitation. In such cases, the
employee must sign and abide by the terms set forth in a return-to-work
agreement as a condition of continued employment.
(Ord. 21.230-1, passed 7-8-2021)
§ 30.123 ASSISTANCE.
   (A)   Alcohol and drug abuse and addiction are recognized as diseases
responsive to proper treatment. The CFC provides a level of care through its
employee assistance program (EAP) provided. It also realizes that early
intervention and support improve the success of rehabilitation. To support the
employees, the CFC’s drug-free workplace policy:
      (1)   Encourages employees to seek help if they are concerned that they
or their family members may have a drug and/or alcohol problem; and
      (2)   Encourages employees to utilize the services of qualified
professionals in the community to assess the seriousness of suspected drug or
alcohol problems and identify appropriate sources of help.
Treatment for alcoholism and/or other drug use disorders may be covered by the
employee benefit plan. However, the ultimate financial responsibility for
recommended treatment belongs to the employee.
   (B)   Employees who voluntarily report a substance abuse problem prior to
being required to take a controlled substance or alcohol test as defined in
this policy, will not be subject to disciplinary action if they voluntarily and
conscientiously seek substance abuse assistance and agree to a treatment plan,
However, such an employee must understand that if the problem is not corrected
and satisfactory job performance is not maintained, he or she will be subject
to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Failure
to seek such assistance, or failure to abide by the terms of the treatment
plan, shall be grounds for termination. Upon voluntarily reporting a substance
abuse problem, the employee will be required to sign a substance abuse
treatment plan return-to-work agreement form that will further define
conditions of continued employment.
(Ord. 21.230-1, passed 7-8-2021)
§ 30.124 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)   All information received by the CFC through the drug-free workplace
program is confidential communication. Access to this information is limited to
those who have a legitimate need to know in compliance with relevant laws and
management policies.
   (B)   (1)   The CFC shall maintain records and documents of all alcohol and
drug test results, schedules for follow-up tests and records relating to
evaluation and referrals. These records shall be maintained for a period of at
least five years.
      (2)   The CFC shall provide test result information or other pertinent
information relating to an applicant or existing employee’s alcohol or
controlled substance tests upon the applicant or existing employee’s written
request, and shall do so within five working days of being notified of the
request.
(Ord. 21.230-1, passed 7-8-2021)
§ 30.125 POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   It shall be the responsibility of the County Judge Executive to administer
and enforce this policy. This policy and its programs are not to be interpreted
or modified by any other Court supervisor or director.
(Ord. 21.230-1, passed 7-8-2021)
§ 30.126 RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   While it is ultimately the CFC’s legal, ethical and moral
responsibility to create and maintain a safe and productive drug-free workplace
for its employees, and the citizens of county, such safety is achieved through
cooperation and shared responsibility. Both employees and management have
important roles to play.
   (B)   All employees are required to not report to work or be subject to duty
while their ability to perform job duties is impaired due to on- or off-duty
use of alcohol or other drugs.
   (C)   In addition, employees are encouraged to:
      (1)   Be concerned about working in a safe environment; and
      (2)   Report dangerous behavior to their supervisor.
   (D)   It is the supervisor’s responsibility to:
      (1)   Inform employees of the drug-free workplace policy;
      (2)   Observe employee performance;
      (3)   Investigate reports of dangerous practices;
      (4)   Document negative changes and problems in performance;
      (5)   Counsel employees as to expected performance improvement; and
      (6)   Clearly state consequences of policy violations.
(Ord. 21.230-1, passed 7-8-2021)
§ 30.127 COMMUNICATION.
   (A)   Communicating the drug-free workplace policy to both supervisors and
employees is critical to its success. To ensure all employees are aware of
their role in supporting the CFC’s drug-free workplace program:
      (1)   All employees will receive a written copy of the policy;
      (2)   The policy will be reviewed in orientation sessions with new
employees;
      (3)   The policy and assistance programs will be reviewed at safety
meetings; and
      (4)   Every supervisor will receive training to help him/her recognize
and manage employees with alcohol and other drug problems.
   (B)   Note: the County Fiscal Court may change, modify, amend or rescind any
part of this policy at any time that deals with the actual administration of
the policy itself. However, changes may not be made to the policy that would
circumvent any requirements associated with 803 KAR 25:280.

loss of email, network and computer access privileges and possible disciplinary
action as outlined herein. Reviews of usage patterns will be performed if
violations of this policy are suspected.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 31.01 INTRODUCTION; PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “County of
McLean Code of Ethics”.
   (B)   Findings. The legislative body of the county finds and declares that:
      (1)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts;
      (2)   The vitality and stability of the government of the county depends
upon the public’s confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed
officers and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the
private interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that
confidence is imperiled; and
      (3)   The government of the county has a duty to provide its citizens
with standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
   (C)   Purpose and authority.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring
that standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for
officers and employees of the county shall be clearly established, uniform in
their application and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of
the county with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of
interest which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
      (2)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements
of H.B.238, as enacted by the 1994 State General Assembly.
      (3)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the county by KRS

the violation will be irreparable or irreversible. Also, nothing in this
subchapter shall prohibit the county from correcting the violation through self
help and to file liens on premises, whether real or personal, to recover the
costs incurred by the county.

following information:
      (1)   The date and time of issuance;
      (2)   The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued;
      (3)   The date and time the offense was committed;
      (4)   The facts constituting the offense;
      (5)   The section of the ordinance or other code violated;
      (6)   The name of the code enforcement officer;

does not contest the citation;
      (8)   The maximum civil fine that may be imposed if the person elects to
contest the citation;
      (9)   The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil
fine or to contest the citation; and
      (10)   A statement that if the person pays the civil fine set forth in
the citation or fails to contest the citation within the time allowed. the
person shall be deemed as having waived the right to a hearing before the Code
Enforcement Board and the determination that a violation was committed shall be
final.
   (E)   After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, the code enforcement
officer shall physically deliver an identical copy of the citation to the Clerk
designated by the Board.
   (F)   The alleged violator to whom the citation is issued shall respond to
the citation within seven days of the date of issuance by either paying the
civil fine or requesting, in writing to the Board Clerk, a hearing before the
Code Enforcement Board to contest the citation. If the alleged violator fails
to respond to the citation within seven days, the alleged violator shall be
deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a
violation was committed shall be considered final.
   (G)   If the alleged violator does not contest the citation within the time
prescribed, the Code Enforcement Board shall enter a final order determining
that the violation was committed and impose the civil fine set forth in the
citation. A copy of the final order shall be served on the person guilty of the

residence with any individual residing therein who is 18 years of age or older
and who is informed of the contents of the notice.
   (C)   Failure to appear. Any person requesting a hearing before the Board
who fails to appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived the right to
a hearing to contest the citation and the determination that a violation was
committed shall be final. The Board shall enter a final order determining the
violation was committed and shall impose the civil fine set forth in the
citation. A copy of the final order shall be served on the person guilty of the
violation.

§ 95.02 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is the protection of the general public’s
safety, health, general welfare and protection of property and the environment
in the county that could otherwise be endangered by the uncontrolled and
unauthorized or threatened release of a hazardous substance, pollutant,
contaminant or reportable quantity of a petroleum product. This chapter
requires the forthwith reporting of an occurrence and the emergency response
thereafter. This chapter specifics the responsibility and authority of the
administering agency and the responsibility and consequent liability of any
user or party responsible for an environmental emergency. This chapter attaches
penalties and the means of recovering costs from a user or any party who is in
violation of the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   This chapter is consistent with KRS 224.1-400. The Fiscal Court of the
county shall cause this chapter to be incorporated with Section “Q” of the
County’s Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) for information purposes only.
   (C)   This chapter is applicable to any user or other person or entity who
shall cause, or allow the unauthorized or threatened release of a hazardous
substance, pollutant, contaminant or reportable quantity of petroleum products
in the county. The occurrence shall be declared an environmental emergency and
all provisions of this chapter shall be effective and enforceable.
   (D)   This chapter is not directed to those users who cause an authorized
release in accordance with a valid permit granted by the state or federal
agency with jurisdiction over such occurrence where the time, location,
quantity and manner of release is to occur or a release is in substantially
lesser quantities than those reportable quantities established by state or
federal law, regulation or administrative policy. However, this chapter shall
permit the administering agency to verify such a release is valid and that it
does not warrant enacting the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   In the event that an unauthorized or threatened release involves a
fixed facility in the county, notification shall be given by calling 911 with
the detailed status and nature of the environmental emergency and on-site
emergency response action initiated by the facility personnel. Each fixed
facility in the county shall provide training for all employees and users as
required by State Department of Labor and OSHA standards and regulations. The
administering agency shall have the right for announced, periodic inspections
by the IDES Director and the fixed facility shall have preplanning documents
filed with IDES and updated at least annually or when the quantity,
concentration or material is increased beyond usual and customary inventory.
The owner and management personnel of any fixed facility shall be liable under
the provisions of this chapter for any occurrence detected outside the property
of the fixed facility which is the result of an unauthorized release or if the
authorized release results in exceeding the permitted release. On-site
liability shall be determined by the commonwealth’s Department of Labor or
OSHA.

time sheets, equipment logs, laboratory reports or statements from responding
personnel or user. All such action shall be based on the capability of the
county to meet any commitment of finances, personnel or equipment.
   (C)   IDES shall utilize only those responding personnel who are trained at
their respective level of hazardous or emergency response. IDES shall have the
authority for management of the environmental emergency on the site and
coordinate with any state and federal agencies involved with the occurrence in
a manner to minimize the risk to the general public and environment.
   (D)   IDES shall make an official report of any occurrence to the county’s
Fiscal Court at its next regular scheduled meeting. The report shall detail the

as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) below, plus
the sales factor, described in division (C) below, and the denominator of which
is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) below.
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (A) through (D) below, the business
entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the Occupational Tax
Office.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the county during the tax period by the business
entity for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation
paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the county based on the time the
individual’s service is performed within the county.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the county during the tax period, and
the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sales, lease or rental of tangible personal property is in the
county if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States Government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
county regardless of the F.O.B. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory or other place of storage in the county and the purchaser is the United
States Government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenue from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the county based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the county and
the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-
producing activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the county, the
business entity may petition the county or the county may require, in respect
to all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the county, the

as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the county.
The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the county bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the county to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this section,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
(Ord. 20.220.7, passed 12-22-2020)

shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter ending
thereafter on or before the end of the month following the close of each
quarter, make a return and report to the county, and pay to the county, the tax
required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or
required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the county.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the county any sums
required by this subchapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and

employer who fails to withhold or pay over to the county sums required to be
withheld under this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the

amounts withheld were required to be paid to the county. If the employer fails
to withhold, the lien shall commence at the time the liability of the employer
is assessed by the county.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the county a reconciliation of the occupational

determined by the county, shall be submitted.
   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or before
January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee
for payment to the county during the preceding calendar year.
   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this subchapter shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid to one or
more employees of any business entity, and neither the corporate dissolution or
withdrawal of the business entity from the county, nor the cessation of holding
any corporate office, shall discharge that liability of any person; provided
that, the personal and individual liability shall apply to each or every person
holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became obligated.
No person shall be personally and individually liable under this division (H)
who had no authority to collect, truthfully account for or pay over any tax
imposed by this subchapter at the time that the taxes imposed by this
subchapter become or became due.
   (I)   Every employee receiving compensation in the county subject to the tax
imposed under §
110.03 of this chapter shall be personally liable for the tax notwithstanding
the provisions of divisions (G) and (H) above. In all cases where the employer
does not withhold the tax levied under this subchapter from the employee, such
employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the county each
quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer. If an employer fails
to or is not required to withhold, report or pay the license fee it shall
become the duty of the employee to file with the county. The only employer that
is not required to withhold, report and pay the occupational license tax is the
Federal Government including the United States Postal Service. The payment
required to be made by an employee, can be made quarterly, for the periods
ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, or at any
time the employee wishes to make an estimated payment for the year in which
wages are earned. All license fees must be received by February 28 for the
preceding calendar year, together with a copy of the employee’s W-2 form.
Employers not required to withhold, report or pay the license fee must annually
during the month of January of each year, make a return to the Occupational Tax
Administrator, in which is set forth the name and Social Security number of
each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar year, giving the
amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation earned during such
preceding year by each such employee. This list shall include all current full-
time employees, part-time employees, temporary employees and terminated
employees whether it be voluntary or involuntary.

year, which shall be made by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
the close of the fiscal year. Blank forms for returns shall be supplied by the
county.
   (B)   Whenever, in the opinion of the Occupational Tax Administrator, it is
necessary to examine the federal income tax return of any business entity in

taxable income of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of
the business entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.

appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the county at the time

state’s Department of Revenue and maintains the privileged character of the
information so furnished; provided, further, that, the county may publish
statistics based on such information in such a manner as not to reveal data

collected within each calendar quarter upon the lives of persons residing

§ 113.03 AMOUNT OF FEE FOR COMPANIES ISSUING POLICIES OTHER THAN LIFE

all premiums returned to policyholders. In determining the amount of license
fee or tax to be collected and to be paid to the city, the insurance company
shall use the tax rate effective on the first day of the policy term. When an
insurance company collects a premium as a result of a change in the policy
during the policy term, the tax rate used shall be the rate in effect on the
effective date of the policy change. With respect to premiums returned to
policyholders, the license fee or tax shall be returned by the insurance
company to the policyholder pro rata on the unexpired amount of the premium at
the same rate at which it was collected and shall be taken as a credit by the

outside the legal corporate limits of the city which was paid the license fee
or tax, the insurance company or agent shall be refunded those license fees and
taxes within 90 days of notice to the city paid.
      (2)   License fees which are not paid on or before the due date shall
bear interest at the tax interest rate as defined in KRS 131.010(6) from the
date due until paid. Such interest payable to the city is separate from
penalties provided for in KRS 91A.080(7). In addition, the city may assess a

Barnes vs. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other
communities including, but not limited to: Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis and
Saint Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas;
Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California;
Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio;
and Beaumont, Texas; as well as on findings from the report of Attorney
General’s Working Group on the regulation of sexually-oriented businesses (6-6-
1989, State of Minnesota), the Fiscal Court finds as follows.
   (A)   Sexually-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of such
establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to ensure that the
owners of those establishments will be responsible for the activities that
occur on their premises.
   (B)   Certain employees of sexually-oriented business defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
   (C)   Sexual acts occur at sexually-oriented businesses, especially those
which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films,
videos or live sex shows.
   (D)   Offering and providing space for such activities encourages
occurrences thereof and thereby create unhealthy conditions.
   (E)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually-oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually-oriented businesses.
   (F)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually-oriented businesses.
   (G)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing,
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States; and, through December, 2001,
there have been 1,284,059 reported cases of AIDS in the United States.
   (H)   As of 12-31-2003, there have been 4,071 reported cases of AIDS in the
commonwealth.
   (I)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
like syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
   (J)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the
failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
   (K)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually- oriented businesses where persons view adult-oriented
films.
   (L)   The findings noted in divisions (A) through (K) above raise
substantial governmental concerns.
   (M)   Sexually-oriented businesses, especially premises with adult booths,
have operational characteristics which engender substantial government
concerns.
   (N)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on
premises with adult booths advance a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
   (O)   The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the county
will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the commonwealth has, in KRS 67.084, delegated to local
government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as lo minimize future flood-blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination
of both. In A ZONES, flood waters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are
usually not a significant threat lo structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base
flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use, which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   A1-30 AND AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO AND AR/A ZONES. Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   A99 ZONE. The part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s Flood
Insurance Rale Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three
feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood, which has a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. (Also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD.) BASE FLOOD is the
term used throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH and AR/AO
that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1%
or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank or other human-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for STRUCTURE.
   C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES. Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular
program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated or qualified community
official) from available technical studies, historical information and other
available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by
flood waters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not

avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and
equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood; and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,

the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized
rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date
of the initial FIRM.
   ENCLOSURE. The portion of a structure below the base flood elevation (BFE)
used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage or access to the
structure.
   ENCROACHMENT. The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth,
fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a
floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before 1-1-1975, for FIRMs
effective before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to as
EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the county based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-YEAR FLOOD have a moderate to
low risk of flooding.
   FLOOD, FLOODING or FLOOD WATER.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See MUDSLIDES.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See FLOOD-
RELATED EROSION.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e., mud flow) and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing
flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and/or the Flood Boundary
Floodway Map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by flood waters from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency
preparedness plans, flood-control works, floodplain management ordinances and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOOD-PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOOD-PROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is water-tight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. The area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory
floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/
or hydrologic analysis.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components and the like.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
151.27 of this chapter, the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the Fiscal Court
will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100
years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit (i.e., county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry).
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood-routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).
      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, flood-proof, demolish
or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KRS 151.250. Plans for dams, levees and the like to be approved and permit
issued by the Cabinet (Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet).
       (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood-control districts or systems or similar bodies, shall
commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of any
dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction, except those
constructed by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, in the floodplain or
floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such work have
been:
         (a)   Submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement; and
         (b)   Approved in writing by the Cabinet and a permit issued.
         However, the Cabinet by administrative regulation may exempt those
dams, embankments or other obstructions that are not of such size or type as to
require approval by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water
supply.
       (2)   No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filing of, or place a building, barrier, or
obstruction of any sort in, any area in the floodplain or floodway, unless
plans and specifications for such work have been submitted to and approved by
the Cabinet and a permit issued as required in division (1) above.
       (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the Cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes. However, the Cabinet may require
approval prior to construction of structures, dams, embankments, levees,
bridges, fill, or other construction related to agricultural operations that
impact the base flood of a stream.
      (4)   The Department for Natural Resources, through KRS Ch. 350, shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Ch. 151 concerning the regulation of dams,
levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills or other obstructions across or
along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Ch. 350 for surface coal-mining operations.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs include the following
categories.
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA
amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations and planimetric features.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION - FILL (LOMR-F). A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   LEVEE. A human-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM.
      (1)   A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
      (2)   For a LEVEE SYSTEM to be recognized, the following criteria must be
met.
         (a)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
         (b)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or
state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a
community participating in the NFIP.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood-resistant material, void
of utilities, except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support or
basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of
construction. It does not include earth that is displaced for aesthetic or
landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure’s foundation
system.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided that, such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME.
      (1)   A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built
on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected or attached to the required utilities.
      (2)   The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers and similar
transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
and intended to be improved property.

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP. The Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter
suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.
(The letter “A” is not used by FEMA; the letter “B” is the first revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or
adjusted assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL). The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on a community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures; and to minimize the costs of
disaster response and recovery.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUD FLOW). Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (i.e, MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is
in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works and floodplain management regulations.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA. An area with land surfaces and slopes
of unconsolidated material where the history, geology and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRMs. Refer to
FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of the county’s floodplain management
regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on

   This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas (SFHA), areas
applicable to KRS 51.250 and, as determined by the Floodplain Administrator or
other delegated, designated or qualified community official as determined by
the Fiscal Court of the county from available technical studies, historical
information and other available and reliable sources, areas within the
jurisdiction of the Fiscal Court of the county which may be subject to periodic
inundation by flood waters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare of the citizens of the county.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.

dated 4-18-2011, with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS), other
supporting data and any subsequent amendments thereto, are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. This FIS and
attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may
be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this
chapter and which are recommended to the Fiscal Court by the Floodplain
Administrator and are enacted by the Fiscal Court pursuant to statutes
governing land use management regulations. The FIS and/or FIRM are permanent
records of the county and are on file and available for review by the public
during regular business hours at County Courthouse.

§ 151.12 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the Fiscal Court of the county, any
officer or employee, the commonwealth, the Federal Insurance Administration or
the Federal Emergency Management Agency thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.13 ENFORCEMENT; VIOLATION NOTICE.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duty authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed.
   (C)   Notice of citation.
      (1)   If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or agent of the
Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a person has
caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and conditions of
a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications thereof, a duly
authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a citation to the
offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation issued, how the
violation is to be remedied to bring the development into conformity with this
chapter or with the approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy
is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are recommended.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 151.25 LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR; DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   The Fiscal Court of the county hereby appoints the Judge Executive or
designee to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter by
granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions, and
is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   (1)   The Floodplain Administrator and or staff is hereby appointed,
authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of
this chapter. The Floodplain Administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this chapter, which are consistent with its spirit and
purpose by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its
provisions.
      (2)   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator
shall include, but not be limited to the following:
         (a)   Permit review. Review all development permits to ensure that:
            1.   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
            2.   All other required state and federal permits have been
obtained: review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have
been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by federal or state law, including § 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1344;
            3.   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner; and
            4.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the
carrying capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter,
ADVERSELY AFFECTS means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
         (b)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
151.07 of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer §§
151.40 through
151.46 of this chapter. Any such information shall be submitted to the Fiscal
Court for adoption.
         (c)   Notification of other agencies.
            1.   Notify adjacent communities, the commonwealth’s Division of
Water and any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory
authority prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse;

Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and
            3.   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
         (d)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
            1.   Certification required by §
151.41(B) of this chapter (lowest floor elevations) as shown on a completed and
certified elevation certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
or substantially improved structures, in accordance with §
151.41(B) of this chapter;
            2.   Certification required by §
151.41(B) of this chapter (elevation or flood-proofing of non-residential
structures) as shown on a completed and certified flood-proofing certificate.
Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which
the new or substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed, in
accordance with §
151.26(B) of this chapter;
            3.   Certification required by §
151.41 of this chapter (elevated structures);
            4.   Certification of elevation required by §

         (e)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
            1.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
151.27(C)(2) of this chapter.
            2.   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
151.07 of this chapter, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonable utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available
from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of
§§
151.40 through
151.46 of this chapter;
            3.   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure,
the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
151.41(B) of this chapter a flood-proofing certificate; and
            4.   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall
be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be open
for public inspection.
         (f)   Right of entry.
            1.   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the Administrator has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any
condition or ordinance violation which makes such building, structure or
premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Administrator may enter such
building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or
perform any duty imposed upon the Administrator by this chapter.
            2.   If such structure or premises are occupied, he or she shall
first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure
or premises are unoccupied, he or she shall first make a reasonable effort to
locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such request
entry.
            3.   If entry is refused, the Administrator shall have recourse to
every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
            4.   When the Administrator shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or
occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building,
structure or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the administrator for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter.
         (g)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the Administrator, work on
any building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the
provisions of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in
writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her
agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under
which work may be resumed.
         (h)   Revocation of permits.
            1.   The Administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued
under the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based.
            2.   The Administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by
the Administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this chapter.
         (i)   Liability. Any officer, employee or member of the Floodplain
Administrator’s staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties, shall
not thereby render himself or herself personally liable, and is hereby relieved
from all personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or
property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his
or her duties. Any suit brought against any officer, employee or member because
of such act performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this
chapter shall be defended by the Department of Law until the final termination
of the proceedings.
         (j)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A floodplain
construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced construction
within 180 calendar days from the date of its issuance by the Floodplain
Administrator.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.26 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (A)   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or
other development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
151.07 of this chapter. Application for a development permit shall be made on
forms furnished by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development
activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in
duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing.
Endorsement of local administrator is required before a state floodplain
construction permit can be processed.
   (B)   Specifically, the following information is required.
      (1)   Application stage.
         (a)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade;
         (b)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
non-residential structure will be flood-proofed;
         (c)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§
151.41(B) and
151.43(B) of this chapter; and
         (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      (2)   Construction stage.
         (a)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH and A
Zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
         (b)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood-
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.27 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the Fiscal Court to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare, The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The Fiscal Court of the
county shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of the county’s Board of
Adjustments.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall bear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local Circuit Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use lo the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary lo further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the Fiscal Court need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which (the Fiscal Court believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
151.05 of this chapter, under “public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or
victimization of the public (as defined in §
151.05 of this chapter) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use; provided that, the provisions of divisions (D)(1)
through (D)(11) above are satisfied and that the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a
public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
and
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (J)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure,
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet the
requirements of “new construction”, as contained in this chapter.
   (K)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure,
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall be
undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
151.07 of this chapter, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and ductwork elevated no lower
than one feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with
standards of division (C) below.
      (1)   In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified.
      (2)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Ch. 4, Regulation 060, states as
a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: the
applicant shall provide cross-sections for determining floodway boundaries (and
thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA
maps are not available. All cross-sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than +0.5 foot.
Cross-sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent
significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of
the base floodplain change. Each cross-section shall extend across the entire
base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by
the Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not
occur, the cabinet may require additional cross-sections or specific site
elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory flood
way boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the Community Building Inspection
Department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (B)(1) below or together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be flood-proofed below an elevation one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and
ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
elevation;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth herein;
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) below;
and
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood-resistant materials below an
elevation one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood water. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin
1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood water.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts or pilings (e.g., that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation) shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls:
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed
on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH and AE on the community’s Flood

            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood.
         (b)   All manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above
the level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
so that either the:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-30,
AO, AH and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must either:
         (a)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         (c)   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured
homes”.
      (4)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed
and insured in accordance with the state’s motor vehicle regulations, is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
151.07 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; and
      (2)   If division (E)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
151.40 through
151.46 of this chapter.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.42 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.07 of this chapter, where streams exist, but where no base flood data has
been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the
following provisions apply.
   (A)   (1)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community.
      (2)   The engineering certification should be supported by technical data
that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
151.07 of this chapter.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.43 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.07 of this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding areas.
   (B)   These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of
one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water
path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions apply.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO, the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall:
         (a)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade; and
         (b)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely flood-proofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so
that any space below that level is water-tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
151.41(B) of this chapter.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.44 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available
(Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is
the lesser, shall be provided.
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood
elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.45 STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE
LETTER “A”.
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated “A”,

§ 151.46 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of the base flood
elevation at the site. Flood-proofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into flood
waters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 10.630.1, passed 3-15-2011)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no less than $500 or imprisoned for not more than 90 days, or both, and,
in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day
such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

§ 152.006 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   These land subdivision regulations are adopted as minimum
requirements, and all developers should consider developing their subdivisions
at higher standards. Thus, the developer Is encouraged to go beyond the
requirements of these regulations and the Planning Commission may require
standards above the minimum contained herein, whenever it feels that public
health, safety or welfare purposes justify such increases.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may also reduce or otherwise vary the
requirements of these regulations whenever it encounters the situations
described below. In granting such variances, the Commission may attach and
require whatever conditions it feels are necessary to secure the basic
objectives of the regulations.
   (B)   Exceptional conditions. When the Commission finds that strict
application of these regulations would result in extreme physical difficulties
because of exceptional and unique topographic or other physical conditions, the
Commission may modify these regulations to the extent necessary to provide
relief from the undue hardship; provided, however, that, such relief may be
granted, without detriment to the public welfare and substantially impairing
the intent and purpose of these regulations. In granting such variances or
modifications, the Planning Commission may require such conditions as will
substantially secure the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied
or modified. A financial disadvantage to the property owner is no proof of
hardship within the purpose of these regulations.
   (C)   Design innovation and large scale development. These regulations may
be modified by the Planning Commission in the case of plans for cluster
development, planned unit development or other design innovations which, in the
Commission’s opinion, achieve the basic objectives of these regulations. The
Commission may require such conditions, as it deems necessary to secure the
objectives of these regulations.

supervision of the developer’s engineer.
(Ord. passed 10- -1977; Ord. passed 1-6-1998; Ord. passed 11-12-2001)
§ 152.067 STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Streets within or adjacent to a proposed subdivision shall be classified
according to one or more of the classifications noted below, and physical
improvements and design standards shall be required in accordance with the
fallowing standards.
   (A)   Right-of-way and pavement width.
Street Type Minimum Dedicated Right-of-Way Width Minimum Pavement Width
Street Type            Minimum Dedicated Right-of-Way Minimum Pavement Width
                       Width
Alley                  20 feet                        20 feet
Arterial street        80 feet                        44 feet
Collector street       60 feet                        36 feet

Minor street           40 feet                        24 feet
NOTES TO TABLE:
The major street plan may indicate greater right-of-way widths for certain
limited access and arterial streets, but in no case shall the subdivider be
required to dedicate more than 80 feet for any one street.
 
   (B)   Base course. The base course shall consist of dense graded aggregate,
as defined in Art. 3.3.2-A of Kentucky Department of Highways Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, 2007 Edition, as revised and
amended. The base course shall be bonded with water and rolled to a smooth
surface.
   (C)   Surface. The surface shall consist of 200 pounds per square yard of
State Department of Highways Class I, Type B, bituminous concrete (using P.A.C.
5 or P.A.C. 7 bitumen), as defined in Art. 4.3.4-A-3 of Kentucky Department of
Highways Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, 2007
Edition, as revised and amended, or a comparable surface approved by the
Planning Commission.
   (D)   Drainage. The proposed layout and design of streets and lots within a
shall be conductive to proper drainage patterns.
   (E)   Conformity to major street plan. The location of all streets in a
proposed subdivision shall conform in general alignment to the major street
plan.
   (F)   Street continuity. The proposed street layout shall provide for the
continuation of existing streets to adjoining tracts, unless the Planning
Commission deems such extension undesirable for specific reasons of topography
or design. Where it is desirable, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, to
provide street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended
by dedication to the boundary of such property.
   (G)   Relation to topography. Streets shall be designed with respect to
topography to produce the most usable and properly situated lots, provide
proper drainage for storm water and produce proper grades.
   (H)   Street names. Proposed streets in alignment with existing streets
should bear the name of the existing street. When streets are not in alignment,
no names shall be used which would duplicate or be confused with names of
existing streets.
   (I)   Conflicting traffic or land use. When a proposed subdivision contains
or is adjacent to existing or proposed railroad right-of-way, other significant
rights-of-way or conflicting and detrimental land uses, the Planning Commission
may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots, lots with rear
service alleys, lots with additional depth or other measures which may be
necessary for protection of abutting properties and the maintenance or junction
of major traffic arteries.
   (J)   Portions of streets (proposed). New half or partial streets shall not
be permitted. The entire minimum right-of-way shall be dedicated when a
proposed subdivision is located on one or both sides of a street.
   (K)   Existing deficient street rights-of-way. Subdivisions platted along
existing streets should dedicate additional right-of-way, if necessary, to meet
the minimum width requirements specified in these regulations.
   (L)   Reserve strips and private streets. There shall be no reserve strips
or private streets platted within a subdivision.
   (M)   Oversized improvements. When street rights-of-way or improvements are
required in excess of what is necessary to meet the demands of the subdivision
under consideration, the Commission should require dedication or improvement
costs of the developer only to the extent required by his or her subdivision.
The appropriate authorities should be encouraged to finance the acquisition or
cost of the additional improvements.
   (N)   Street intersections. Minimum standards for intersection design are as
follows.
      (1)   Number of approaches. Intersections involving more than four basic
street approaches shall be prohibited. Merging lanes, deceleration lanes, “Y”
intersections and the like are not in this prohibition and are considered as
parts of one-street approach.
      (2)   Angle of intersection. For a tangent distance of at least 100 feet,
measured from the intersection of right-of-way lines, all streets should
intersect at an angle of 90 degrees. In no case should the angle of
intersection be less than 75 degrees.
      (3)   Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150
feet should not be made.
      (4)   Excessive grades at intersections. When a street grade at the
approach to an intersection exceeds 3%, a leveling area shall be provided with
grades of not greater than 3% for a distance of 50 feet from the intersection
of street centerlines. Vertical curves shall then be used to connect the
intersecting grades.
   (O)   Minimum property line radii. At street intersections, the minimum
radius at property lines shall be 20 feet for all streets.
(Ord. passed 10- -1977; Ord. passed 1-6-1998; Ord. passed 11-12-2001)
§ 152.068 BLOCK DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following standards shall be observed in the design of blocks.
   (A)   Residential block length. Intersecting streets shall be provided at
such intervals as necessary to meet existing street patterns, topography and
standards required for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian
circulation. Blocks should not, however, exceed 1,600 feet in length, nor be
less than 500 feet in length.
   (B)   Residential block width. The width of blocks shall be sufficient to
provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth.
   (C)   Non-residential blocks. Blocks intended for non-residential uses shall
be of such length width, and other design as the Commission finds necessary for
the prospective use, including adequate provision for off-street parking,
loading and unloading, and limitation and control of vehicular access points to
adjacent streets.
(Ord. passed 10- -1977; Ord. passed 1-6-1998; Ord. passed 11-12-2001)
§ 152.069 LOT DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following standards shall be required in the design of lots.
   (A)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall be of sufficient width to permit
compliance with the required minimum setback line. In order to comply with the
additional width requirement and continue the same size homes as are on
adjoining lots, corner lots shall be increased to whatever width is necessary.
   (B)   Lot lines. Side lot tines shall be at right angles to straight street
centerlines and radial to curved street centerlines. Rear lot lines should
consist of straight lines with a minimum number of deflections, where
practical.
   (C)   Access. Lots less than 100 feet in width shall have no more than one
point of access to any one public street. There shall be no more than two
points of access to one public street on a lot of less than 400 feet, but more
than 100 feet in width. Lots in excess of 400 feet may have two points of
access to any one public street for each 400 feet of frontage.
      (1)   No point of access shall be allowed within ten feet of the
intersection of the right-of-way lines of intersecting streets.
      (2)   No curbs on city streets or rights-of-way shall be cut or altered
without written approval of the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   A point of access shall not exceed 20 feet in width for one way
and/or lane ingress or egress. Two-way access points shall not exceed 35 feet
in width.
   (D)   Lot dimensions.
      (1)   Lots located in areas where a zoning ordinance is in effect shall
conform to the zoning regulations’ lot size requirement, except residential
lots not served by public sewer, shall be at least 80 feet wide and 20,000
square feet in area. (Where no zoning ordinance is in effect, residential lots
served by public sewer shall be at least 70 feet wide and 7,500 square feet in
area.) Residential lots not served by public sewer shall be at least 80 feet
wide and 20,000 square feet in area.
      (2)   A greater lot area than specified above may be required for
residential lots if, in the opinion of the county’s Health Officer, there are
factors of drainage, soil conditions or other conditions to cause potential
health problems.
   (E)   Building setback line. Lots located in areas where a zoning ordinance
is in effect shall conform to the zoning regulations. Where no zoning ordinance
is in effect, the minimum building setback line for the right-of-way shall be
at least one-half of the total width of the street right-of-way. In no instance
shall this distance be less than 35 feet unless waived by the Commission.
   (F)   Development of hazardous areas. When lots are located on land which is
subject to flooding subsidence, or other hazards injurious to the health and
safety of potential users, and when such hazards cannot be eliminated or
adequate safeguards provided to protect the health and safety of potential
users, the Planning Commission may declare such land to be unsuitable for
subdividing and disapprove such plans or portions thereof.
(Ord. passed 10- -1977; Ord. passed 1-6-1998; Ord. passed 11-12-2001)
§ 152.070 EASEMENT DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Utilities. Easements 12 feet in width may be required between, at the
rear, or in front of lots, whenever necessary. Easement of greater width may be
required if necessary for the extension of water and sewer lines or other
utilities.
   (B)   Storm water drainage easement. Storm water easements or drainage
rights-of-way may be required by the Planning Commission if necessary for
proper drainage within or through a subdivision.
   (C)   Connection to existing easements. When necessary, utility and drainage
easements shall connect with existing easements on adjoining property.
(Ord. passed 10- -1977; Ord. passed 1-6-1998; Ord. passed 11-12-2001)
§ 152.071 COMMUNITY FACILITIES DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Assessing the need for community facilities. During the review of
subdivision plats, the Planning Commission shall consider the adequacy of
existing or proposed community facilities which will serve the additional
population to be housed in a proposed subdivision. Subdivides shall consider
dedicating or reserving land for facilities that will be needed in a
subdivision, such as public buildings, recreational areas and shopping
facilities.
   (B)   Adequacy of such areas. Areas provided or reserved for such community
facilities shall be adequate for building sites, landscaping and off-street
parking.
(Ord. passed 10- -1977; Ord. passed 1-6-1998; Ord. passed 11-12-2001)
§ 152.072 OTHER REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Water supply system. Where public water supply, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, is reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall construct a
complete water distribution system, having a minimum of a six-inch main line
and including a connection for each lot. Appropriately spaced fire hydrants
shall be required when the water flow meets ISO flow requirements. In the event
ISO flow requirements are not met, then the Planning Commission, in its
discretion, may order the installation of fire hydrants should they believe
that at a future time water pressure would be adequate. In the event a public
water supply is not within a reasonable distance, then the subdivider shall
provide the lots with an alternate water supply that shall be approved by the
county’s Health Officer.
   (B)   Storm drainage. Adequate provisions for storm water drainage shall be
provided in accordance with standards specified by the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Sanitary sewers. Where the public sanitary sewer system, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission, is reasonably accessible, sanitary sewers
shall be installed to adequately serve all lots with connections to the public
system; approval of the size line will be obtained from the Engineer. Where
lots cannot be served by the extension of an existing public sanitary sewer,
the subdivider shall obtain approval of lot sizes from the county’s Health
Officer for individual septic tanks and disposal fields, or approval of a
neighborhood disposal system.
   (D)   Electric supply system. Provision shall be made in every subdivision
for a satisfactory electric supply system. Every consideration should be given
to the possibility of underground installation of all necessary wires.
   (E)   Monuments.
      (1)   Concrete monuments. Two concrete monuments at least 36 inches in
length and four inches square with a suitable center point shall be set on at
least two corners of the boundary of a subdivision, as required by a certified
Engineer.
      (2)   Iron pin monuments. Iron pin monuments three-fourths’ inch in
diameter and at least 24 inches long shall be placed at all points on boundary
lines where there is a change of direction and at all lot comers. These pins
shall be placed only after all grading and other construction have been
completed.
   (F)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks may be required on lots abutting a public access
and shall have a minimum width of four feet.
   (G)   Intent. It is not the intent of these regulations to impose
prohibitive or unduly restrictive requirements upon subdivision development,
but rather to promote orderly growth and progressive development as herein
above set out, and in determining the adequacy of storm water drainage and
whether or not public water supply and public sanitary sewers are reasonably
accessible, due consideration will be given to economic factors involved,
including relative cost of connection to public water system compared to
separate water distribution system, and relative costs of installation of
individual septic tank and disposal field or neighborhood disposal system as
compared to connection with public system and installation of sanitary sewer
system.
(Ord. passed 10- -1977; Ord. passed 1-6-1998; Ord. passed 11-12-2001)
§ 152.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person or entity who violates any of these provisions or any of
the regulations adopted pursuant hereunder for which no other penalty is
provided, shall upon conviction be fined not less than $10, but no more than
$500, for each conviction. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate
offense.
   (B)   Any person, owner or agent who violates this chapter shall, upon
conviction, be fined not less than $100, nor more than $500, for each lot or
parcel which was the subject of sale or transfer, or a contract for sale or
transfer.

of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation;

under KRS 522.030. The confidentiality of the applications and any updates of
the application can be waived by the written authorization of the applicant.
   (C)   Application fee. An applicant for the construction of cellular antenna
towers for cellular telecommunications services or personal communications
services shall pay an application fee in the amount set by the Planning
Commission upon submission of a uniform application.
   (D)   Processing of application. Applications for the construction of
cellular antenna towers for cellular telecommunications services or personal
communications services shall be processed as follows.
      (1)   At least one public hearing on the proposal shall be held, at which
hearing interested parties and citizens shall have the opportunity to be heard.
Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at least once,
in the highest circulation newspaper in the city-county; provided that, one
publication occurs not less than seven calendar days nor more than 21 calendar
days before the occurrence of such hearing. A public notice sign will also be
placed on the property by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Notice of the hearing shall be given at least 14 days in advance of
the hearing to the owner of every parcel of property within 500 feet of the
proposed tower or property contiguous to the site upon which the tower is
proposed to be constructed. Records maintained by the property valuation
administrator may be relied upon conclusively to determine the identity and
address of said owner. In the event a property is in condominium or cooperative
forms of ownership, then the person notified by mail shall be the president or
chairperson of the owner group that administers property commonly owned by the
condominium or cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two or more
co-owners of an adjoining property who are listed in the property valuation
administrator’s records as having the same address.
      (3)   Upon holding the hearing, the Planning Commission shall, within 60
days, commencing from the date that the application is received by the Planning
Commission, or within a date specified in a written agreement between the

disapprove the uniform application. If the Planning Commission fails to issue a
final decision within 60 days, and if there is no written agreement between the
Planning Commission and the utility to a specific date for the Planning
Commission to issue a decision. It shall be presumed that the Planning
Commission has approved the utility’s uniform application.
(Ord. 20.920-1, passed 3- -2020)
§ 153.174 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   An applicant shall provide information demonstrating compliance with the
requirements contained herein. Potential sites that should be considered (in
order from most preferred to least preferred) include street rights-of-way,
existing utility towers, industrial zones, commercial zones and government
buildings. Where the Planning Commission finds that circumstances or conditions
relating to the particular application are such that one or more of the
requirements listed below are not necessary or desirable for the protection of
surrounding property or the public health, safety and general welfare, and that
such special conditions or circumstances make one or more said requirements
unreasonable, the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
may modify or waive such requirement, either permanently or on a temporary
basis. Any such modification or waiver shall be requested by the applicant, and
the applicant shall submit a written justification for each requested
modification or waiver.
   (A)   Permitted by zone. Monopole cellular antenna towers shall be permitted
in any zone. Lattice and guyed cellular antenna towers shall be permitted in
any zone, except for residential zones.
   (B)   Distance. Lattice and guyed cellular antenna towers distance from
residential buildings when constructed in an agricultural zone, said towers
shall be located a minimum distance of not less than 250 feet from all existing
residential structures. Distance shall be measured from the base of the tower
to the nearest wall of the residential structure.
   (C)   Setbacks. All structures constructed in connection with guyed or
lattice cellular antenna towers, except fences and/or guy wires, shall be s
minimum distance from the property line or lease line equal to at least one-
half the height of the tower, but not less than 50 feet. All structures
constructed in connection with monopole or alternative cellular antenna tower
shall comply with the applicable setback requirements established for other
structures within the applicable zoning district. Alternative cellular antenna
towers that are to be located as part of a utility service facility (e.g.,
power pole or telephone pole) shall comply with setback requirements applicable
to such utility service facilities, if any.
   (D)   Height. A cellular antenna tower, or alternative antenna tower
structure, may be constructed to a maximum height of 200 feet, regardless of
the maximum height requirements listed in the specific zoning district. This
also applies to any tower taller than 15 feet constructed on the top of another
building or structure, with the height being the overall height of building/
structure and tower together, measured from the grade to the highest point. The
Planning Commission may allow antennas greater than 200 feet in height upon
review of the applicant’s justification that the additional height meets the
criteria identified herein.
   (E)   Construction. The cellular antenna tower shall be constructed in
compliance with the current ANSI/EIA/TIA 222-F standards and other applicable
state standards.
   (F)   Illumination. Cellular antenna towers shall not be illuminated, except

within the front, side or rear yard. The use of barbed-wire or sharp pointed
fences shall be prohibited in or along any boundary adjoining residential or Ml
IP Zones.
   (I)   Screening. Screening shall be provided by evergreen trees, with a
minimum height of six feet, planted in a staggered pattern at a maximum
distance of 15 feet on center. The screening shall be placed in an area between
the property line, or lease line, and a ten-foot setback.
   (J)   Access drives. Surfacing of all driveways and off-street parking areas
shall comply with the requirements of the applicable local zoning ordinance;
the Planning Commission may allow gravel access drives in cases where it is
determined there is a hardship or other mitigating circumstances.
   (K)   Signs. There shall be no signs permitted, except those displaying
emergency information, owner contact information, warning or safety
instructions, or signs that are required by a federal, state or local agency.
Such signs shall not exceed five square feet in area.
   (L)   Number of service providers. All new cellular antenna towers shall be
designed and constructed to accommodate a minimum of three service providers.
   (M)   Lease agreements. All option and site lease agreements shall not
prohibit the possibility of co-location, and in the case of abandonment, shall

approval is not required shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a building
permit for the construction of the cellular antenna tower.
   (O)   Mitigation design standards. Mitigating design standards for cellular
antenna towers in residential zones. When no adequate alternate site for a
cellular antenna tower is available, a site in a residential zone may be
permitted. The Planning Commission shall consider the following mitigating
design standards and may reduce or modify these standards in cases where it can
be demonstrated that there is extreme hardship.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall have the power to impose additional
landscaping requirements, which may include plantings, trees and fencing
designed to complement the character of the landscaping in the surrounding
residential area.
      (2)   Design and materials to be used in the accessory building or
buildings may be required to be submitted to the Planning Commission for review
and approval.
      (3)   Asphalt or other hard-surface paving shall be provided for
driveways and parking.
      (4)   A one to one (1:1) height-to-yard ratio shall be required. A
reduction in the height-to-yard ratio may be permitted if no other location for
the tower can be found.
      (5)   Monopole or alternative tower design shall be used in any
residential zone; and paint colors, such as light gray or light blue, shall be
used to minimize any negative visual impact the tower or antenna may have on
adjoining properties. The tower must be maintained on a regular basis by the
owner of the facility in order to ensure that it continues to have a minimal
visual impact on the surrounding area.
(Ord. 20.920-1, passed 3- -2020)
§ 153.175 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION.

requests by an applicant for a cellular antenna tower. The Planning Commission
may approve, disapprove or take no action on the request for a cellular antenna
tower.
   (B)   The burden shall be on the applicant to establish the following by a
clear preponderance of the evidence:
      (1)   The application is in agreement with the Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   The application meets all requirements of this chapter;
      (3)   Reasons why the site is appropriate for a cellular antenna tower
and why it will not have an adverse effect on the health, safety and welfare of
the adjoining area;
      (4)   Reasons why the tower will not alter the essential character of the
surrounding area;
      (5)   Reasons why the applicant has been unsuccessful in its attempts to
co-locate on towers designed to host multiple wireless service providers’
facilities or other existing structures, such as a telecommunications tower or
another suitable structure capable of supporting the applicant’s facilities;
and
      (6)   The Planning Commission shall not regulate the placement of a
cellular antenna tower on the basis of the environmental effects of radio
frequency emissions to the extent that the proposed facility complies with the
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission concerning radio frequency
emissions.
(Ord. 20.920-1, passed 3- -2020)
SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS
§ 153.190 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   The components and subsystems required to convert solar energy into
electric energy suitable for use. The area of the system includes all the land
inside the perimeter of the system, which extends to any fencing.
   (B)   For the purposes of these zoning regulations, solar energy systems are
divided into three classes.
      (1)   Level 1 Solar Energy System. A roof-mounted system on any code
compliant structure, an area of up to 50% of the footprint of the primary
structure on the parcel, but not more than one acre and not more than 25 feet
tall or any building integrated system (i.e., shingle, hanging solar, canopy
and the like).
      (2)   Level 2 Solar Energy System. Any ground-mounted system not included
in a Level 1 SES and meets the following area restrictions.
         (a)   In an agricultural zone, the area of the SES shall not exceed
one-half acre in size and shall require a building permit issued by the
Chairperson of the Planning Commission or his or her designee, in areas
exceeding one-half acre, a site plan shall be required by the county’s Planning
Commission.
         (b)   In an industrial zone, the SES shall not exceed ten acres in
size.
         (c)   In an industrial zone, an SES of any size shall require a site
plan approved by the county’s Planning Commission.
      (3)   Level 3 Solar Energy System. Any system that does not satisfy the
parameters for a Level 1 or Level 2 SES.
   (C)   A panel measuring less than 20 square feet for the primary purpose of
charging a battery(s) at a remote site shall be exempt from this regulation
(i.e., weather station, storm warning siren, communications tower and the
like).
(Ord. 20.920-1, passed 3- -2020)
§ 153.191 REQUIREMENTS.
   Solar energy systems (SES) shall comply with the following criteria.
   (A)   The height of any ground-mounted SES shall not exceed 25 feet as
measured from the highest natural grade below each solar panel (excludes
utility poles, substations and antennas constructed for the project).
   (B)   Setback requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 SES shall be in
compliance with the zoning classification for the parcel.
   (C)   Setback requirements for Level 3 SES shall be as follows.
      (1)   All equipment shall be at least 25 feet from the perimeter property
lines of the project area.
      (2)   No interior property line setbacks shall be required if the project
spans multiple contiguous properties.
      (3)   All equipment shall be located at least 100 feet from any
residential structure and the maximum height of any individual component will
be 25 feet measured from the local ground level of the component.
   (D)   All Level 3 SES shall be screened with a seven-foot tall fence and, to
the extent reasonably practicable, a visual buffer that provides reasonable
screening to reduce the view of the SES from residential dwelling units on
adjacent lots (including those lots located across a public right-of-way). A
vegetation screening plan to reduce the view of the SES from residential
dwelling units on adjacent lots will be submitted for approval of the county’s
Planning Commission. The existing natural tree growth and natural land forms
along the SES perimeter may create a sufficient buffer and shall be preserved
when reasonably practicable. When no alternative vegetation screening plan is
approved by the county’s Planning Commission, a double row of staggered
evergreen trees will be planted 15 feet on center from adjacent non-
participating residential dwellings including the outdoor living space
immediately near residential dwellings.
   (E)   Parcel boundaries with no proximity to residential dwellings shall not
require screening. The proposed evergreen trees shall be placed on the exterior
of security fencing. The use of barbed wire or sharp pointed fences shall be
prohibited in or along any boundary adjoining residential properties. There
shall be no signs permitted, except those displaying emergency information,
owner contact information, warning or safety instructions or signs that are
required by a federal, state or local agency. Such signs shall not exceed five
square feet in area.
   (F)   Excessive lighting shall be prohibited except that required by federal
or state regulations.
   (G)   Decommissioning of Level 3 SES shall be as follows.
      (1)   The developer shall post a surety bond, or other form of security
acceptable to the county, for the abandonment of the site and in the event the
Commission must remove the facility. Abandonment shall be when the SES ceases
to transfer energy on a continuous basis for 12 months. The surety bond or
other form or security shall be 1% of the total project cost recalculated every
five years during the project life.
      (2)   A decommissioning plan shall be submitted at the time of
application by the developer responsible for decommissioning and must include
the following:
         (a)   Defined conditions upon which the decommissioning will be
initiated (i.e., there has been no power production for 12 months, the land
lease has ended or succession of use of abandoned facility and the like);
         (b)   Removal of all non-utility owned equipment, conduit, structures,
fencing, roads and foundations to the depth of three feet;
         (c)   Restoration of the property to substantially similar physical
condition that existed immediately prior to construction of the SES;
         (d)   The time frame for completion of decommissioning activities;
         (e)   The party currently responsible for decommissioning; and
         (f)   Plans for updating the decommissioning plan.
