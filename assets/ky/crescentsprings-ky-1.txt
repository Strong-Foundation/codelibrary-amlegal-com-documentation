repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of Council as long as the
repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the original

shall have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or
amendment as the case may be.

arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment

passage date, the conflict shall be so construed as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.

or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can
be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express the intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and
the word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the
correct words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration

of the same offense during a one-year period.

sexual orientation or gender identity.
   (B)   Filing and processing complaints.
      (1)   Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of this chapter
may, within 180 days of the alleged violation, or one year if the alleged

based;
         (c)   The alleged violation;

with another agency or that any complaint concerning this matter filed with
another agency has been dismissed by such agency without a final judgment on

Commission on Human Rights for further processing, investigation and/or
administrative proceedings in accordance with the Kentucky Civil Rights Act,

to the greatest extent practicable.
      (3)   If a settlement is achieved, the City Administrator shall furnish a
copy of a signed conciliation agreement to the complainant and the respondent.
The terms of the conciliation agreement may be made public, but no other
information relating to any complaint, its investigation, or its disposition
may be disclosed without consent of the complainant and the person charged. A
conciliation agreement need not contain a declaration or finding that a
violation has in fact occurred and it may provide for dismissal of the
complaint without prejudice. City Council shall have discretion to approve,
modify, or reject the conciliation agreement.
      (4)   If conciliation is not achieved either by agreement between the
parties or approval by City Council, the City Administrator shall refer the
matter to the Crescent Springs Human Rights Commission, who shall proceed with
a hearing in accordance with the Kentucky Civil Rights Act and KRS Chapter 13B.

recommend a penalty, as provided for herein, subject to the approval of the
City Council for the City of Crescent Springs.
      (5)   The Commission shall submit the final adjudication and recommended
order to the City Council for approval.

and respondent, postage pre-paid. The respondent shall have 30 days to pay any
penalty issued in the order. If the respondent does not pay the penalty within
the time given, then the City Council may direct the City Attorney to place a
lien against the respondent’s property in the Office of the County Clerk where

Penalty, see § 51.99
§ 51.03 EXTENSION OF DRAINS TO RIGHT-OF-WAY.

   (B)    In the event that the lot slopes toward the front, the roof drain
downspouts shall terminate within ten feet of the stucture and shall have a
splash block to spread the water. The intent of this section is to spread the
water over the lawn, encourage absorption by the ground, and to eliminate
concentrations of water directed toward the street.
   (C)    No storm water shall be discharged toward or in the immediate
vicinity of a front property line. The termination of the pipe shall be marked

51.04 herein within 45 days from the date of this chapter. The only exemption
from this shall be drains which prior to this chapter had been placed through
the curb so that storm water empties directly into the public street gutter,
and only then with the written approval of the City Engineer.
(Ord. 1982-15, passed 8-2-82)
§ 51.06 EROSION CONTROL.
   The owner and the contractor shall in all instances do and perform all work

Engineer or Building Inspector.
(Ord. 1982-15, passed 8-2-82)
Penalty, see § 51.99
§ 51.07 DAMAGE OR LOSS TO PROPERTY.
   In any instances where any storm water not being discharged as described
herein from any existing or new structure shall cause damage or loss to any
public lands or structures, the damage or loss shall be repaired or replaced by
the owner of the property from which the storm water came. All costs shall be
borne by the owner and the storm water drain system shall be repaired in
accordance with all provisions of this chapter and any other applicable
ordinance.
(Ord. 1982-15, passed 8-2-82)
§ 51.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person or entity who violates any of the provisions of this
chapter shall upon conviction be fined not less than $50 but no more than $500
for each conviction. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   At the discretion of the enforcement officer, a citation and mail-in

TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES
§ 70.15 SIGNAL LEGENDS.
   Whenever traffic is regulated or controlled exclusively by a traffic-control
sign or signs exhibiting the words "Go," "Caution," or "Stop," or exhibiting
different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)    Green alone or "Go": Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)    Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)    Red alone or double red or "Stop": Vehicular traffic facing the
signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or
at such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall
remain standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.
   (D)    Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed
until it can do so without danger.
   (E)    Flashing amber alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall
reduce its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection controlled by
such signal.
   (F)    "Yield Right-of-Way": Vehicular traffic facing the "Yield Right-of-
Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a "Yield Right-of-Way"
sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a speed in excess
of 15 miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not apply to vehicles
entering an expressway.
   (G)    Lane lights: When lane lights are installed over any street for the
purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing amber lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from
that lane. Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles shall not move
against them. If flashing amber lights show above a lane, that lane shall be
used only for passing and for left turns unless a sign at such place prohibits
such turn.
Penalty, see § 70.99
Statutory reference:
   Traffic-control signals, see KRS 189.338
§ 70.16 POSTING OF TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES AND PARKING SIGNS.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of the Mayor or his designated representative to
study the traffic-control patterns and conditions in the city and to propose
the appropriate traffic-control devices, including no parking zones or time
limits on parking, in order to solve the various traffic-control conditions as
they prevail in the city. At least once each year, the Mayor or his designated
representative shall provide the City Clerk-Treasurer with an inventory of the
various traffic-control devices and parking restriction signs which have been
posted and placed within the municipal boundaries of the city, and those which
are being proposed. Prior to providing the inventory to the City Clerk-
Treasurer, the Mayor or his designated representative shall consult with the
Chief of the Dixie Police Authority and the Chief of the Villa-Crescent Fire
Authority for their review and suggestions on additions and deletions. Once the
inventory or list of traffic-control devices and parking restriction signs has
been provided to the City Clerk-Treasurer, it shall be placed on the agenda at
the next City Council meeting to be confirmed by municipal order, subject to
additions or deletions that may be made by City Council. Any and all traffic-
control devices which have been appropriately placed and posted in the city
must conform to the "Manual Of Uniform Traffic-Control Devices", current
edition.
   (B)   All traffic-control devices and parking signs previously designated
and listed by inventory with the City Clerk-Treasurer shall remain in effect
unless changed by the Mayor or his designated representative and confirmed by
Council in subsequent municipal orders.

§ 70.17 OBEDIENCE TO SIGNALS.
   (A)    It shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to disobey the
signal of any official traffic-control device placed in accordance with the
provisions of this traffic code or of a traffic barrier or sign erected by any
of the public departments or public utilities of the city, or any electric
signal, gate, or watchman at railroad crossings, unless otherwise directed by a
police officer. However, the type and the right to or necessity for such
barrier or sign shall be approved by the Chief of Police.
   (B)    Such sign, signal, marking, or barrier shall have the same authority
as the personal direction of a police officer.
Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.18 INTERFERENCE WITH SIGNALS.
   No person shall without authority attempt to or in fact alter, deface,
injure, knock down, or remove any official control device or any railroad sign
or signal, or any inscription, shield, or insignia thereon, or any part
thereof.
Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.19 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNALS OR MARKINGS.
   (A)    It shall be unlawful for any person to place, maintain, or display on
or in view of any street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the
movement of traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or interferes with
the effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or
signal. No person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority
permit on any street, any traffic sign or signal bearing any commercial
advertising. Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting any
public department or public utility of the city in any emergency or temporarily
from marking or erecting any traffic barrier or sign whose placing has been
approved by the Chief of Police.
   (B)    Every such prohibited sign, signal, or marking is declared to be a
public nuisance and the Chief of Police is empowered forthwith to remove it or
cause it to be removed.
Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.20 DEFECTIVE DEVICES.
   No provision of this traffic code for which signs are required shall be
enforceable against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation the sign herein required is not in proper position and sufficiently
legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. However, when any
particular section of this traffic code does not state that signs are required,
such section shall be effective without signs being placed to give notice
thereof.
§ 70.21 TEMPORARY CONTROL OF DEVICES.
   In an emergency any police officer may at his discretion disregard traffic-
control lights or signals or established regulations in order to facilitate the
movement of traffic.
§ 70.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   In arriving at realistic penalties for violations of provisions
contained in this chapter, the primary objective has been to establish such
penalties as part of the simplest possible enforcement system. The system has
three features.
      (1)   A mail-in ticket which:
         (a)   Identifies the violator.
         (b)   Lists and identifies violations of the ordinance provisions by
section numbers.
         (c)   States the prescribed fine beside each violation listed.
         (d)   Provides simple instructions on where the ticket is to be mailed
with a check or money order in the amount of the stipulated fine.
         (e)   States a simple procedure to follow if the violator elects to
appear in court to plead his case rather than mail in the fine.
   (B)   Fines.
      (1)   Any person who shall violate a provision of this chapter shall,
upon conviction thereof, be subject to a fine of not less than $50 nor more
than $500. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
      (2)   At the discretion of the enforcement officer, a citation and mail-
in ticket may be used with fines of $50 for the first offense and $100 for each
subsequent offense during a one-year period, which fines shall double if not
paid within five business days after the issuance of a citation and the
violator will be cited to appear before the Kenton District Court. The Court
may impose a fine of $50 to $500, as provided above.
      (3)   For serious violations, the enforcement officer may cite the
offender directly to Kenton District Court without using the citation
procedure.

possession of the vehicle only on payment to the wrecker driver a fee set by
the towing company in return for which the wrecker driver shall issue a receipt

sold to pay the charges after the owner has been notified by certified mail ten
days prior to the time and place of the sale. If the proceeds of the sale of
any vehicle pursuant to this section are insufficient to satisfy accrued
charges for towing, transporting, and storage, the sale and collection of
proceeds shall not constitute a waiver or release of responsibility for payment
of unpaid towing, transporting, and storage charges by the owner or responsible
casualty insurer of the vehicle. This lien shall be subject to prior recorded
liens.

Such notice shall state that if the owner of the vehicle does not respond to
the notice by either paying the fine or by requesting, in writing, a hearing
within seven days of the receipt of the notice, the owner shall be deemed to
have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a violation was
committed shall be considered final. Any person who fails to request a hearing
or pay the fine within seven days shall be deemed to have refused to pay the

hearing before the Hearing Board. Such hearing shall be held no later than 14
days from the date of receipt of the request unless prior to the hearing, the
person requesting such hearing requests an extension of time not to exceed an
additional 14 days. Not less than seven days prior to the date set for the
hearing, the Board shall notify the registered owner of the vehicle of the
date, time and place of the hearing. Any person requesting a hearing who fails
to appear at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have

determine whether a violation was committed. Where it has not been established
that the violation was committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be
entered. Where it has been established that a violation was committed, the
Board shall uphold the citation and order the owner to pay the citation within
seven days. A copy of such order shall be furnished to the owner. Any person
ordered to pay the fine who fails to do so within seven days shall be deemed to
have refused to pay the fine levied by the citation.
   (C)   At the hearing the Board may consider the parking citation and any
other written report made under oath by the officer who issued the citation in
lieu of the officer's personal appearance at the hearing.

Kenton District Court within seven days of the Board's determination. The
appeal shall be initiated by filing a complaint and a copy of the Board's order
in the same manner as any civil action under the Rules of Civil Procedure. The
action shall be tried de novo and the burden shall be upon the city to
establish that a violation occurred. If the court finds that a violation
occurred, the owner shall be ordered to pay to the city all fines, fees, and
penalties occurring as of the date of the judgment. If the court finds that the
violation did not occur, the city shall be ordered to dismiss the citation and
the plaintiff shall be authorized to recover his or her court costs in the

   (B)   Charges. The city in addition to the fines levied for the parking or
traffic offense may by ordinance impose reasonable towing, handling, and
storage charges upon the impounded vehicle.
   (C)   Conditions for release. The city may condition the release of an
impounded vehicle upon the payment of the towing, handling and storage charges
imposed thereon unless the owner or other person entitled to possession
challenges the validity of the impoundment pursuant to §
72.40 of this code. The vehicle may be released to the owner or other person
entitled to possession only upon proof of ownership or right to possession. The
city may require reasonable security, bond or other assurances of
indemnification from a person who is not the registered owner of the vehicle
prior to releasing the vehicle to such person.
(Ord. 2011-2, passed 3-14-11)
§ 72.40 CHALLENGE OF IMPOUNDMENT; HEARINGS AND APPEALS.
   (A)   The owner of a motor vehicle which has been impounded pursuant to this
subchapter or other person entitled to possession may challenge the validity of
such impoundment and request in writing a hearing before the Hearing Board. The
hearing shall be conducted within ten business days of the date of the request,
unless the owner or other person entitled to possession waives the limitation
or the city shows good cause for such delay. The city shall retain possession
of the vehicle pending the hearing, unless the owner or other person claiming
right of possession posts a bond in an amount equal to the fines and fees
accrued as of the date of the hearing request, or $75, whichever is less. If
the owner or person claiming the possession of the vehicle is unable to pay the
amount of the bond, the hearing shall be held within 72 hours of the date the
request for hearing is receiving, unless such person requests or agrees to a
continuance.
   (B)   (1)   No less than five days prior to the date set for the hearing,
the city shall notify the person requesting the hearing of the date, time and
place of the hearing. In the case of a hearing required to be held within 72
hours of the date of the request as provided in division (A) of this section,
the person requesting the hearing shall be informed at the time of his or her
request, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, of the date and time of the
hearing.
      (2)   Any person who refuses or except for good cause fails to appear at
the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have conceded on his
or her and the owner's behalf the validity of the impoundment.
      (3)   At the hearing, after consideration of the evidence, the Board
shall determine whether the impoundment was valid and reasonable. Where it has
not been established that the impoundment was justified, an order releasing the
vehicle shall be entered. All fines and fees paid or amounts posted as bond
because of the impoundment of the vehicle shall be returned. Where it has been
established that the impoundment was justified, the Board shall uphold the
impoundment and condition the release of the vehicle upon payment of all fines
and fees accruing thereto. If bond has been posted as security for release of
the vehicle, said bond shall be forfeited to the city. Any fines or fees in
excess of the amount of the bond posted shall be ordered to be paid by the
owner of the vehicle to the city. The Board shall furnish the owner or person
appearing on the owner's behalf with a copy of its order.
      (4)   The Board may consider a parking citation and any other written
report made under oath by the issuing officer in lieu of the officer's personal
appearance at the hearing.
      (5)   An appeal from the Hearing Board's determination may be made to the
Kenton District Court within seven days of the Board's determination. The
appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a copy of the
Board's order in the same manner as any civil action. The action shall be tried
de novo and the burden shall be on the city to establish that impoundment was
justified. If the court finds that the impoundment was justified, the owner
shall be ordered to pay all fees and fines accruing as of the date of judgment.
If the court finds that the impoundment was not justified, the city shall be
ordered to release the vehicle, if applicable, and to return all fines and fees
paid as a result of the impoundment and the plaintiff shall be authorized to
recover his or her court costs.
      (6)   The judgment of the Kenton District Court may be appealed to the
Kenton Circuit Court in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.

a motor vehicle impounded by the city has not been claimed, or a hearing has
not been requested pursuant to §
72.40 above, notice shall be mailed by certified mail to the registered owner,
if known, and lienholders of record, if any, affording the parties the right
within ten days from the date of notice to claim the vehicle or request a

shall be issued only after a cash deposit sufficient to cover the cost of
restoration has been posted with the Mayor or other proper administrative
officer, conditioned upon prompt and satisfactory refilling of excavations and
restoration of all surfaces disturbed. The minimum amount of cash deposit or
surety bond shall be $5,000, and any surety bond must be in a form and with a

order, rescind the order, or modify the order as deemed appropriate in the Fire
Chief's reasonable judgment. Providing a citation has been issued, an appeal

§ 94.99 PENALTY.
   (A)    In arriving at realistic penalties for violations of provisions
contained in this chapter, the primary objective has been to establish them as
part of the simplest possible enforcement system. The system has these
features.
      (1)    A mail-in ticket which:
         (a)    Identifies the violator.
         (b)    Lists and identifies violations of the ordinance provisions by
section numbers.
         (c)    States the prescribed fine beside each violation listed.
         (d)    Provides simple instructions on where the ticket is to be
mailed with a check or money order in the amount of the stipulated fine.
         (e)    States a simple procedure to follow if the violator elects to
appear in court to plead his case rather than mail in the fine.
      (2)    Use of the above ticket by all department and agency personnel
authorized to enforce the sections of the ordinance.
      (3)    Use for particularly flagrant violations (dumpouts, garbage
spreading from badly-overloaded solid waste containers, debris-strewn property,
and such). This would be in the form of a direct summons to court, with penalty
range substantially above those on the mail-in ticket.
   (B)    Fines.
      (1)    Any person who shall violate a provision of this chapter shall,
upon conviction thereof, be subject to a fine of not less than $50 nor more
than $500. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
      (2)    At the discretion of the enforcement office, a citation and mail-
in ticket may be used as provided above, with fines of $50 for the first
offense and $100 for each subsequent offense during a one year period, which
fines shall double if not paid within five business days after the issuance of
a citation and the violator will be cited to appear before the Kenton District
Court. The Court may impose a fine of $50 to $500, as provided above.
      (3)    For serious violations, the enforcement office may cite the
offender directly to Kenton District Court. Without using the citation
procedure.

(Ord. 2007-12, passed 12-10-07; Am. Ord. 2008-13, passed 12-22-08)
§ 110.04 BUSINESS TAXATION.
   (A)   Levy and imposition. For the purpose of providing funds for the
general operating expenses of the City and the municipal services and functions
provided thereby, and subject to the provisions of KRS 67.750 through 67.795,
and except as provided in §
110.03(D)(3)(c) of this chapter, an Occupational License Fee is hereby levied
and imposed upon everybody engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other businesses in the city, for the privilege of that
engagement.
   (B)   Rate. The Occupational License Fee that is levied and imposed by this
chapter is at the rate of:
      (1)   Employees: 1% of all compensation earned by an employee for labor,
work or services provided in the city.
      (2)   Those not employees: 0.075% of 1% of gross receipts of everybody,
other than employees, who is engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business in the city.
   (C)   Apportionment of gross receipts. Pursuant to the authority of KRS
67.753(4), it is hereby determined that the apportionment provisions of KRS
67.753 do not fairly represent the extent of the engagement in the city of
those, other than employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business both within and outside of the city;
and, accordingly, the following described property factor is hereby added to
the payroll factor and the sales factor provided in KRS 67.753 for the
apportionment of the gross receipts of those, other than employees, who are
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business both
within and outside of the city.
      (1)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or
rented and used in the city during the computation period, and the denominator
of which is the average value of all of the taxpayer's real and tangible
personal property owned or rented and used anywhere during the computation
period. In the determination of the property factor:
         (a)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.
Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental
rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual
rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub-rentals.
         (b)   The average value of property shall be determined by averaging
the values at the beginning and ending of the computation period, but the City
Administrative Officer may require the averaging of monthly values during the
computation period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value
of the taxpayer's property.
      (2)   The proportion of the total gross receipts everywhere of those,
other than employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business both within and outside of the city that are
subject to the Occupational License Fee established by this chapter, shall be
determined by multiplying the total gross receipts thereof everywhere by the
quotient of the total of the payroll factor and the sales factor described in
KRS 67.753 (2) and (3), and the property factor described in the previous §
110.04(C)(1), that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business had in the city during the tax period, divided by the total number of
those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business had in the city during the tax period. The total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the city during the tax period will always be either one, two or three. For
example, if the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business:
         (a)   Had only the sales revenue factor in the city, during the tax
period, without either the property factor or the payroll factor in the city,
the total number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business had in the city during the tax period would be
one; or
         (b)   Had both the sales revenue factor and the payroll factor in the
city, during the tax period, without the property factor in the city, the total
number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business had in the city during the tax period would be two; or
         (c)   Had the sales revenue factor, and the payroll factor, and the
property factor in the city, during the tax period, the total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the city during the tax period would be three.
   (D)   Administrative provisions. The provisions of this chapter shall be
administered and enforced by the City Administrative Officer, who is hereby
authorized to promulgate any additional regulations in regard thereto which are
not inconsistent with any state statute, or any ordinance of the city, or any
executive order of the Mayor.
   (E)   Purpose of occupational license fee. The purpose of the Business
Regulatory License Fees and the Occupational License Fees imposed and levied by
this chapter is to fund the general operating expenses of the city, including,
without limitation, police, fire, emergency medical, public works and
administrative services.
(Ord. 2007-12, passed 12-10-07)
§ 110.05 COLLECTION.
   The Business Regulatory License fees and Occupational License Fees imposed
and levied by this chapter shall be received and collected by the City Clerk/
Tax Collector or by the Fiscal Court of Kenton County, Kentucky, with which the
executive authority of the city is hereby authorized to contract for those
services.
(Ord. 2007-12, passed 12-10-07)
§ 110.06 EXEMPTED ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   Because of the undue burden of administration, no license under this
chapter shall be required of domestic servants employed in private homes.
   (B)   No license shall be required of a minister of religion who has been
ordained in accordance with the ceremonial ritual or discipline of a recognized
church, religious sect or religious organization, to teach and preach its
religious doctrines or to administer its rites in public worship, in the
performance of one or more of those duties. However, it is not intended to
exempt an ordained minister of religion from the necessity of paying a license
fee for work done or services performed in the city in activities not connected

or constructive knowledge on the part of the parent or guardian; that is, the
parent or guardian must actually know about the child violating this section,
or the circumstances must be such that a reasonable prudent parent or guardian
should have known the child was violating this section.
   "MINOR." Any person under the age of 18; or, as may be otherwise phrased,
any person of the age of 17 or under.
   "PARENT." Any person having legal custody of a minor:
      (1)   As a natural or adoptive parent;
      (2)   As a legal guardian;
      (3)   As a person who stands "in loco parentis"; or
      (4)   As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the
court.
   "REMAIN." To stay behind, to tarry, or to stay unnecessarily upon or in any
public assembly, building, place, street, or highway.
   (B)   (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person under the age of 18 to be or
remain in or upon any public assembly, building, place, street, or highway
within the city from 11:00 p.m. on any night until 5:00 a.m. of the following
day.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful for any parent or guardian having legal
custody of a minor to allow such minor to be or remain in or upon a public

not constituting an exception as enumerated in division (c) during the time
period contained in division (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   In the following exceptional case, a minor in or upon any public

countersigned by a parent is in the possession of such minor specifying when,
where, and in what manner the minor will be exercising those First Amendment
rights.
      (4)   In case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent
has communicated to the Dixie Police Authority the facts establishing such
reasonable necessity;

voluntary association; provided that justification indicating the place and
time of termination of the event can be given to any investigating officer of
the Dixie Police Authority;
      (7)   When authorized by executive order issued by the Mayor in cases of
reasonable necessity involving more minors than may reasonably be dealt with on
an individual basis. Such regulation should be issued sufficiently in advance
to permit publicity through news media and through other agencies such as the
schools. The regulation shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the
public assembly, building, place, street, or highway permitted, and the period
of time involved not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for
termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that such regulation is
reasonably necessary. The Mayor shall notify the Dixie Police Authority of the
information;

commission of the offense, whichever is greater.
   (B)    In determining the amount and method of paying a fine for commission
of a felony, the court shall consider, among others, the following factors:
      (1)    The defendant's ability to pay the amount of the fine;
      (2)    The hardship likely to be imposed on the defendant's dependents by
the amount of the fine and the time and method of paying it;

offender may be reincarcerated for the remaining period of his or her
postincarceration supervision.
   (E)   The actual time of release within the maximum established by division
(A) above, or as modified pursuant to KRS 532.070, shall be determined under
procedures established elsewhere by law.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS 82.082 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Crescent Springs, Kentucky, hereby
adopts the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. 2011-3, passed 4-11-11)
§ 155.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2011-3, passed 4-11-11)
§ 155.03 PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (B)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines; streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
      (7)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area; and

§ 155.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. Unless
specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be
interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this
chapter its most reasonable application.
   "A ZONE." Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In "A ZONES," flood waters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   "A1-30 and AE ZONES." Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   "A99 ZONE." That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system
under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   "ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE)." A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. "ACCESSORY STRUCTURES" should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
"ACCESSORY STRUCTURES" are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole
barns, and hay sheds.
   "ACCESSORY USE." A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   "ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE)." Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   "AH ZONE." An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   "AO ZONE." An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) Flood depths are
shown.
   "APPEAL." A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator's ruling on a request for a variance.
   "AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A ZONES." Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   "AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING." A designated AO or AH zone on a community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to
three feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   "B and X ZONES (SHADED)." Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   "BASE FLOOD." A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the "100-YEAR FLOOD"). "BASE FLOOD" is the term
used throughout this chapter.
   "BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)." The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and
AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that
has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   "BASEMENT." That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   "BUILDING." A walled and roofed structure that is principally above ground;

floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   "COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA)." An area that has been determined by
the Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by flood waters that can adversely affect the public health, safety,
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   "COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS)." A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the
Regular Program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures for protection from flooding.
   "CRITICAL FACILITY." Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. "CRITICAL FACILITIES" include, but are not

FIRMs effective before that date. "EXISTING CONSTRUCTION" may also be referred
to as "EXISTING STRUCTURES."
   "EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION." A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site

      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See "MUDSLIDES."
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
   "FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM)." A map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   "FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM)." A map on which the boundaries of the

preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   "FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS." This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state, and/or local regulations, in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   "FLOODPROOFING." Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   "FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE." A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   "FLOODWAY." The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the "REGULATORY FLOODWAY."
   "FLOODWAY FRINGE." That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   "FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION." As related in §
155.43, Variance and appeals procedures, of this chapter, means that the
variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In
examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that every newly
constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of
the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In
addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject
to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance
rates.
   "FREEBOARD." A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. "FREEBOARD" must be applied
not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also
to the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   "FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY." A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   "GOVERNING BODY." The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality
that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
   "HAZARD POTENTIAL." The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The "HAZARD POTENTIAL" classification
of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   "HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE." The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   "HISTORIC STRUCTURE." Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   "INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC)." Increased cost of compliance coverage
provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with state or
community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss
by flood. When a building covered by a standard flood insurance policy under
the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares the building to be
substantially or repetitively damaged, "ICC" will help pay up to $30,000 for
the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building. "ICC"
coverage is available on residential and non-residential buildings (this
category includes public or government buildings, such as schools, libraries,
and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   "KRS 151.250 - PLANS FOR DAMS, LEVEES, ETC. TO BE APPROVED AND PERMIT ISSUED
BY CABINET (ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC PROTECTION CABINET)."
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county, or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,

shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation, or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill, or other obstruction, except
those constructed by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, in the floodplain or
floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such work have
been:
         (a)   Submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction, or improvement; and
         (b)   Approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit issued.
However, the cabinet by administrative regulation may exempt those dams,
embankments, or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to
require approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water
supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filling of, or place a building, barrier, or
obstruction of any sort in, any area in the floodplain or floodway unless plans
and specifications for such work have been submitted to and approved by the
cabinet and a permit issued as required in division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance, or operation of any drainage district, ditch, or
system established for agricultural purposes. However, the cabinet may require
approval prior to construction of structures, dams, embankments, levees,
bridges, fill, or other construction related to agricultural operations that
impact the base flood of a stream.
      (4)   The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.

constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   "LEVEE SYSTEM." A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
For a "LEVEE SYSTEM" to be recognized, the following criteria must be met:
      (1)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
      (2)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state
agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community
participating in the NFIP.
   "LIMITED STORAGE." An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   "LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE." The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support,
or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion

landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure's foundation
system.
   "LOWEST FLOOR." The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area

not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   "MANUFACTURED HOME." A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or
without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required
utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar

letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel.
The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter "A" is not used by FEMA, the letter "B" is the first
revision.)
   "MARKET VALUE." The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. "MARKET VALUE" can be established by independent certified
appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value)
or adjusted assessed values.
   "MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL)." The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the "MSL" is
used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain
as shown on a community's FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988.
   "MITIGATION." Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
"MITIGATION" is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
costs of disaster response and recovery.
   "MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW)." Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a
dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water
on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
"MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW)" may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   "MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT." The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,

of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   "NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP)." The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   "NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD)." As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the

   "OBSTRUCTION." Includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across, or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard, or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   "ONE HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD)." (See "BASE FLOOD.") The flood
that has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the "100-YEAR
FLOOD." Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26% chance of experiencing
such a flood with the SFHA.
   "PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY." A community that voluntarily elects to
participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management
regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.
   "POST-FIRM CONSTRUCTION." Construction or substantial improvement that
started on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community or
after December 31, 1974, whichever is later.

duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   "REGULAR PROGRAM." The phase of a community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   "REGULATORY FLOODWAY." The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
See "BASE FLOOD."
   "REMEDY A VIOLATION." The process by which a community brings a structure or
other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management
regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impact of non-
compliance. Reduced impact may include protecting the structure or other
affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement
provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations,
or reducing state or federal financing exposure with regard to the structure or
other development.
   "REPAIR." The reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing
structure.
   "REPETITIVE LOSS." Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two or
more separate occasions during a ten-year period where the value of damages
equals or exceeds an average of 50% of the current value of the structure,
beginning on the date when the damage first occurred, or four or more flood

to inundation by the base flood and/or flood-related erosion hazards as shown
on a FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AO, or AR.
   "START OF CONSTRUCTION" (includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development). The date a building permit is issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
placement, or other improvement is within 180 days of the permit date. The

§ 155.21 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
155.06, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction.
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork, elevated no lower than two feet
above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used
to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of §
155.21(C).
         (a)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified.
         (b)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be produced.
Title 401 KAR 4:060, Section 5(6)(a), states as a part of the technical
requirements for a state floodplain permit:
      "The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway
boundaries (and thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction
site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced
to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than plus
or minus five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at
those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where
hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section
shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and
at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that
significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional
cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for
making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations."
         (c)   In all other zones, elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction.
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes used for
non-residential purposes) shall be elevated to conform with §
155.21(A), or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
         (a)   Be floodproofed below an elevation two feet above the level of
the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         (b)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
         (c)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood
elevation; or
         (d)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
155.41(B)(1)(c).

155.21(D).
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation two feet above the base flood elevation, and shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood water. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin
1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood water.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other

by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
155.06 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base

capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, "ADVERSELY
AFFECTS" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
155.06, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer §§
155.20 -
155.26. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for
adoption.
      (3)   Notification of other agencies.
         (a)   Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division of Water, and
any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse;
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and
         (c)   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse is maintained.
      (4)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
         (a)   Certification required by §
155.21(A) (lowest floor elevations) as shown on a completed and certified
elevation certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to
mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or
substantially improved structures, in accordance with §
155.41(B)(2);
         (b)   Certification required by §
155.21(B) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown on
a completed and certified floodproofing certificate. Verify and record the
actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or
substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with §
155.41(B)(2);
         (c)   Certification required by §
155.21(C) (elevated structures);
         (d)   Certification of elevation required by §
155.24(A) (subdivision standards);
         (e)   Certification required by §
155.21(E) (floodway encroachments);
         (f)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
not diminished;
         (g)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance; and
         (h)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this
chapter as specified in §§
155.44 and
155.99.
      (5)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
155.43(C)(2).
         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
155.06, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
155.20 -
155.26.
         (c)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
155.21(B), a floodproofing certificate.
         (d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall
be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be open
for public inspection.
      (6)   Right of entry.
         (a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the Administrator has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any
condition or ordinance violation which makes such building, structure, or
premises unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous, the Administrator may enter such
building, structure, or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or
perform any duty imposed upon the Administrator by this chapter.
         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, he or she shall
first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building,
structure, or premises are unoccupied, he or she shall first make a reasonable
effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such
and request entry.
         (c)   If entry is refused, the Administrator shall have recourse to
every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
         (d)   When the Administrator shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or
occupant or any other persons having charge, care, or control of any building,
structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the Administrator for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter.
      (7)   Stop-work orders. Upon notice from the Administrator, work on any
building, structure, or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her agent, or to the
person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be
resumed.
      (8)   Revocation of permits.
         (a)   The Administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued under
the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false statement or
misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or plans on which
the permit or approval was based.
         (b)   The Administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by the
Administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this chapter.
      (9)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the Floodplain
Administrator's staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties, shall
not thereby render himself or herself personally liable, and is hereby relieved
from all personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or
property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his
or her duties. Any suit brought against any officer, employee, or member
because of such act performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision
of this chapter shall be defended by the department of law until the final
termination of the proceedings.
      (10)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A floodplain
construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced construction
within 180 calendar days from the date of its issuance by the Floodplain
Administrator.

§ 155.43 VARIANCE AND APPEALS PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature Of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of variance and appeal board. The City Council shall
establish an Appeal Board consisting of the City Engineer as appointed by the
Mayor.
   (C)   Duties of variance and appeals board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the District Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals and variance procedures. In passing upon such applications,
the Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   The importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   The necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the
case of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "MINIMUM NECESSARY" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the Appeal Board need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Appeal Board believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section, §
155.04, under "public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §
155.43(D)(1) - (D)(11) are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not
create a public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the County Clerk and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition in §
155.04) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

155.99
§ 155.44 VIOLATIONS; ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation
is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set forth in the
citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation, or requesting a
hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the citation is issued
does not respond to the citation within seven days, that person shall be deemed
to have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a violation
occurred shall be considered final.
(Ord. 2011-3, passed 4-11-11) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no less than $100 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and
in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day
such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
