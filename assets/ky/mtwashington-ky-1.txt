repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the original
amendment.

have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or amendment
as the case may be.

meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 34.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)   (1)   Any resident of the Commonwealth shall have the right to inspect
public records. The official custodian may require a written application,
signed by the applicant and with his or her name printed legibly on the
application, describing the records to be inspected. The official custodian may
require the applicant to provide a statement in the written application of the
manner in which the applicant is a resident of the Commonwealth under KRS
61.870(10)(a) to (f).
      (2)   The written application shall be:
         (a)   Hand delivered;
         (b)   Mailed;
         (c)   Sent via facsimile; or
         (d)   Sent via e-mail to the public agency’s official custodian of
public records or his or her designee at the e-mail address designated in the
public agency’s rules and regulations adopted pursuant to KRS 61.876.
      (3)   A public agency shall not require the use of any particular form
for the submission of an open records request, but shall accept for any request
the standardized form developed under KRS 61.876(4). (KRS 61.872(2))
   (B)   All public records shall be open for inspection by any resident of the
Commonwealth, except as otherwise provided by KRS 61.870 to 61.884, and
suitable facilities shall be made available by each public agency for the
exercise of this right. No resident of the Commonwealth shall remove original
copies of public records from the offices of any public agency without the
written permission of the official custodian of the record. (KRS 61.872(1))
   (C)   A resident of the Commonwealth may inspect the public records:
      (1)   During the regular office hours of the public agency; or
      (2)   By receiving copies of the public records from the public agency
through the mail. The public agency shall mail copies of the public records to
a person whose residence or principal place of business is outside the county
in which the public records are located after he or she precisely describes the
public records which are readily available within the public agency. If the
resident of the Commonwealth requesting the public records requests that copies
of the records be mailed, the official custodian shall mail the copies upon
receipt of all fees and the cost of mailing (KRS 61.872(3))
   (D)    The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
34.01.
(KRS 61.874(1))
   (E)    Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(2)(b))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874 (4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874 (5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).
(KRS 61.874(6))
§ 34.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk/Treasurer does not have custody or control of the public
record or records requested, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall so notify the
applicant and shall furnish the name and location of the custodian of the
public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 34.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five (5) day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or
in part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian’s authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
(KRS 61.880)
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.
(KRS 61.880, 61.882)
§ 34.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.

record with the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these rules
and regulations.

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under
this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a
decision is made to take no action. The exemptions provided by this subdivision

nominal sum be placed on deposit with the Mt. Washington Water Company with
approval by the Mayor. The current sum for a meter deposit is two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
   (B)   The two hundred dollar ($200.00) deposit will be maintained in a non-
interest bearing account with the city’s bank of choice. The deposit will
remain with the city while the customer receives water from the city.
   (C)   When a customer discontinues its need for water from the city, a
refund can be made if any and all delinquencies are paid.
   (D)   Meter deposits for water and sewer service are as follows:
      (1)   Security deposit. When an applicant applies for water service with
the Mt. Washington Water Company, it is a requirement the customer makes a two
hundred dollar ($200.00) security deposit. The amount must be paid in full at
the time of the application. If the customer becomes delinquent and the water
service is disconnected due to non-payment, the security deposit may be
transferred from the security deposit account to the customer’s delinquency. If
the customer’s security deposit has been used for non-payment of the account,
the customer has to immediately submit another deposit of two hundred dollars
($200.00) to replenish his escrow account. Water service will not be available
until this deposit is made.
      (2)   Rental facility. A new customer requiring water services at a
property and will be renting from a landlord, the applicant will be required to
include the landlord/owner as a party to the agreement between the city and the
renter. The city maintains via this agreement with the renter, the right to
notify the landlord of any delinquency occurring on the account. The landlord
will be responsible for up to but not more than two (2) months of a renter’s
accumulated non-payments. The renter, relative to the agreement, shall allow
the landlord the right to access, at any time, any information concerning the
payment or non-payment of the water account being provided to the landlord’s
property.
   (E)   In the event a water customer discontinues his account with the city
and that account is delinquent and left unpaid, the following rule will apply.
If this customer wishes to reopen his account with the city and has left his
previous account unpaid, the city will not allow a new account to be opened
until the delinquent account has been paid in full. Even if the applicant is
requesting water service to a completely different dwelling, this same rule
will be followed.

Engineer and/or land surveyor as appropriate and submitted to the City
Representative.
   (B)   Post-Construction Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan. A SWQMP Permit
requires a review and submittal of a Post-Construction Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP). The Post-Construction SWPPP shall include the
following information:
      (1)   A description of the proposed land use including amount of
impervious area, directly connected impervious area, and nature of the
development.
      (2)   Location, dimensions, detailed specifications, and construction
details of all post-construction stormwater quality Best Management Practices
(BMPs), as defined in the city guidance documents.
      (3)   A sequence describing when each post-construction stormwater
quality BMP will be installed.
      (4)   A Long-Term Operation and Maintenance Agreement containing
maintenance guidelines for all post-construction stormwater quality measures to
facilitate their proper long-term function. This Agreement shall be made
available to future parties, including property owners, who will assume
responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the postconstruction
stormwater quality measures.
      (5)   The P-SWPPP shall include provisions for buffers.
         (a)   The Waterway Buffer will be used to define areas where land
disturbance activities shall be permitted, but construction of any building or
structure shall not be permitted.
         (b)   A waterway buffer shall be applied to all waterways serving more
than 25 acres of tributary area or presented on a United State Geological
Survey map as a blue line stream.
         (c)   The waterway buffer shall be defined as the greater of:
            1.   Area contained within a boundary established by the floodplain
boundary as defined by FEMA or city master planning: or
            2.   Where a floodplain is not defined or calculated, the buffer
will be 25-feet on each side from the top of waterway bank as defined by
geomorphic shape (not by the current water surface elevation).
         (d)   The waterway buffer and floodplain may be used for application
of stormwater quality devices. This may only be permitted if erosion prevention
and sediment control, water quality, and cut first fill policies are adequately
addressed as determined by the city according to the provisions of this
chapter.
         (e)   Exemptions are granted so long as, erosion prevention and
sediment control, water quality and cut-fill policies are adequately addressed.
Exemptions shall be granted for:
            1.   Roads and utilities crossing waterways.
            2.   Pedestrian trails and walkways proximate to waterways.
            3.   Other exemptions may be made at the discretion of the city
representative.
      (6)   A Licensed Professional Engineer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky
shall stamp all construction plans and long-term maintenance documentation.
This shall include all proposed improvements or modifications to existing or
new stormwater infrastructure and other related improvements or modifications.
      (7)   The city may require the posting of a maintenance bond to secure
the structural integrity of said facilities as well as the functioning of said
facilities in accordance with the approved Post- Construction SWPPP for a term
of twenty-four (24) months from the date of acceptance of dedication. An
irrevocable letter of credit can be used as the financial assurance in lieu of
a maintenance bond although the contribution shall be equivalent to the amount
that would be estimated for the maintenance bond. The maintenance bond shall be
calculated as twenty percent (20%) of the estimated construction cost and may
be reduced to ten percent (10%) after twelve (12) months if there are no
concerns by the city representative.
   (C)   BMP design requirements and criteria.
      (1)   The city reserves the right to develop or adopt other guidance
documents to serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance
documents distributed by the city should be reviewed and considered when
preparing the Post-Construction SWPPP. These documents may be applied as
standards by which designs are to be prepared and controls implemented.
      (2)   The city shall have authority to implement this chapter by
appropriate regulations, guidance or other related materials. In this regard,
technical, administrative, or procedural matters may be modified as needed to
meet the objectives defined herein, so long as such modifications as to
technical, administrative, or procedural matters are not contrary or beyond the
intent of the objectives defined above.
         (a)   Regulations, guidance or other related materials that may be
given authority by this chapter may include, but are not limited to: Best
Management Practice (BMP) manuals, design regulations and requirements,
submittal checklists, review checklists, inspection checklists, certifications,
stormwater management manuals and operation and maintenance manuals.
         (b)   Materials may include information deemed appropriate by the city
including guidance and specifications for the preparation of grading plans,
selecting environmentally sound practices for managing stormwater, minimum
specifications and requirements, more complete definitions and performance
standards.
         (c)   The above referenced documents may restrict or prevent the use
of specific products, techniques or management practices (that are to be
accepted by the public or are deemed to have a negative impact on public
infrastructure or the MS4) that have been identified as unacceptable for
performance, maintenance or other technically based reasons.
         (d)   Documents referenced above may be updated periodically to
reflect the most current and effective practices and shall be made available to
the public. However, the failure to update the manual shall not relieve any
applicant from the obligation to comply with this chapter, and shall not
prevent the city from imposing the most current and effective practices.
      (3)   The P-SWPPP shall include provisions for stormwater quality BMPs
functioning independently or in combination. Acceptable stormwater quality BMPs
shall be defined by policy and guidance documents as approved by the Stormwater
Board.
      (4)   The P-SWPPP shall include provisions for stormwater quality BMPs
that are designed to treat, filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen,
evapotranspirate, harvest, cool, and reuse stormwater runoff, or otherwise
manage the quality of stormwater runoff from an 80th percentile precipitation
event or 0.61 inches of precipitation.
         (a)   The P-SWPPP shall identify pollutants of concern, based on land
use. Post-construction land use examples may include, but are not limited to,
single family and multi-family residential properties, gas and refueling
stations, truck stops and vehicle service stations, vehicle washing facilities,
commercial business, parking facilities, waste transfer stations, industrial
sites, uncovered material storage areas, soil stockpile and compost processing
facilities, and the like.
         (b)   The P-SWPPP shall demonstrate that target pollutants have been
identified as well as treatment solutions for those pollutants. Target
pollutants to be considered based on land use may include heavy metals,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hydrocarbons, nutrients, temperature,
pathogens, sediment (TSS), trash, chemicals, organic debris, and other
materials on site that could adversely impact water quality.
         (c)   All runoff generated up to and including the 80th percentile
storm event shall be routed through appropriately sized water quality treatment
devices, which intercept and collect target pollutants to prevent them from
leaving the site.
         (d)   Stormwater detention/ retention facilities shall be designed to
address the rate at which flow is released over the entire runoff discharge
period and the volume of discharge over the critical design-storm period if
defined by city stormwater master plans. The outlet structure shall be designed
as a v-notch weir or other multiple stage configurations capable of controlling
the discharge rates for the first flush, two (2)-, ten (10)-, and twenty-five
(25)-year design- storm events. The outlet structure shall be designed to
safely bypass the one hundred (100)-year storm event.
         (e)   Additional requirements may be necessary per KYG20000 for
discharges to waters with an approved Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) or waters
on the Section 303(d) list of impaired waters.
      (5)   Soil bioengineering, "green" and other "soft" slope and stream bank
stabilization methods shall receive preference over rip rap, concrete and other
hard armoring techniques.
      (6)   Retention. Supportive data must be submitted to justify the type of
facility selected. If the facility is designed to retain (volume control) all
or a significant portion of runoff (as opposed to temporarily detain), then
appropriate soils analyses findings shall be submitted to the city. This
submission shall also discuss the impacts the facility will have on local karst
topography as found through a geotechnical investigation of the site. The
facility may be designed to infiltrate runoff to groundwater rather than
transmit it downstream under conditions up to a ten (10)-year storm event. It
must be able to bypass all other storms including one hundred (100)-year event
with a discharge rate equivalent to or less than pre-development conditions
without negatively impacting the one hundred (100)-year floodplain above or
below the site. If data indicates that the facility can not retain a
significant portion of the runoff (95%) then the facility must be designed to
detain runoff.
      (7)   If available, each P-SWPPP shall be evaluated for consistency with
the stormwater master plan or watershed study for the major watershed or
watersheds within which the project site is located. The individual project
evaluation will determine if stormwater quantity and quality management
practices can adequately serve the property and limit impacts to downstream
public and private properties. The presence of a regional facility(s) will be
considered in determining the extent to which stormwater quantity and/or
quality controls will be necessary.
      (8)   The city reserves the right to require superseding or additional
treatment criteria or objectives for specific pollutant(s) as necessary to meet
overall stormwater quality management program objectives or directives under a
watershed improvement or Total Maximum Daily Load (TDML) program as
administered by the USEPA or Commonwealth of Kentucky.
      (9)   On-site BMP Coordination with Regional BMPs.
         (a)   All properties are expected to implement on-site stormwater
quality control measures, but the extent of application may bereduced given the
availability, proximity and nature of regional stormwater quality BMPs.
         (b)   The extent and type of on-site stormwater quality management
practices implemented shall be proportionate to the land use, and proximity to
regional stormwater quality management practices.
   (D)   BMP ownership and easements.
      (1)   Any stormwater management facility or BMP which services individual
property owners shall be privately owned. General routine maintenance
(controlling vegetative growth and removing debris) shall be provided by the
owner(s). The owner shall maintain a perpetual, non- exclusive easement that
allows for access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The
city has the right, but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (2)   Any stormwater management facility or BMP which services an
individual residential subdivision in which the facility or BMP is within
designated open areas or serves as an amenity with an established homeowners
association shall be privately owned and maintained consistent with provisions
of this chapter. The owner shall maintain a perpetual, nonexclusive easement
which allows access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The
city has the right, but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (3)   Any stormwater management facility or BMP which services commercial
and industrial development shall be privately owned and maintained. The owner
shall maintain a perpetual, nonexclusive easement which allows access for
inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The city has the right, but
not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (4)   All regional stormwater management control facilities proposed by
the owners, if approved and accepted by the city for dedication as a public
regional facility, shall be publicly owned and/or maintained. All other
stormwater management control facilities and BMPs shall be privately owned and/
or maintained unless accepted for maintenance by the city.
      (5)   The city may require dedication of privately owned stormwater
facilities, which discharge to the City stormwater system. This shall be at the
approval of the City Council.
   (E)   Regional facilities management.
      (1)   The objective of a regional stormwater management facility, pond or
other device, is to address the stormwater management concerns in a given
watershed with greater economy and efficiency than possible through individual
facilities. The intended result is fewer stormwater management facilities to
maintain in the affected watershed while sustaining efficiency.
      (2)   The city encourages regional stormwater quantity and/or quality
management practices, serving twenty-five (25) to two hundred and fifty (250)
acres of tributary area, which may be consistently and efficiently managed and
maintained. These types of practices will be encouraged in order to replace or
reduce the implementation of on-site stormwater quantity and/or quality
management practices, as determined to be appropriate by the city.
      (3)   Where a regional stormwater management facility has been
established by one (1) or more local governments, or by an authority operating
on behalf of one (1) or more local governments, a development or property may
participate in said program in lieu of runoff control required by this chapter.
This may be permitted provided that:
         (a)   Runoff from the development drains to an approved existing or
proposed public regional stormwater management facility that will be
operational within one (1) year.
         (b)   Participation in the form of contribution of funds, contribution
of land, contribution of stormwater management facility construction work, or a
combination of these, the total value of which shall be in accordance with a
fee schedule adopted by the city.
         (c)   The city finds that the stormwater quality management plans are
in compliance with all other applicable requirements and ordinances.
         (d)   Each fiscal or in-kind contribution from a development owner
participating in a regional stormwater quality management facility shall be
used for acquisition, design, construction or maintenance of one (1) or more
such facilities in the same watershed in which the development is located.
      (4)   Detention facilities may, and are encouraged to, be designed to
serve multiple purposes. For example, runoff may be detained under wet-weather
conditions, but also serve as common or recreational areas during dry weather
conditions. Where multi-purpose facilities are provided, or where flat grades
or poorly draining soils are encountered, provisions for adequate low-flow
stormwater management system may be required. Where the retention/ detention
facility is planned to be used as a lake, pond or stormwater quality management
practice with a permanent pool, water budget calculations shall be performed
and submitted to demonstrate that an adequate permanent pool depth is expected
during dry summer months.
   (F)   Long-term operation and maintenance agreements.
      (1)   Long-term operation and maintenance agreements shall include a
maintenance plan for all stormwater quality BMPs in new development or
redevelopment that require more than general maintenance (e.g. periodic
mowing).
         (a)   The plan will be developed to ensure that the stormwater quality
BMP(s) is (are) kept functional. The maintenance agreement will specify minimum
operation and maintenance requirements and intervals to be performed by the
property owner.
         (b)   The plan shall address schedules for inspections and techniques
for operation and maintenance including vegetation clearing or mowing and
removing accumulated trash, debris, sediment pollutants and other forms of
pollution.
         (c)   The agreement shall be noted on the final plat with the
appropriate notation on the particular lot(s).
         (d)   The agreement shall be included with property ownership title
documents and shall be binding on the owner, its administrators, executors,
assigns, heirs, and any other successors in interest.
         (e)   The format for the Long-Term Operational and Maintenance
Agreement shall be provided through example by the city, or through guidance
documents.
         (f)   Stormwater Detention and Retention Maintenance - Care must be
taken to ensure that any required facilities do not become nuisances or health
hazards. Detention and retention facilities should be designed to require
minimal maintenance, and maintenance expectations must be clearly stated in the
Long-Term Operation and Maintenance Agreement.
         (g)   When a stormwater quality BMP serves more than one (1) parcel, a
home or property owners’ association or binding contract for the purpose of
operation and maintenance is required. The owners association shall be
responsible for operation and maintenance as directed by this chapter.
      (2)   Single entity ownership. Where the permanent stormwater runoff
control facilities are designed to manage runoff from property in a single
entity ownership, the maintenance responsibility for the stormwater control
facilities shall be with the single entity owner.
         (a)   A single entity shall be defined as an association, public or
private corporation, partnership firm, trust, estate or any other legal entity
allowed to own real estate exclusive of an individual lot owner.
         (b)   The stated responsibilities of the entity shall be documented in
the Long-Term Operation and Maintenance Agreement. Terms including owning,
operating and maintaining the facilities shall be submitted with plans in
application for a SWQMP Permit for an adequacy determination. Approval of a
SWQMP shall be conditioned upon the approval of these terms. These terms shall
be in writing, shall be in recordable form, and shall, in addition to any other
terms deemed necessary by the city, contain a provision permitting inspection
at any reasonable time by the city of all facilities deemed critical in the
public welfare.
         (c)   Upon approval of the stormwater quality BMPs by the city, the
facility owner(s) shall demonstrate the ability to guarantee and apply the
financial resources necessary for long-term maintenance requirements. The
funding mechanism shall be in a form approved by the city. The city will only
approve funding mechanism(s) for long-term maintenance responsibilities that
can be demonstrated to be permanent or transferable to another entity with
equivalent longevity.
         (d)   In the event that proposed funding is through an owners
association, then it must be demonstrated that the association may not dissolve
unless long-term operation and maintenance activities are accepted by another
entity with equivalent longevity and adequate funding. Furthermore, the owners
association’s responsibility must be stated in the association’s declaration,
covenants, or by-laws, as appropriate.
         (e)   Unless made specifically clear in the preliminary stages of the
site design and construction plan review procedure, it will be assumed that all
stormwater detention, retention, treatment or storage facilities and/or devices
shall be owned, operated and maintained by a single entity as defined above.
      (3)   City ownership. Where the city has accepted an offer of dedication
of the permanent stormwater quality BMPs, the city shall be responsible for
operation and maintenance.

repair of a facility shall be repaired within twenty-one (21) calendar days of
the completion of those activities which caused the disturbance or damage by
the party that disturbed or damaged the right-of-way or public property. This
time may be extended by the Director or his/her representative upon
demonstration of reasonable cause by the subject party. A party's failure to
take reasonable steps to complete all restoration work due under a surface cut
permit within the time period stated above will result in the cost of the
permit fee required pursuant to §
53.22(D) being re-assessed as an additional fee each time there is a failure to
meet the time limit. Any additional fee(s) shall be assessed at the time of
inspection or re-inspection and payable to the Director upon permit renewal
pursuant to §
53.22(E) in addition to the amount of the original fee(s) provided for in §
53.22(C) and (D) of this chapter.

to stack or bundle conduit where feasible so as to occupy as little space as
possible in the right-of-way. Consistent with state law, or in the absence of
state law the current edition of the National Electrical Safety Code.
      (6)   The minimum clearance of wires and cables above the right-of-way,
and also the placement of underground facilities shall conform to the standards
established by state law, or in the absence of state law the current edition of
the National Electrical Safety Code.
   (C)   Duty to maintain all property in right-of-way. All parties subject to
this chapter must maintain all of their facilities located in the right-of-way
in a manner that promotes the public safety. By way of example, but not
limitation, all facilities, including, but not limited to, poles, towers,
support structures, and manholes, must be maintained in a safe condition at all
times. In the event any facility in the right-of-way is endangering the public
safety, the party responsible for such facility shall take steps to rectify the
situation immediately upon notification and in accordance with §
53.15 .
   (D)   Standards. All parties subject to this chapter shall at all times use
ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods
and devices and utilize due diligence in performing any installation,
construction, maintenance or other work in the right-of-way.
   (E)   Relocation or removal. Pursuant to §
53.18  and consistent with the procedures and criteria contained therein, all
parties subject to this chapter shall, upon the provision of reasonable written
notice of, and at the direction of the Director, promptly relocate or remove
facilities, or rearrange aerial facilities, if required by a tariff, state or
federal law, a franchise agreement with the city, or the Director in exercising
his/her authority under §
53.18 .
   (F)   Other requirements specific to registrants. In addition to the other
requirements set forth herein, each registrant shall use its best efforts to:
      (1)   Cooperate with other registrants and the city for the best, most
efficient, most aesthetic and least obtrusive use of the right-of-way,
consistent with safety, and to minimize traffic and other disruptions including
surface cuts;
      (2)   Participate in such joint planning, construction and advance
notification of right-of-way work, including coordination and consolidation of

well as comply with such other contact and notice protocols as required by this
chapter or as promulgated by the Director pursuant to this chapter;
      (5)   Require that any party performing any work or service in the right-
of-way on behalf of said registrant will comply with all applicable provisions
of this chapter as well any other additional local regulation pertaining to the
performance of such work, and will identify the registrant for whom such
contractor is working. Said registrant shall be responsible and liable
hereunder only to the city for any damage to the right-of-way caused by the
actions of any such subcontractor or others as if said registrant had performed
or failed to perform any such obligation;
      (6)   Comply in all respects with the requirements of KRS 367.4901 et
seq., regarding an excavator's responsibilities pertaining to the location of
facilities; and

§ 53.08 EXISTING FACILITIES.
   Facilities located in the rights-of-way prior to the effective date of this
chapter may remain in the right-of-way and shall not be considered in violation
of this chapter provided the party responsible for such facilities under this
chapter complies with the provisions of this chapter, including the filing of a
registration statement and the payment of any applicable registration or
franchise fee within one hundred twenty (120) days of its effective date. The
registration statement of each party having any facilities within the right-of-
way as of the date this chapter is adopted shall contain a general description
of such registrant's facilities to include the types of services offered and
the locations within the City of Mt. Washington in which such services are
offered and a map of the registrant's general service area within the City of
Mt. Washington. In addition, upon the request of the Division and in order to
assist the Division with implementing or enforcing the provisions of this
chapter, each registrant shall make available for inspection on a timely basis
more detailed information, if available, regarding the location of its
facilities.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.09 REQUIREMENT TO REGISTER AND PAY FEES; REGISTRATION REQUIRED; EFFECT OF
REGISTRATION; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Requirement to register and pay fees. Unless otherwise excepted by
this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any party to install, operate, construct
or maintain any facilities within the right-of-way unless such facilities are
registered with the city by filing the registration statement required herein
and all applicable registration, annual general permit and franchise fees are
paid to the city. Any person who installs, operates, constructs, or maintains
any facilities within the right-of-way before registering such facilities or
obtaining the necessary permits, certificates, letters, or other documentation
required pursuant to this chapter shall not only be required to pay the initial
installation permit fee or surface cut permit fee required pursuant to §
53.22 , but shall also be subject to a reassessment of the installation permit
fee or surface cut permit fee upon discovery that such work has commenced.
   (B)   Registration. Any party who owns any facilities within the right-of-
way or who seeks to occupy the right-of-way to install, construct or maintain
any facilities within the right-of-way shall file a registration statement as
further described herein.

service provider or a lessee shall not be required to register those facilities
it utilizes solely for the purpose of reselling, or those facilities it
utilizes as a lessee.
   (D)   Effect of registration. Registration does not convey legal or
equitable title to the right-of-way nor does it place a registrant in a
position of priority with respect to other registrants. Registration does not
excuse a party from having to obtain a franchise, lease or other agreement, if
otherwise required; or from obtaining any required or necessary agreement with
the city or other party with respect to the placement of facilities on the
city's or another party's facilities.
   (E)   Exceptions. The following types of facilities are not required to be
registered pursuant to this chapter and the party responsible for such
facilities is not otherwise required to comply with the provisions of this
chapter expressly pertaining to registrants. However the party responsible for
such facilities is required to comply with all remaining provisions of this
chapter that are not expressly limited to registrants, unless otherwise
exempted.
      (1)   Newspaper stands;
      (2)   Signage;
      (3)   Facilities associated with sidewalk cafes or the sale of goods or
merchandise;

competitive utility services to customers in the City of Mt. Washington,
provided that such facilities are not used at any future time for the provision
of competitive utility services. The city's division of sanitary sewers is not
exempt from having to register its facilities or from complying with the
remaining provisions of this chapter, unless otherwise exempted.

§ 53.15 EMERGENCIES; POWER TO ORDER REPAIRS.
   (A)   A registrant shall notify the Division by no later than noon the next
business day, via website, facsimile or e-mail, of any event regarding its
facilities already located within the right-of-way that it considers to be an
emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to
respond to an emergency. Within five (5) business days of the discovery of the
emergency, the registrant shall have applied for any necessary permit and
provided the Division with a written notification of said emergency, which
notice shall include, at a minimum the time, date, location and extent of any
excavation or other work performed. If the Division becomes aware of an
emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the Director will attempt to
contact that registrant immediately.
   (B)   If the Division determines that the right-of-way associated with a
surface cut has degraded or caved-in more than one-half (½) inches below grade,
and within two (2) years after any surface cut, it shall notify the party or
parties responsible for making the surface cut of this determination and:
      (1)   In the case of a clear and immediate danger or hazard to vehicular
or pedestrian traffic, the city shall order the party or parties responsible to
take immediate precautionary measures to direct vehicular or pedestrian traffic
around and away from the degradation or cave-in. In addition, the city shall
order the party or parties responsible to make all necessary corrections and
repairs to cure the immediate danger or hazard within five (5) days and perform
any additional work consistent with the issuance of any necessary permit.
      (2)   In all other cases of degradation or cave-in the city shall order
the party or parties responsible to take immediate precautionary measures to
direct vehicular or pedestrian traffic around and away from the degradation or
cave-in, and shall order the party or parties responsible to make all necessary
corrections and repairs within thirty (30) days.
      (3)   In the event the Division orders corrections or repairs and the
party responsible fails to respond to reasonable deadlines set forth in said
order, the Division shall cause the necessary corrections and repairs to be
made, and shall submit a statement for the costs incurred by the city in making
such corrections and repairs to the responsible party, which statement shall
include an additional administrative fee not to exceed five hundred dollars
($500.00). In that event, and if the said statement of costs and fees is not
paid by the said responsible party within forty-five (45) days, the Director
shall suspend the issuance of all future permits to the said responsible party
until such time as the said costs are paid.
      (4)   This section shall not be interpreted to preclude the city from
taking any and all reasonable protective measures with respect to the right-of-
way and the health and safety of the general public, including but not limited
to blocking the general public's access to the area, temporarily repairing the
right-of-way or removing any facility that constitutes an immediate health or
safety concern. The city shall not undertake to repair or remove a facility
unless all other reasonable methods of response to the emergency have been
exercised.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.16 INSURANCE.

policy required by this section. The certificate shall state that the insurance
policy shall not be canceled, materially changed or non-renewed until after
thirty (30) days' notice has been provided to the city; however, insurance may
be canceled and replaced with a policy that continues to meet the requirements
of this section. A registrant may satisfy the insurance requirements and
conditions of this section under a self-insurance plan that is acceptable to
the city. The city reserves the right to impose additional insurance
requirements as part of a franchise agreement.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.17 INDEMNIFICATION; HOLD HARMLESS.
   (A)   Each registrant shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the city,
its officials, boards, members, agents and employees against any and all
claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or
equitable relief, and costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees,
arising from liability or claims of liability for bodily injury or death to
persons or property damage in which the claim arises out of the installation,
construction, repair, maintenance or operation of its facilities, and in the
event of a final judgment being obtained against the city either independently
or jointly with the registrant, the registrant shall pay such judgment with all
costs and hold the city harmless thereon.
   (B)   The city shall notify the registrant in writing within a reasonable
time of receiving notice of any issue it determines may require indemnification
and the registrant shall defend the city at the cost of the registrant.
   (C)   Any registrant owning, operating or installing facilities in the
right-of-way that provide water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone, internet,
cable, video or other utility services, shall prepare and submit to the
Director a master plan. Registrants shall submit an initial master plan no
later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of the
chapter. Thereafter, each such registrant shall submit semi-annually, as
required by the Director, a revised and updated master plan. As used in this
section, the term “MASTER PLAN” refers to a document reflecting any known
future activity planned by the registrant to occur within one (1) year of its
submission that would also require the issuance of a surface cut permit.
   (D)   The Director shall keep all master plans confidential in accordance
with the provisions of the Kentucky Open Records Act, KRS 61.870 et seq., if
directed by the registrant, and shall establish procedures to ensure that said
master plans are utilized and inspected only for the purposes intended by this
chapter.
   (E)   The city shall annually prepare a listing of streets that are to be
repaved in the current city fiscal year, as well as an annual list of all
streets eligible for resurfacing based on their pavement condition. The city
shall provide each registrant with a proposed annual repaving list by no later
than May 1 of each year, and the annual repaving list shall be made available
for public inspection, including posting on the city's web-site by no later
than July 1 of each year, and the annual eligibility list available by no later
than January 15 of each year. These lists shall be kept on file with the
Director for review by the registrants. The final annual repaving list is
contingent upon the approval of the Council.
   (F)   Prior to applying for a surface cut permit, a party shall review the
lists referenced above and shall coordinate, to the extent practicable, with
each registrant, utility and street work shown on such plan to minimize damage
to, and avoid undue disruption and interference with the public use of the
right-of-way.
   (G)   The issue of joint planning and coordination shall be discussed at
each regularly scheduled meeting of the Utility Coordinating Committee pursuant
to this chapter.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.18 INSTALLATION, RELOCATION OR REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Provisions apply unless direct conflict exists. The provisions of this
section shall apply unless they directly conflict with a tariff, state or
federal law, or the provisions of the applicant's franchise agreement with the
city. This section shall not be interpreted to impair the ability of a party
using an annual general permit to perform work under such a permit unless a
public safety concern would arise if such work were to be performed.
   (B)   General application. Upon the written notice of and at the direction
of the Director, a registrant shall relocate or remove facilities, or rearrange
aerial facilities, if required by a tariff, state or federal law, a franchise
agreement with the city, or the Director in exercising his/her authority under
this section.
   (C)   Coordination. Registrants are encouraged to coordinate the
installation, relocation or removal of their facilities with each other in
order to avoid issues with respect to the location of facilities within the
right-of-way.
   (D)   Appeal. Any party aggrieved by a determination of the Director with
respect to the installation, relocation, or removal of a facility may appeal
such decision pursuant to §
53.26 .
   (E)   Installation. 
      (1)   Definition. For purposes of this section, the term “INSTALL”,
“INSTALLED” or “INSTALLATION” shall mean placement of new facilities within the
right-of-way, including the replacement of existing facilities not covered
under an annual general permit and the installation and collocation of small
wireless facilities. An installation requires the issuance of an installation
permit or surface cut permit.
      (2)   Procedure. The Director shall notify the applicant if the Director
determines that a facility may not be installed as requested by the applicant.
Upon determining that a facility may not be installed as requested, the
Director shall provide written notice to the applicant as early as practicable
and in conformity with any specific applicable notice requirement. The notice
shall contain a description of the area affected as well as the reason for the
Director's determination. The Director may issue a permit that is contingent
upon certain condition(s) being fulfilled with respect to the criteria
contained below.
      (3)   Criteria. A decision by the city to deny an installation permit or
surface cut permit application must be based on at least one (1) of the
following criteria:
         (a)   It significantly conflicts with the location of existing
facilities or facilities that are planned or permitted for installation, or
city improvements or facilities that are planned in that area;
         (b)   It significantly conflicts with the timing of other ongoing
activity taking place in the same area of the right-of-way, or with a
previously scheduled activity;
         (c)   It conflicts with the planned grading, re-grading, construction,
reconstruction, widening or altering of any right-of-way or the construction,
reconstruction, repair, maintenance or alteration of a public improvement,
including, but not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and street lights;
         (d)   It conflicts with an approved development plan in that
geographic area that requires all or certain types of facilities to be located
in certain locations, areas, or parts of the right-of-way, or is located in a
high-density utility area;
         (e)   It is an above-ground facility other than a fire hydrant or
other city-owned facility, that because of its size presents significant public
safety concerns or violates guidelines or procedures pertaining to aesthetics
found in §
53.19 or as otherwise duly authorized by Council or the Director;
         (f)   It fails to take reasonable measures to disguise or cover the
facility as required by the city pursuant to guidelines or procedures
pertaining to aesthetics found in §
53.19 or as otherwise duly authorized by Council or the Director;
         (g)   It conflicts with a requirement contained in the applicant's
franchise agreement;
         (h)   It is located in a type of right-of-way, such as a bicycle lane
or path, in which the city has made a determination that facilities are not to
be installed;
         (i)   It would threaten public health, safety, or welfare or otherwise
constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter; or
         (j)   The applicant is not otherwise in material compliance with the
provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Reservation of rights. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
chapter, the city specifically reserves the right to order the removal or
relocation of any facility installed after the effective date of this chapter,
at no cost to the city, for which an installation permit or surface cut permit
was not obtained.
      (5)   Preclusion on cutting newly paved surfaces. If any street is about
to be resurfaced by the city, on advance written notice from the Director
pursuant to this chapter, the registrant shall make any extensions, changes, or
installations of or to its facilities ahead of such activity. Registrant shall
notify Director by July 15 of its desire to perform such extensions, changes,
or installations, and may be allowed up to ninety (90) additional days to
complete the work. If any street is about to be constructed, reconstructed,
widened, altered, or paved by the city, upon receipt of final plans from the
Director, the registrant shall make any extensions, changes, or installations
of or to its facilities ahead of such activity. Depending on the amount of such
extensions, changes, or installations to be performed, the registrant may be
allowed up to one hundred twenty (120) days to complete the work. If the
registrant fails to do such extensions, changes, or installations, it shall be
precluded for a period of one (1) year from disturbing such paving without the
express permission of the Director. The Director shall only grant such
permission upon a sufficient showing by the registrant that undue hardship
would be caused if the registrant were not allowed to disturb the pavement and
that it shall satisfactorily comply with all other relevant provisions of this
chapter, including the requirements contained in §
53.24 (A) pertaining to resurfacing.
   (F)   Relocations. The city shall have the ability to order the relocation
of any facility located within the right-of-way. The city shall not normally
direct the exact location that the facility is to be relocated to, but instead
shall work with the registrant or permittee as part of the permitting process.
There shall be no fee associated with a permit required as a result of a
relocation ordered by the city.
      (1)   Public projects. Whenever the city shall grade, regrade, construct,
reconstruct, widen or alter any right-of-way or shall construct, reconstruct,
repair, maintain or alter a public improvement, including, but not limited to,
storm sewers, sanitary sewers and street lights therein, it shall be the duty
of the registrant, when so ordered by the city, to change, relay and relocate
its facilities in the right-of-way at no cost to the city so as to conform to
the established grade or line of such right-of-way and so as not to interfere
with such public improvements so constructed, reconstructed or altered.
However, notwithstanding the above, if as part of said public improvement the
city orders that facilities that were previously and lawfully located above-
ground, to be relocated to underground, the city shall bear the cost for the
difference in cost between an aerial and underground facility of the same type,
unless an agreement to the contrary is otherwise entered into by the
appropriate parties.
      (2)   Relocation for public safety reasons. If the basis for the city
ordering the relocation of a facility is a public safety concern, the
registrant shall relocate the facility at no cost to the city.
      (3)   Relocations to assist in the placement of other facilities. If the
reason the city is ordering the relocation is to assist in the installation of
facilities by another registrant or permittee, the party seeking to install the
facilities shall bear the costs of said relocation, unless an agreement is
otherwise reached.
      (4)   Relocations where the cost is borne by the city. Notwithstanding
any language in this chapter to the contrary, unless an agreement to the
contrary is otherwise entered into by the appropriate parties, the cost of the
following types of relocations shall be borne by the city:
         (a)   If the reason the city is ordering the relocation is that it has
adopted a plan or policy requiring that facilities be placed underground in
that location, if, at the time the facility was installed, such a plan was not
in place;
         (b)   If, at the time the facility was installed, the location in
which the facility is currently sited was not a part of the right-of-way or was
not otherwise owned or controlled by the city;
         (c)   If the city has already ordered that the facility be relocated
to comply with a public improvement project, the registrant or party has
substantially complied with such order, and the city then orders the registrant
or party to relocate that facility to a different area as part of the same
project; or
         (d)   If the city orders the relocation of a facility to accommodate a
public improvement project and the construction of such project is subsequently
terminated by the Council.
   (G)   Removal.
      (1)   If the city requires a facility that is no longer being used to
provide service, as defined below, to be taken out of the right-of-way, such
removal shall be pursuant to the requirements of this section.
      (2)   Definition. A facility shall be considered to be "no longer in use"
if such facility has not been used to provide service for a period of one (1)
year, or the registrant or the party responsible for the facility has notified
the Director that it no longer intends to use the facility. If the city
determines that a facility is "no longer in use" based on the fact that it has
not been used for a period of more than one (1) year, the responsible party may
petition the Director for a reasonable extension of time based on that party's
desire to use the facility to provide service or to sell or transfer such
facility within a reasonable amount of time. Such an extension of time shall
not be unreasonably withheld.
      (3)   Procedure for notification. Any party discontinuing use of a
facility shall notify the Director in writing of such discontinued use within
thirty (30) days. Said notice shall describe the facilities for which the use
is to be discontinued and include a statement as to whether the registrant
intends to leave the facilities in place for potential future use, remove the
facilities, or abandon the facilities in place. The registrant shall remain
responsible for the maintenance, repair and condition of discontinued
facilities at all times.
      (4)   Criteria and procedure for removal. Upon providing reasonable
advanced written notice to the registrant or other responsible party, the
Director may order the removal of any facility that has been determined to be
"no longer in use", if any of the following arise with respect to that
facility:
         (a)   It significantly conflicts with the location of existing
facilities or facilities that are planned or permitted for installation, or
city improvements or facilities that are planned in that area;
         (b)   It conflicts with the planned grading, re-grading, construction,
reconstruction, widening or altering of any right-of-way or the construction,
reconstruction, repair, maintenance or alteration of a public improvement,
including, but not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and street lights;
         (c)   It conflicts with an approved development plan in that
geographic area that requires all or certain types of facilities to be located
in certain locations, areas, or parts of the right-of-way, or is located in a
high-density utility area;
         (d)   It conflicts with a requirement contained in that party's
franchise agreement;
         (e)   The current location of the facility threatens public health,
safety, or welfare or otherwise constitutes a violation of the provisions of
this chapter; or
         (f)   It is an above-ground facility that has been determined to be
"no longer in use" for a period of more than ninety (90) days.
      (5)   Facilities located underground. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
city shall not order the removal of any underground facility unless the surface
above the facility is currently being, or will be, substantially excavated, or
the presence of that facility causes an emergency or threatens public health,
safety, or welfare. In any event, the removal of such a facility shall be
limited to that portion of the facility that actually presents an issue.
      (6)   Cost of removal. The city shall not normally bear any portion of
the cost of the removal of any facility, unless it is part of a city project
and the costs of such removal are minimal. Depending on the circumstances, the
Director may order that the party responsible for such facility, the party
seeking a permit, or both, bear the costs and the responsibility of such
removal. However, in the event that the facility is being removed to
accommodate the placement of a non-city facility, the cost of such removal
shall be the responsibility of the party or parties applying for the permit, so
long as the existing facility was lawfully installed. The Council may agree,
upon a recommendation from the Director, that the city will share in the costs
of removal or limit the scope of removal based on extenuating circumstances.
      (7)   In the event the registrant or other responsible party elects to
abandon the facility in place and the Council approves such abandonment, the
registrant or party shall convey full title and ownership of such abandoned
facility to the city in consideration of the abandonment in place and without
the need of the city to pay compensation to the registrant. The registrant
shall, however, continue to be responsible for all taxes on such facilities or
other liabilities associated therewith, until the date the same is conveyed to
the city.
      (8)   Should any registrant or other responsible party fail, after
notice, to remove a facility upon the order of the Director as specified in
this section, the city may, at its option and in addition to the imposition of
any other remedies hereunder or in a franchise agreement with that party,
undertake or cause to be undertaken, such necessary removal. The city shall
have no liability for any damage caused by such removal and the registrant or
other responsible party shall be liable to the city for all reasonable costs
incurred by the city in such removal.

§ 53.19 AESTHETIC STANDARDS.
   Unless otherwise approved by the city in order to prevent an effective
prohibition of service in accordance with federal regulations, as applicable,
no person shall locate or maintain a facility, pole, tower, or support
structure, except in accordance with the following design standards:
   (A)   All facilities shall be located and designed so as to minimize visual
impact on surrounding properties and from public right-of-way.
   (B)   All new or replacement poles, towers, or support structures placed in
the right-of-way shall be the same color, shape, material, and general height
as those existing poles or towers adjacent to the location of the new or
replacement pole, tower, or support structure.
   (C)   All coaxial, fiber-optic, or other cabling and wires shall be
contained inside any new or replacement tower, pole, or other support
structure. On existing poles or support structures, or new wooden poles, where
it is impossible to place wiring inside the pole or support structure, all
coaxial, fiber-optic, or other cabling and wires shall be flush-mounted and
covered with a metal, plastic, or similar material matching the color of the
pole or support structure. All coaxial, fiber-optic, or other cabling and wires
shall be contained inside any new tower or pole placed in the right-of-way.
   (D)   No tower shall be placed in the right-of-way within two hundred fifty
(250) feet on the same street of an existing tower. Replacing an existing tower
with a tower, or a lighted pole with another lighted pole housing wireless
facilities, in the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (E)   All new towers and poles should be located on the same side of the
street as existing towers, poles, or support structures. However, this does not
preclude an applicant from locating its wireless facilities on existing lighted
poles under a decommissioning agreement in which the applicant takes ownership
of the lighted pole.
   (F)   The centerline of any new pole or tower shall be aligned with the
centerline of adjacent poles or trees, unless the new structure's height
conflicts with overhead power utility lines. Replacing an existing pole,
support structure, or tower with another pole, support structure, or tower in
the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (G)   All new poles, towers, or facilities proposed to be fronting a
dwelling shall be placed on property lines, unless it would obstruct sight
distance at driveways or other accesses to roadways. In those instances where
placement of a new pole or tower, or facilities on the property line would
obstruct sight distance, the pole or tower, or facilities shall be placed in
such a location as to prevent the obstruction of sight distance at driveways or
other accesses to roadways. Replacing an existing pole, support structure,
tower or facility with a pole, support structure, tower, or facility in the
same location shall not violate this provision.
   (H)   New poles, towers, or facilities shall not be placed in front of store
front windows, walkways, entrances or exits, or in such a way that would impede
deliveries. Replacing an existing pole, support structure, tower, or facility
with a pole, support structure, tower, or facility in the same location shall
not violate this provision.
   (I)   No new poles or towers shall be placed in front of driveways,
entrances, or walkways. Replacing an existing pole, support structure, or tower
with a pole, support structure, or tower in the same location shall not violate
this provision.
   (J)   No applicant shall locate or maintain a pole, support structure,
tower, or equipment associated with a wireless facility, as to interfere with
the health of a tree.
   (K)   In areas where the undergrounding of utilities has occurred but
lighted poles are present, the applicant shall locate its wireless facilities
on existing lighted poles or seek to decommission the lighted pole to replace
it with a lighted pole to house its wireless facilities.
   (L)   If the applicant elects to decommission an existing lighted pole in
order to install a wireless facility in its location, the applicant shall
comply with this chapter, including these aesthetic standards, and any
decommissioning agreement between the applicant, the City of Mt. Washington,
and Kentucky Utilities, or its equivalent.
   (M)   In those locations where the undergrounding of utilities has occurred,
all facilities shall be placed underground.
   (N)   No equipment associated with any facility shall impede, obstruct, or
hinder ADA access, or pedestrian or vehicular access, or block driveways,
entrances, or walkways. The installation of new ground furniture is prohibited.
   (O)   To protect the health and safety of the public from the harms of noise
pollution, all facilities shall have a low noise profile.
   (P)   Within twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date the operator
receives notice thereof, operator shall remove all graffiti on any of its
facilities located in the right-of-way.
   (Q)   All facilities, poles, towers, and support structures shall comply
with such additional design standards as may be set forth in any written
policies or guidelines issued by the city.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.20 POLES, TOWERS, AND SUPPORT STRUCTURES.
   (A)   To the extent possible, registrants shall use existing poles, towers,
support structures, and conduit existing at the time of permitting in
installing their facilities.
   (B)   All poles, towers, support structures, or wire holding structures are
subject to any applicable, duly adopted regulations regarding location, height,
type, or other pertinent aspect, including those found in this chapter.
   (C)   All transmission and distribution structures, poles, towers, support
structures, and other lines and equipment installed or erected by registrant
under this chapter shall be located so as to minimize any interference with the
proper use of the right-of-way with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners whose property adjoins or abuts any affected right-of-way.
Subject to applicable codes, overhead drops shall be as close as possible to
other utility drops in order to concentrate the drops in as small an area as
possible to minimize visual clutter and interference with the use of private
property.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.21 PERMITS REQUIRED; NOTICE OF ACTIVITIES; EXCEPTIONS; DENIALS.
   (A)   Unless otherwise exempted by this chapter, any party performing an
activity within the right-of-way that requires a permit pursuant to this
chapter must obtain the applicable permit prior to the performance of such
activity and pay any applicable permit fee.
      (1)   An annual general permit shall be obtained at the time of the
submission of the registration statement or immediately upon the registrant or
the Division determining that the registrant is performing activity within the
right-of-way that requires the issuance of such a permit. Each time that a
registrant is performing any of the activities listed below, it shall provide
the city written notification. Any work performed without proper written
notification shall constitute work being done without a permit, and as such
subject to the levy of fines.
         (a)   Installation or replacement of wiring on existing towers,
support structures, or poles when the work: (a) necessitates presence in the
right-of-way for more than one (1) day; or (b) involves more than one thousand
(1,000) line feet of cable or wire;
         (b)   Replacement of existing towers, support structures, or poles
when the work:
            1.   Necessitates presence in the right-of-way for more than two
(2) days; or
            2.   Involves more than one thousand (1,000) linear feet of cable
or wire;
         (c)   Excavations of existing facilities from ten (10) to twenty-five
(25) square feet with no street or sidewalk cuts;
         (d)   Installation of new underground lines in trenches of less than
two hundred fifty (250) linear feet with a width of six (6) inches or less and
with no street, curb, apron or sidewalk cuts;
         (e)   Installation of new underground lines in trenches of fifty (50)
linear feet or less with a width of twenty-four (24) inches or less and with no
street, curb, apron or sidewalk cuts;
         (f)   An underground boring larger than three (3) inches in diameter;
or
         (g)   Any underground boring located under a paved street.
   (B)   (1)   Any other activity performed pursuant to an annual general
permit need not be reported to the city unless otherwise required under this
chapter. The notification shall consist of, at a minimum, the name of the
registrant, a general description of the location (by address(es) or street(s))
and the nature or type of the activity performed (e.g. installation of wiring,
boring, tower/support structure/pole replacement, etc.). In the event that the
notification cannot be provided to the city's website said notification may be
provided in writing via e-mail or facsimile transmission.
      (2)   An installation permit or a surface cut permit for the performance
of non-emergency work shall be applied for at least ten (10) days prior to such
planned activity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Director may waive said
time period for good cause shown. The Division must approve, deny, or
conditionally approve a permit application within five (5) business days of the
receipt of the application and in the case of a conditional approval or denial,
state in writing the basis for such determination and what conditions must be
met by the applicant in order to obtain a permit. Any work performed without
proper notification shall constitute work being done without a permit, and as
such subject to the levy of fines.
      (3)   A permit issued pursuant to an emergency shall be applied for no
later than five (5) business days after the discovery of the emergency.
      (4)   All applications for permits shall contain the following
information:
         (a)   The identity and legal status of the applicant (the party to
whom the permit is issued).
         (b)   The name, address and telephone number of the officer, agent or
employee requesting the permit.
         (c)   A description of all activities covered by the permit, and in
the case of an installation permit or a surface cut permit the locations and
estimated dates and times of commencement and completion thereof.
         (d)   The number of all surface cuts covered by the surface cut
permit, and the number of square feet of right-of-way surface to be removed; or
the number of linear feet included in the installation.
      (5)   A single permit may be issued for multiple surface cuts or
installations; provided that no such surface cut or installation covered in a
single permit shall be more than three hundred (300) feet apart.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Director may grant a single permit for
multiple surface cuts or installations that are more than three hundred (300)
feet upon a showing by the permit applicant that such an expansion of activity
shall not significantly affect the Division's ability to efficiently administer
this chapter.
      (6)   Notification of inspections. If the Division knows at the time of
the issuance of the permit that it shall require an inspection(s), it will
notify the permittee that such an inspection(s) is required.
      (7)   Denial or revocation. The Director, in his/her reasonable
discretion, may deny or revoke a permit for failure to satisfy the material
requirements and conditions of this chapter, including but not limited to the
criteria contained in §
53.18 , or if the denial is otherwise necessary to protect the health, safety,
and welfare of the citizens of the City of Mt. Washington. In addition, the
Director may issue a permit that is contingent upon the applicant performing
certain requirements that shall be specified in the permit.
      (8)   Exceptions. Permits are not required to be obtained pursuant to
this chapter if the facilities involved are of the following nature. However,
the party responsible for such facilities is required to comply with all
remaining provisions of this chapter as well as any other chapter that may
apply, unless otherwise exempted.
         (a)   Newspaper stands;
         (b)   Signage;
         (c)   Facilities associated with sidewalk cafes or the sale of goods
or merchandise;
         (d)   Facilities owned by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, including the
University of Kentucky;
         (e)   Facilities installed to provide new development with connections
to utility service and for which the city is provided performance and warranty
surety protection under its land development regulations;
         (f)   Facilities installed by the city that are not used to provide
competitive utility services to customers in the City of Mt. Washington,
provided that such facilities are not used at any future time for the provision
of competitive utility services. The city's division of sanitary sewers is not
exempt from having to obtain permits or from complying with the remaining
provisions of this chapter, unless otherwise exempted.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.22 PERMIT FEES; CREDITS; DISPLAY.
   (A)   Every registrant shall pay the fees associated with permitting under
this chapter annually based upon the provisions of this chapter so as to
equitably assess the impact of the activities performed in the right-of-way by
all registrants and permittees. Franchisees may elect to pay these fees as
either a portion of their franchise fees, or in addition to their franchise
fees, as so allowed by their franchise agreement and consistent with state
laws.
   (B)   Annual general permit. 
      (1)   Unless otherwise prohibited by law, or otherwise exempted, each
registrant that occupies the right-of-way shall obtain an annual general
permit. The type of annual general permit that the registrant shall be required
to obtain shall be based upon the level of both documented and undocumented
maintenance and repair activities the registrant would be anticipated to
perform within the right-of-way; and, as a corollary for such, the extent to
which the registrant's facilities occupied the right-of-way as it existed at
the end of the preceding calendar year. The extent of occupation of the
registrant's facilities shall be determined by measuring the enclosed surface
of the registrant's existing service area as defined by mapping provided
annually by the registrant. Registrants with facilities occupying three hundred
ninety and four-tenths (390.40) acres, the equivalent of ten (10) percent of
the area of the City of Mt. Washington, or less shall pay an annual fee of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) in order to obtain a Type I annual general permit.
Registrants with facilities occupying more than three hundred ninety and four-
tenths (390.40) acres, the equivalent of more than ten (10) percent of the area
of the City of Mt. Washington, shall pay an annual fee of two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500.00) in order to obtain a Type II annual general permit.
Any registrant, as determined by the city, with facilities occupying less than
three hundred ninety and four-tenths (390.40) acres, the equivalent of less
than one tenth of one (0.10) percent of the area of the City of Mt. Washington,
shall be, if so requested, exempt from obtaining an annual general permit and
shall only be required to pay a registration fee annually. Any registrant
exempted from obtaining an annual general permit shall be required to obtain
either a surface cut permit or an installation permit for each and every
occupation of the right-of-way regardless of the scope of the occupation.
Facility installation by a non-registrant for a property owner pursuant to a
contractual agreement shall not require possession of an annual general permit
by either the non-registrant contractor or the property owner.
      (2)   It is the intent of the city that its permit fees shall be in
compliance with the applicable federal law or regulation as it may be amended
from time to time. The annual fee for the annual general permit shall be no
greater than the annual fees presumed reasonable by the Federal Communications
Commission, per small wireless facility installed during the applicable
calendar year. The city reserves the right to require payment of the full
amount if the results of a cost study, or similar administrative review, show
that the additional cost is necessary to recoup the costs of maintaining the
right-of-way, maintaining the structures within the right-of-way, and the
administrative costs associated with the issuance and regulation of annual
general permits and the activities allowed by the permits, or the federal
regulations relating to the "reasonable" governmental fees for small wireless
facilities are amended by the federal government or invalidated by a valid
court order.
   (C)   Installation permit. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, every party
obtaining an installation permit shall pay a fee of one hundred dollars
($100.00) for each installation permit. Any immediately adjoining real property
owner cited to replace, repair, restore, or otherwise maintain any sidewalk,
curb, apron, or utility strip for which that real property owner is legally
responsible shall be exempt from paying and fees for obtaining an installation
permit for these activities. This fee shall be re-assessed in the event that
any work commences without approval as provided in §
53.18(A).
   (D)   Surface cut permit. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, every party
obtaining a surface cut permit shall pay a fee of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) for each surface cut permit. This fee shall be re-assessed each time
a party fails to comply with §
53.07 (B)(4), or in the event that any work commences without approval as
provided in §
53.09 (A).
   (E)   The installation and surface cut permit fees required by this section
shall be paid at the time of application for the permit unless such fees have
been paid in accordance with division (A) of this section.
   (F)   Permit display. Permits issued pursuant to this chapter shall be
conspicuously displayed or otherwise available at all times at the indicated
work site and shall be available for inspection by the Director or other city
employees or officials upon request.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.23 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   In order to ensure performance, each registrant seeking a surface cut permit
must establish a performance bond in favor of the city to be issued by an
entity subject to jurisdiction and venue in the city in an amount to be
determined by the Division, which shall be in effect for and cover all surface
cuts made by that party for a period of two (2) years after the final
inspection and approval of the surface cut by the Division. In no event shall
the amount required by the Division for the performance bond exceed the
reasonable costs of repairing the activity affiliated with the surface cut
permits. This provision shall not apply to the city. In lieu of a performance
bond, the Director may allow the applicant for a surface cut permit to deposit
with the Division an amount appropriate to cover the city's cost of repairing
the surface cut; to be held for a similar period. The city reserves the right
to impose additional security requirements as part of any surface cut permit or
franchise agreement.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.24 PATCHING AND RESTORATION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Standards. Patching and restoration of the right-of-way shall be
performed according to the applicable standards and with the materials
specified by the Division, and at a minimum shall comply with the applicable
standard engineering drawing. The Director shall have the authority to
prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and may do so in written
procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis in accordance with
the criteria listed below. All edges of a surface cut made to a paved street
must be sawed and such surface cuts must be sealed with a sealant approved by
the Division. In addition, the Division must approve all backfill material
utilized. In developing any additional procedures, the Director shall seek
input and participation from the registrants as part of the utility
coordinating committee process. In most instances, the minimum standards will
apply. However, in certain limited instances, the Director may determine that
the minimum standards do not adequately protect the city because of at least
one (1) of the following considerations:
      (1)   The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the right-of-way;
      (2)   The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way;
      (3)   The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way;
      (4)   The remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the
excavation; or
      (5)   The surface cut was made in violation of §
53.18(E)(5).
   (B)   Guarantees. Each party performing excavations pursuant to a permit
required by this chapter guarantees its restoration work and shall maintain it
for two (2) years following its completion. During this period, it shall, upon
notification from the Director, correct all restoration work to the extent
necessary, using the method required by the Director.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.25 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Site inspection. Any party issued a permit pursuant to this chapter
shall make the work-site available to the Division and to all others as
authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution
of and upon completion of the work. No excavation shall be covered until it has
been inspected and approved by the Division, if the Division has given that
party notice of its intent to inspect the excavation. The permittee shall
provide the Division with advance notice of at least one (1) day when the
appropriate portion of the activity is ready for inspection, and if the
Division fails to inspect after being provided such notice, the permittee may
continue to perform the permitted activity. Any excavation that has been
covered without a required approval or inspection shall be uncovered for
inspection at that party's expense, upon request of the Division. If the
construction or restoration does not meet the standards under this chapter, the
Division may order corrective measures.
   (B)   Authority of the Director and the Division. 
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the Division may order the immediate
cessation of any work that it in good faith believes poses a serious threat to
the life, health, safety or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable ordinance,
resolution, regulation, standard, condition, or code. The order shall state
that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the
permit. The permittee shall proceed with the corrective work before undertaking
any additional work under the permit. Within ten (10) days after issuance of
the order, the permittee shall present proof to the Director that the violation
has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required
time, the Director may revoke the permit, or for good cause shown, extend the
period of time allowed for the corrective work to be completed.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.26 APPEAL.
   (A)   Any party that:
      (1)   Has been denied registration after the reconsideration process
provided for in §
53.12;
      (2)   Has been denied a permit or has been issued a conditional permit
for which the party disagrees with certain of the conditions(s) imposed;
      (3)   Is aggrieved by a decision pertaining to installation, relocation,
or removal of a facility pursuant to §
53.18;
      (4)   Has had a permit revoked; or
      (5)   Believes that the fees imposed are invalid;
      May have such action reviewed, upon written request, by the Mayor, or
his/her designee, who shall act within a period of ten (10) days from the
receipt of the written request. The appealing party shall be afforded the
opportunity to be heard and present relevant evidence to the Mayor should it
desire to do so, and the decision by the Mayor, which shall be the final
administrative decision on the request subject to appeal to court, shall be in
writing and provide the basis for the decision.
(Ord. 2020-07, passed 6-8-20)
§ 53.27 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a
registrant and if the vacation does not require the relocation of registrant's
facilities, the city shall reserve, to and for itself and all registrants
having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain
and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such
right-of-way at any time for the purpose of adding additional facilities,
expanding existing service, or replacing, reconstructing, inspecting,
maintaining or repairing the same.

different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or "Go": Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution": when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop": Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed

such signal.
   (F)   "Yield Right-of-Way": Vehicular traffic facing the "Yield Right-of-
Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a "Yield Right-of-Way"
sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a speed in excess
of 15 miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not apply to vehicles
entering an expressway.
   (G)   Lane lights: When land lights are installed over any street for the
purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing yellow lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from
that lane. Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles shall not move
against them. If flashing yellow lights show above a lane, that lane shall be
use only for passing and for left turns unless a sign at such place prohibits
such turn.

   (A)   Any person engaged in the business of storing or towing motor
vehicles, who has complied with the notification requirements of KRS 281.928,
shall have a lien on the motor vehicle and its contents, except as set forth in
KRS 376.275(2), for the applicable and reasonable charges assessed in
accordance with KRS 281.926 and 291.932, as long as it remains in his or her
possession.
   (B)   If, after a period of forty-five (45) days, the applicable and
reasonable charges assessed in accordance with KRS 281.926 and 281.932 have not
been paid, the motor vehicle and its contents, except as set forth in KRS
376.275(2), may be sold to pay the charges after the owner and any lienholder
have been notified by certified mail at the addresses specified in KRS 281.928
(1), ten (10) days prior to the time and place of the sale. If the proceeds of
the sale of any vehicle pursuant to this section are insufficient to satisfy
accrued charges, the sale and collection of proceeds shall not constitute a
waiver or release of responsibility for payment of unpaid charges by the owner
or responsible casualty insurer of the vehicle. A lien on a vehicle under this
division (B) shall be subject to prior recorded liens, unless released by any
existing lienholder pursuant to division (C) below.
   (C)   A lienholder having a prior recorded lien listed on the title issued
by the Commonwealth of Kentucky shall be notified by certified mail within the
first ten (10) days of impoundment in accordance with KRS 281.928. Such
notification, in addition to the requirements of KRS 281.928 shall include the
make, model, license number, vehicle identification number, owner’s name and
last known address, and tentative date of sale for the vehicle, and state that
the towing company or storage facility seeks to obtain a new title free and
clear of any liens, excluding tax liens. If the above-referenced certified
letter is not sent within the ten (10) days by the towing and storage company,
then only ten (10) days of storage may be charged. The lienholder has the right
to take possession of the motor vehicle after showing proof of lien still
enforced, and paying the reasonable or agreed towing and storage charges on the
motor vehicle. If a lienholder does not exercise the right to take possession
of the motor vehicle under this division (C) within forty-five (45) days of
notification, and all lienholders agree in writing, the towing company or
storage facility may obtain a new title under KRS 186A.145 free and clear of
any liens, excluding tax liens. Nothing in this section shall allow the
transfer of a vehicle subject to a lien, except as provided in KRS 186A.190.
   (D)   If there are no lienholders required to be notified under KRS 281.920
to 281.936 and 359.230 and this section, and the owner does not exercise the
right to take possession of the motor vehicle under this section within forty
five (45) days of notification required under KRS 281.928, the towing company
or storage facility may obtain a new title under KRS 186A.145 free and clear of
any liens, excluding tax liens.

indemnification from a person who is not the registered owner of the vehicle
prior to releasing the vehicle to such person.
   (E)   (1)   The owner of a motor vehicle that has been impounded pursuant to
a violation of statute or ordinance, or other person entitled to possession,
may challenge the validity of such impoundment and request in writing a hearing
before the Hearing Board appointed by the mayor. The hearing shall be conducted
within ten business days of the date of the request, unless the owner or other
person entitled to possession waives the limitation or the City of Mt.
Washington shows good cause for such delay. The City of Mt. Washington shall
retain possession of the vehicle pending the hearing, unless the owner or other
person claiming right of possession posts a bond in an amount equal to the
fines and fees accrued as of the date of the hearing request, or $250,
whichever is less. If the owner or person claiming possession of the vehicle is

hearing shall be informed at the time of his or her request, or as soon
thereafter as a practicable, of the date and time of the hearing.
      (3)   Any person who refuses or, except for good cause, fails to appear
at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have conceded on
his or her and the owner’s behalf the validity of the impoundment.
      (4)   At the hearing, after consideration of the evidence, the Hearing
Board shall determine whether the impoundment was valid and reasonable. Where
it has not been established that the impoundment was justified, an order
releasing the vehicle shall be entered. All fines and fees paid or amounts
posted, with the exception of final outstanding citations paid, as bond because
of the impoundment of the vehicle shall be returned. Where it has been
established that the impoundment was justified, the Board shall uphold the
impoundment and condition the release of the vehicle upon payment of all fines
and fees accruing thereto. If bond has been posted as security for release of
the vehicle, said bond shall be forfeited to the City of Mt. Washington. Any
fines or fees in excess of the amount of the bond posted shall be ordered to be
paid by the owner of the vehicle to the City of Mt. Washington. The Hearing
Board shall furnish the owner or person appearing on the owner’s behalf with a
copy of its order.
      (5)   The Hearing Board may consider a parking citation and any other
written report made under oath by the issuing officer in lieu of the officer’s
personal appearance at the hearing.

abate the nuisance. The city may pursue any remedy or combination of remedies
available pursuant to this section, state law or common law in order to abate

substantial progress in correcting or abating the nuisance but unforeseen
circumstances render abatement within the time limits set forth herein
unattainable.

procedures for the enforcement of this section. The procedures shall comply
with all applicable statutes, administrative regulations, or codes.
   (F)   The city shall have a lien against the property for the labor and

responsible officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the
lien and the regularity of the proceedings pursuant to KRS 65.8840 and this
section, and shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk. The lien
shall be notice to all persons from the time of its recording and shall bear
interest thereafter at the rate of 12% per annum until paid. The amount of the
lien shall be added in with the amount of the property owner’s city taxes. The
lien created shall take precedence over all other subsequent liens, except
state, county, school board, and city taxes, and may be enforced by judicial
proceeding.
   (G)   In addition to the remedy prescribed in divisions (E) and (F) of this
section or any other remedy authorized by law, the owner of a property upon
which a lien has been attached pursuant to this section shall be personally

conduct the owner or operator is responsible, or by persons for whose conduct
the owner or operator is not responsible, but by the exercise of reasonable
care ought to have become aware of.

the public health, safety, or welfare, the City Council may by majority vote
suspend the license of any person conducting business upon the premises where
the nuisance exists.

of physical abuse from the paper entitled “Stripclubs According to Strippers:
Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence,” by Kelly Holsopple, Program Director,
Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Based on cases and reports such as these, the Council finds that:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight,
pornographic litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, sometimes
occur at unregulated adult entertainment businesses, especially those which
provide private or semi-private booths, rooms, or cubicles for view films,
videos, or live sexually explicit shows, which acts constitute a public
nuisance and pose a risk to public health through the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases.
      (3)   Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive
land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and
should be separated from other certain uses, such as other sexually oriented
businesses and establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages to minimize
the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent a concentration
of sexually oriented businesses and such uses.
      (4)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which the Council has a substantial government interest in abating and/or
preventing in the future.
      (5)   Sexually oriented business activity tends to attract an undesirable
clientele which discourages neighboring residents from undertaking civic
improvements, causes residents and businesses to move elsewhere and frustrates
attempts to attract new residences and businesses to come into an area, all of
which factors contribute to a diminution of property values and to a general
deterioration of neighborhoods.
      (6)   The concentration of sexually explicit movies and books and sexual
paraphernalia in sexually oriented businesses which also house sexually
explicit movies, as well as hotel rooms rented by the hour to “couples”
afforded free sexually explicit movies in the hotel room, have provided
prostitutes an appealing and visible meeting place to ply their trade and have
created public nuisances in otherwise respectable neighborhoods.
      (7)   Children, the family environment and residential neighborhoods
suffer injury from the deleterious effects and harmful consequences resulting
from the distribution of, and exposure to, certain sexually explicit items and
devices. This is particularly so when such items and devices are permitted to
leave a business’ premises and litter the immediate family environment,
neighborhood and certain areas where children are likely to be.
      (8)   The noise generated by patrons coming and going from sexually
oriented businesses causes a substantial disruption to nearby residents and
modest curtailment of the hours during which entertainment is offered to
patrons of such establishments would afford some relief to persons living in
those nearby residences without significantly interfering with the availability
of adult entertainment.
      (9)   Nationally, there is extensive involvement of organized crime in
the business of adult bookstores and the disclosure of persons who own, as well
as the names of those persons who operate adult bookstores and other sexually
oriented business establishments will aid law enforcement officials in the
enforcement of the federal Racketeer Influences and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO) and the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, among
others, prohibiting the distribution of obscene matter, the use of minors to
distribute obscene matter, the advertising of obscene material, the
distribution of obscene material to minors, promoting the sale of obscenity,
the use of a minor in a sexual performance, the distribution of material
portraying a sexual performance by a minor, the promoting of material
portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the advertising of material
portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the use of minors to distribute
materials portraying a sexual performance by a minor.
      (10)   The Council declares as a matter of public policy that in order to
preserve surrounding neighborhoods, to prevent blight and the deterioration of
the neighborhoods of Mt. Washington, protect property values, promote the
return of residents and businesses to the neighborhoods, protect children from
the deleterious effects of exposure to sexually explicit material and decrease
the incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency, the licensing and regulation
of sexually oriented businesses is a public necessity and is required in the
interest of public health, safety and welfare as well as the economic and
aesthetic well-being of the people.
   (C)   Purposes.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of Mt. Washington, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations
to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses
within Mt. Washington. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose
nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable
access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material;
      (2)   To prevent the unsanitary conditions which exist at certain
sexually oriented businesses and to prevent health risks, including AIDs and
other sexually transmitted diseases, caused by illicit and unlawful sexual
relations in such public establishments;
      (3)   To protect children and the family environment from the deleterious
and harmful effects of exposure to certain sexually explicit items and devices;
and
      (4)   To obtain the identity of persons licensed and to be licensed for
the operation of establishments selling, showing, renting or offering certain
sexually explicit material or entertainment to insure proper identification of
those persons responsible for the operation of such businesses so as to assist
in the proper enforcement of this chapter.
      (5)   It is not the purpose of this chapter to establish community
standards on obscenity nor to permit persons to engage in any activity which is
in violation of law, including but not limited to, state laws pertaining to the
advertising, promotion, distribution or sale of obscene matter or matters
portraying a sexual performance by a minor, or state laws pertaining to the use
of a minor in a sexual performance or promotion of sexual performance by a
minor, or the use of a minor to distribute material portraying sexual
performance by a minor.

to violate the following regulations:
      (1)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for a patron, employee, or

state is otherwise specified herein, a showing of a knowing or reckless mental
state is necessary to establish a violation of a provision of this chapter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the purposes of this chapter, an
act by an employee that constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of
that employee’s license shall be imputed to the sexually oriented business
license for purposes of finding a violation of this chapter, or for purposes of
license denial, suspension, or revocation, only if an officer, director, or
general partner, or a person who managed, supervised, or controlled the
operation of the business premises, knowingly or recklessly allowed such act to
occur on the premises. It shall be a defense to liability that the person to
whom liability is imputed was powerless to prevent the act.

required of the city official under this chapter, and not completed in the time
prescribed, includes approval of a condition necessary for approval by the city

§ 114.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter governs the regulation of rates for basic service and equipment
within the city for any franchisee which has been notified that (a) the city
has been certified to regulate its basic service and equipment rates; and (b)
the city has adopted regulations governing regulation of basic service and
equipment rates. The provisions set forth below are intended to be consistent
with all Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") regulations governing the
regulation of basic service rates and equipment, and the city will regulate and
interpret its rules so that they are consistent with FCC regulations, as if
those regulations were set forth in full herein; the franchisee is prohibited
from engaging in any activity it is prohibited in engaging in under FCC rules,
as if those rules were set forth in full herein. For purposes of these
provisions, the term "basic service" or "basic cable service" has the same
meaning as the term "basic service" at 47 C.F.R. Section 76.901 and the term
"equipment" refers to all equipment and services subject to regulation under 47
C.F.R. Section 76.923.
(Ord. 93-25, passed - - )
§ 114.02 RATE FILING.
   (A)   A franchisee that is notified that its basic service and equipment
rates are subject to regulation must file a submission ("the rate filing")
within thirty (30) days of the notification, justifying its then-existing basic
service and equipment rates. All rates, for all customer classifications must
be justified. Once a franchisee has been so notified by the city that its rates
are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter increase its rates for basic
service or equipment without the prior approval of the city. This requirement
applies in all cases, including with respect to increases in rates announced
prior to the date the operator was notified its rates were subject to
regulation where the increases were not implemented prior to the date of
notice. A franchisee must submit a rate filing to justify any increase in basic
service or equipment rates or any new basic service or equipment rate
(collectively referred to herein as rate increases). An "increase" occurs when
there is an increase in rates or a decrease in program or customer services.
Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for review
at least 30 days in advance of the proposed effective date of the increase.
This requirement does not alter or eliminate any other notice requirement.
   (B)   Every rate filing must be submitted to the City Clerk. A rate filing
shall be considered filed for review on the date the required rate filing and
all required copies are received by the City Clerk. Ten (10) copies of each
rate filing (including all supporting materials) must be submitted. If the
operator claims any part of the filing is proprietary, it shall additionally
file ten (10) copies, which omit the proprietary information.
   (C)   Subject to any FCC regulations governing the burden of proof, a rate
filing submitted by a franchisee must show that the rates the franchisee
proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable. Except as
inconsistent with FCC rules:
      (1)   Every rate filing must clearly state in a covering letter whether
it justifies existing rates; or proposes an increase in rates. The covering
letter must also identify any rate that is derived in whole or in part based
upon cost of service, and identify any pages of the rate filing that contain
information that the franchisee claims is proprietary. It must state whether
any part of the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment or an
alleged increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain a
brief, narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service.
      (2)   The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially.
      (3)   The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms and these
forms must be correctly completed.
      (4)   If different rates are proposed for basic service for different
classes of customers, the filing must show that the classifications and the
differences in the rate charged are reasonable and consistent with federal law.
   (D)   If the franchisee seeks to support a rate based upon a cost of
service, the city will establish a rate that provides the franchisee an
opportunity to recover the reasonable costs associated with providing basic
cable service, including a reasonable profit. An expense or investment is not
presumed reasonable merely because the franchisee has incurred or made it. A
franchisee is not entitled to recover monopoly profits in any form.
   (E)   In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to
provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee
who seeks to justify all or any part of its rates based upon its cost of
service must submit a complete cost of service analysis that shows all expenses
it incurs and all revenues derived from the system, directly or indirectly by
the franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator of the system
within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. Section 522 (4). The cost of service must
identify the accounting level (as that term is used in the FCC's regulations)
at which each expense or revenue identified was aggregated and show clearly how
the expense or revenue was allocated. The franchisee may not include costs at
an accounting level unless it also includes all revenues from that same level
attributable to the system or to a group of systems of which the system serving
the city is a part. The replacement cost of a comparable system must be
identified and supported. The franchisee must identify the name and address of
any entity with which it has a contract, other than a programmer, which derives
revenues from the system, and must state whether and how the revenues of that
entity were included in the cost of service. In addition, the cost of service
shall clearly show the derivation of a proposed charge per channel and the
application of that charge to yield a basic service rate. It must also show and
support the derivation and allocation of any amounts included in the derivation
of the rate for:
      (1)   Operation and maintenance expenses;
      (2)   Administrative and general expenses;
      (3)   Programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs and
copyright fees separately);
      (4)   Costs for PEG access and any institutional network;
      (5)   Franchise fee expenses;
      (6)   Investment in the system and associated depreciation;
      (7)   Other expenses, including federal, state and local taxes, itemized;
and
      (8)   The proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid by
the franchisee.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee is not required to submit
the cost of service specified above for equipment rates, and instead initially
shall complete, submit and support the cost of equipment using applicable FCC
forms. Any cost of service submitted to justify basic service rates must show
that the cost of service does not include equipment costs.
(Ord. 93-25, passed - - )
§ 114.03 RATE FILINGS AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC REVIEW; RECOMMENDATIONS.
   After receiving a rate filing, the City Clerk promptly shall public a notice
that a filing has been received and that, except for those parts which may be
withheld as proprietary, it is available for public review. The notice shall
state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall provide
interested parties seven (7) days to submit written comments on the filing to
the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall submit the comments received and its
recommendations for action to the City Council no later than twenty (20) days
after the filing and shall make those recommendations available for public
inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff
recommendations, but must do so no later than three (3) business days after the
staff recommendations are submitted to the City Council. The response shall be
filed with the City Clerk, and if submitted in a timely fashion, the City Clerk
shall forward a copy to the City Council.
(Ord. 93-25, passed - - )
§ 114.04 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   (A)   If these provisions, or any request for information requires the
production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the
information, however, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is
submitted, a franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its
response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The
request must state the reason why the information should be treated as
proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for
confidentiality will be granted if the city determines that the preponderance
of the evidence shows that non-disclosure is consistent with the provisions of
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552. The city shall place in a
public file for inspection any decision that results in information being
withheld. If the franchisee requests confidentiality and the request is denied,
(1) where the franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the
proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be returned
to it; or (2) the franchisee may seek review within five (5) working days of
the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
   (B)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall weigh the policy
considerations favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited for permitting
inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly
notify the requesting entity and the cable franchisee that submitted the
information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or
condition a request. The requesting party or the franchisee may seek review of
the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be
stayed pending resolution of any appeal.
(Ord. 93-25, passed - - )
§ 114.05 CITY COUNCIL TO APPROVE.
   Within thirty (30) days of the date of the filing, the City Council shall
issue a written order, which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed
rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or
tolling the proposed rate in whole or part. If the City Council tolls the rate
in whole or in part, its written order at a minimum shall explain that it
requires additional time to review the rate filing and state that the
franchisee may cure any deficiency in its filing by submitting a supplementary
filing as provided in §
114.06. With respect to existing rates, tolling means the rates may remain in
effect, subject to refund; with respect to rate changes, tolling means the
portion of the rate change that is tolled may not go into effect.
(Ord. 93-25, passed - - )
§ 114.06 SUPPLEMENTARY FILINGS.
   (A)   If a proposed rate is tolled in whole or in part, the franchisee shall
submit a supplementary filing twenty (20) days from the effective date of the
tolling order, containing corrections, if any, to its filing (including any
required supplement to its cost of service filing) and any response to
information filed by interested parties or to the recommendations of the staff,
or any additional information necessary to support the proposed rate.
Supplementary filings must be filed in accordance with §
114.02.
   (B)   A supplementary filing must also contain such information as the city
directs the franchisee to provide.

increased where the programmer is an affiliate of the franchisee (as defined by
FCC regulations); and, for any contract that has been in effect less than 12

      (4)   A sworn statement by the franchisee's chief financial officer or an
independent, certified accountant stating that he has examined all external
costs (including all programming costs) and has offset against any increase
claimed, the amount of any decreases in external costs, and the amount by which
any increase is external costs was below the GNP-PI, as required by 47 C.F.R.
Section 76.922(d)(2); affirming that the franchisee has only sought to recover
any external cost to the extent that cost exceeded the GNP-PI; and affirming
that the franchisee has not attempted to recover any increase in the cost of
programming purchased by the affiliate except as provided in 47 C.F.R. Section
76.922(d)(2)(vi).
   (D)   Upon receiving the supplementary filing, the City Clerk promptly shall
publish a notice that a filing has been received and that it is available for
public review (except those parts which may be withheld as proprietary). The
notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall
provide interested parties twenty (20) days to submit written comments on the
filing to the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall submit the comments received and
its recommendations for action and the City Council no later than thirty (30)
days prior to the date the City Council must act on the tolling order.
   (E)   The recommendations shall be made available for public inspection. The
franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations,
but must do so no later than ten (10) days after the staff recommendations are
submitted to the City Council. The response shall be filed with the City Clerk,

the City Council.
   (F)   The City Council shall issue a written order, which may be in any
lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the
proposed rate in whole or in part; or allowing the rate to go into effect in
whole or in part, subject to refund. If the City Council issues an order
allowing the rates to go into effect subject to refund, it shall also direct
the franchisee to maintain an accounting in accordance with 47 C.F.R. Section
76.933.
   (G)   The order specified above shall be adopted within ninety (90) days
after the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justifies based on the FCC
benchmark. The order shall be adopted within one hundred fifty (150) days of
the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justified with a cost of service
showing.
(Ord. 93-25, passed - - )
§ 114.07 RATES EFFECTIVE UPON ADOPTION.
   (A)   Any rate order of the City Council shall be issued and effective upon
adoption. Each rate order shall be released to the public and the franchisee.
In any case where the City Council approves, denies, or tolls a rate; orders
that a rate may go into effect subject to refund; or orders refunds or
establishes rates, a public notice shall be published stating the order has
issued and is available for review. Any such order shall be in writing.
   (B)   The City Council may take any steps that it is not prohibited from
taking by federal law to protect the public interest as part of any rate order
or by any other means. By way of illustration and not limitation, it may
require refunds, set rates, and impose forfeitures and penalties directly or
through its delegated representatives, and enforce refund orders. Any order
prescribing a rate must explain why the franchisee's proposed rate was
unreasonable and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However, before
prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to subscribers, the City Council shall
ensure the franchisee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed
rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the City Clerk propose a refund or a
rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation to the franchisee at the time
it is submitted to City Council shall be deemed to provide the franchisee this
notice and the franchisee must comment on the refund or rate in its response to
the recommendations.
   (C)   No order approving or setting a rate using the FCC benchmarks shall be
interpreted to establish the just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every
such rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and
refund to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the
same may be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not
limitation, should the FCC reduce the benchmarks, the City shall have the right
to reduce a franchisee's rates and to require the franchisee to refund any
amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by
federal law.
(Ord. 93-25, passed - - )
§ 114.08 REMEDIAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   A franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including
prospective rate reductions and refunds, within sixty (60) days of the date the
City Council issues an order mandating a remedy.
   (B)   Within ninety (90) days of the date an order mandating a remedy is
issued, a franchisee must file a certification, signed by an authorized
representative of the cable company stating:
      (1)   Whether the franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of
the City Council's order; and
      (2)   Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the
City Council's order; and
      (3)   Showing how refunds (including interest) were calculated and
distributed.
   (C)   It is each franchisee's responsibility to keep books and records of
account so that it can refund any amounts owed to subscribers.
   (D)   It is each franchisee's duty to submit as complete a filing as
possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing that is
incomplete under applicable law shall be treated as an evasion of this chapter.
   (E)   A franchisee and any other entity that has records of revenues or
expenses that are allocated to the franchisee's system must respond to requests
for information from the city by deadlines established by the city. A
franchisee is responsible for ensuring that such other entity responds to the
city's requests.
   (F)   Because federal law limits the time available for an initial response
to a filing by a franchisee, before the order contemplated by §
114.02 issues, the franchisee must be prepared to respond to requests for
information regarding its filing within five (5) days of the date an
information request is mailed to it. The information may include the
information the franchisee would be required to provide as part of any
supplementary filing.
(Ord. 93-25, passed - - )
§ 114.09 CITY CLERK TO ADMINISTER PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The City Clerk shall be responsible for administering the provisions
herein. Without limitation and by way of illustration:
      (1)   The City Clerk shall ensure notices are given to the public and
each franchisee as required herein and by FCC regulations.
      (2)   The City Clerk may submit requests for information to the
franchisee and establish deadlines for response to them, as provided in §
114.08.
      (3)   For good cause, the City Clerk may waive any provision herein or
extend any deadline for filing or response except as to such matters that are
mandatory under FCC regulations.
      (4)   The City Clerk shall rule on any request for confidentiality.
   (B)   The City Clerk shall prepare the recommendations to the City Council
contemplated by §
114.02. If the City Clerk recommends that any increase be denied in whole or in
part, it shall:
      (1)   Propose a rate and explain the basis for its recommendation (it may
propose that rates remain at existing levels); and
      (2)   Recommend whether and on what basis refunds should issue; and
      (3)   Notify the franchisee of its recommendation at the time it is
submitted to the Council.

his sole discretion was made through honest mistake or inadvertence.
   (C)   In no event shall any refund be made for any payment upon any
occupational license tax unless a refund claim is submitted and filed in strict
compliance with the foregoing provisions of this section upon such refund claim
forms or amended return is hereafter shall promulgated by the Collector from
time to time.
(Ord. 99-08, passed 6-14-99)
§ 116.14 COLLECTOR'S DUTIES.
   The Collector shall have the following duties in connection with the
occupational license tax.
   (A)   Keep accurate records of all returns and of all sums received for
occupational license taxes. Such records shall contain the names and addresses
of each taxpayer, the amount of tax paid, and the date taxes were paid. The
nature of installment payments shall be indicated on the records. The Collector
shall keep the original returns on file for a period of not less than three (3)
years after filing.
   (B)   Enforce the provisions of this chapter, all in accordance with any
policies set forth in any ordinance, municipal order, or executive order.
   (C)   Prepare forms and instruments of the returns and payments required by
this chapter. All instructions shall be as clear and short as possible.
   (D)   Examine returns and, for any returns appearing to be incorrect, make
inquiries, adjustments, and investigations in the amount of tax due.
   (E)   When necessary to determine accurate figures for determining the
amount of tax due, examine books, records, papers, or stored computer
information of any taxpayer, provided that each city officer or employee acting
under this chapter shall identify himself and request the information desired.
If the officer or employee is refused admission to any place of business or
refused access to any records or computer information, the Collector shall
leave the premises and request an appropriate court order, with the assistance
of the city attorney, to obtain access to the information needed.
   (F)   The Collector may delegate duties assigned to the Collector in this
chapter to any officer or employee under the Collector's supervision, provided
the Collector shall approve the returns and written instructions.
   (G)   The Collector shall prepare pamphlets for distribution to the public,
clearly explaining the occupational license tax, returns, and payments
required.
   (H)   The Collector shall perform all of the other duties assigned to the
Collector by this chapter.
(Ord. 99-08, passed 6-14-99)
§ 116.15 FAILURE TO FILE RETURN; FAILURE TO PAY; UNDERPAYMENTS.
   The following rules shall apply when an employer fails to file a return,
fails to pay the occupational license taxes withheld when due, or pays less
than the amount due:
   (A)   If the person (employer) liable for withholding the occupational
license tax and filing a return fails to make a return, the Collector shall
prepare an estimate of the amount of occupational license tax due based on the
best information available to the Collector. The Collector may make
investigations to assist in making the estimate. The Collector may consider the
number of employees, the wages or compensation currently paid in the type of
business, the volume of business done and customary commissions or bonuses paid
to employees in the same type of business, and any other relevant matters. The
Collector may estimate the compensation customary in the business or similar
businesses. When the Collector estimates the occupational license taxes, the
amount of interest and late charges provided by this chapter shall be added to
the taxes due. The Collector shall notify the person (employer) of the amount
due. Such notification shall contain a brief description of the method and
estimated figures used in arriving at the estimated tax. Any person or employer
may dispute the amount of the estimated tax by filing in thirty (30) days a
return accompanied by payment of the entire balance due together with the
interest and late charges due. Such return shall be processed like any late
return, and shall establish the occupational license tax liability of the
person (employer) in the place of the estimated amount prepared by the
Collector. The Collector may; however, later determine that the amount shown in
the return is insufficient so there is a deficiency, in the same manner as in
the case of other returns.
   (B)   If the Collector determines, by examining available evidence, that the
amount of occupational license taxes paid over by the employer is less than the
amount required by this chapter, the Collector shall notify the employer of the
deficiency. The Collector may use any of the methods authorized in subparagraph
(A) to determine whether a deficiency exists and to determine the amount of
such deficiency. The Collector shall thereupon notify the employer of the
deficiency. Such notice shall be in writing and shall state not only the amount
of the deficiency but also the methods and estimates used in arriving at the
amount of deficiency. If the employer does not object within thirty (30) days
of receiving such notice, the employer shall be deemed to have accepted the
revised figures for the occupational license tax liability. If the employer
does file written objection within the time specified, the employer shall pay
the fees, together with the penalties and interest, under the protest and may
thereupon pursue administrative and judicial remedies as provided by chapter
and by the Law of the Commonwealth, seek a refund.
   (C)   If the Collector finds that any employer has overpaid, the Collector
shall notify him of his overpayment and shall refund the amount of overpayment
to him.
   (D)   When the Collector notifies any employer of any esteemed amount due,
alleged overpayment, or refund, the Collector shall include in the notice clear
instructions on how, when, and where the employer may protest or appeal the
decision.
   (E)   If an employer or any person, firm, association, or corporation
required by this chapter to pay an occupational license tax or to file a return
for any year shall fail to file a return for any year, such failure shall
constitute a continuing offense against the city and the Collector may process
to estimate and collect the occupational license tax at any time. In all other
cases, no increases shall be made in the employer's occupational license tax
liabilities unless the first notice of such increase is received by the
employer within three (3) years of the time the annual return was first due.
(Ord. 99-08, passed 6-14-99)
Penalty, see § 116.99
§ 116.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, business, or school who shall violate any provision of this
chapter shall be subject to a fine pursuant to §
10.99 of this Code of Ordinances.

(Ord. 2020-06, passed 3-9-20)
§ 117.042 OTHER CONDITIONS.
   In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations required or

   (A)   The City ABC Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage

   (B)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be granted or
renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any property taxes,

charges due to any department of the city at the time of issuing the license,
nor may any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or
property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any of the

Administrator, or any member of the city's staff, or any State ABC
Administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This division is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a City or State ABC
Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a
license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for
appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this

any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or the
administration thereof.
      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of license
would be authorized under local, state, or federal law; or
      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or

117.050.
(Ord. 2020-06, passed 3-9-20)
§ 117.044 FORM OF LICENSE.
   All city licenses shall be in such form as may be provided by the ABC
Administrator, but at the least shall contain:
   (A)   The name and address of the licensee;
   (B)   The number of the license;
   (C)   The type of license;
   (D)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the licensed
premises;
   (E)   The expiration date of the license;

§ 117.045 CHANGE OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the City ABC Administrator within ten (10) days of the change.
   (B)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The
City ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
   (C)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other
business organization herein, the word "change" is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the
corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than ten
percent (10%) of the total ownership or stock shall require a new license.
   (D)   The following information shall be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
      (1)   Name and address;
      (2)   Nature of interest;
      (3)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
      (4)   Date of birth;
      (5)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of
Kentucky. If a resident, indicate when residence was established;
      (6)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license or
in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license under this act;
      (7)   Extent of stock or company ownership;
      (8)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in any
LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license
in any other state or province.
   (E)   This information shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator as a
verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten (10) days of any change of required
information.
(Ord. 2020-06, passed 3-9-20)
§ 117.046 RENEWAL OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Every year, except in the case of the temporary licenses, each
licensee shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the
City ABC Administrator no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of
the license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled,
except where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same
premises licensed during the preceding license period as a result of
construction, act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency or private organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such
acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of
landlord to renew existing lease; provided that said licensee shall file a
written verified statement no less than twenty (20) days from the expiration
date of the license, setting forth these facts, and the City ABC Administrator
is hereby authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license
for a reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the City ABC
Administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from
the expiration date of the former license or licenses. Said license fee shall
not be payable until application is made for the transfer of said license to a
new location.
   (B)   The renewal by the City ABC Administrator of the license shall not be
construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to
such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the licensee.
(Ord. 2020-06, passed 3-9-20)
§ 117.047 LOST OR DESTROYED LICENSE.
   When a license shall be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of the
licensee or his or her agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the original
license shall be issued by the City ABC Administrator after the Administrator
shall have been satisfied as to the facts; provided, however, that the
applicant for said duplicate license shall pay a fee of ten dollars ($10.00)
for the duplicate license.
(Ord. 2020-06, passed 3-9-20)
§ 117.048 REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.

§ 117.049 PROCEEDINGS FOR REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any
law enforcement officer, or of the City ABC Administrator, the City ABC
Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license
granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after
the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered
mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such
proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in
opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or
in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
   (B)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall provide constitutional due process rights to the
City ABC license holder.
   (C)   A decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or suspending a
license may be appealed to Board as provided in KRS 241.200 and KRS 243.550.
   (D)   Within three (3) days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the City ABC Administrator. If the revoked or
suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of
Police, at the request of the City ABC Administrator, shall immediately cause
one of his or her officers to take physical possession of the license and
return it to the City ABC Administrator.
   (E)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee may,
with prior approval of the City ABC Administrator, dispose of and transfer his
or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
   (F)   An appeal from the decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or
suspending a license shall be to the State Board pursuant to §
117.050 below. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay further proceedings
for revocation.
   (G)   If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the City ABC
Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall suspend all
operations authorized under his or her license upon finality and effectiveness
of the order. Upon finality of any final order of the State Board sustaining or
ordering revocation or suspension on appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend
all operations authorized under the suspended or revoked license.

§ 117.050 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeals from the orders of the City ABC Administrator may be taken to

decision or order, being appealed. The notice shall contain a certificate that
a copy of the notice has been served on the City ABC Administrator and shall be
accompanied by a copy of the decision or order being appealed. Matters at issue
shall be heard by the Board as upon an original proceeding. Appeals from

Chapter 13B.

decision, or resulting State Board order, shall become effective or final until
all Board appeals, court appeals, or appeal times shall have been exhausted.
When a Board order becomes final and effective, the City ABC Administrator,
shall enter such orders and take such action as required by the final order of

§ 117.052 REVIEW OF LICENSE; BOOKS, RECORDS AND REPORTS.
   (A)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter shall
provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of
any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant's business income is earned from the sale
of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated
with the applicant's quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide
the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identity each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of
food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for
filing of reports notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the
premises of any licensee and examine the books and records to determine whether
the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this chapter. In the event the
conditions of any license requirement are not met during any quarter, the City
ABC Administrator shall have discretion in determining whether revocation is
appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time
to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee,
the City ABC Administrator may apply an accounting period of at least one (1)
year in determining whether or not the food sale percentage requirement has
been met.
   (B)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain, upon the
licensed premises, adequate books and records of all transactions involved in
the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the City ABC Administrator and such city
employees who may assist the City ABC Administrator in his or her review.
(Ord. 2020-06, passed 3-9-20)
§ 117.053 DORMANCY.
   (A)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after ninety (90) days. Such is the intent of this
section. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her
business interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various
exceptions to the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
   (B)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of
ninety (90) days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth
in division (C) below are proved to the satisfaction of the City ABC
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the City
ABC Administrator.
   (C)   The provisions of division (B) hereof shall not apply to any licensee
who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a license is
issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of
the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency under
power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or
loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the
expiration of ninety (90) days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to
the City ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the fact that the
licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set
forth herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an extension of the
dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect during the license
period or until same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the
fact that no business is transacted during said period; provided, however, no
such license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted thereunder
within twelve (12) months from the date of notice to the City ABC
Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of
his or her sound discretion.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, PURPOSE AND SCOPE
§ 159.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in Kentucky Revised
Statutes delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Mt. Washington, Kentucky,
hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
§ 159.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Mt. Washington are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
§ 159.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
§ 159.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
Special Flood Hazard Area; and,
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area assume
responsibility for their actions.

159.70 , Appeals and Variance Procedures, of this chapter, means that the
variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In
examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every
newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a
part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,

of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   "HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE." The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   "HISTORIC STRUCTURE." Any structure that is:

flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a
dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water
on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A

   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain development permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven (7) days of the date the
citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven (7) days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
   (D)   Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special
exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined according to the penalties set forth in the
Mt. Washington Code of ordinances, in addition, shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
Floodplain Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violation.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 159.35 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Council of the City of Mt. Washington hereby appoints the City
Administrator or his/her designee to administer, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this chapter by granting or denying development permits in
accordance with its provisions, and is herein referred to as the Floodplain
Administrator.
(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
§ 159.36 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
159.16. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of Floodplain
Administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the floodproofing criteria in §
159.51(B) and §
159.53(B);
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to Mean Sea Level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the Community has adopted a regulatory Base Flood Elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and
floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
§ 159.37 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed, authorized
and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this
chapter. The Floodplain Administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this chapter, which are consistent with its spirit and
purpose by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its
provisions. The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator
shall include, but not be limited to the following:

boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
159.70(C)(1);
      (2)   When base flood elevation data and floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
159.16, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
159.50 through
159.56;
      (3)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
159.51(B) a floodproofing certificate;

(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
§ 159.51 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
159.16, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
no lower than     feet (as specified by ordinance) above the base flood
elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall be provided in accordance with
standards of §
159.51 (C).
      (1)   In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified
in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent
grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than     feet (as
specified by ordinance) above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR
(Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a,
states as a part of the technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit:
The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries
(and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where
FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
(0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary, to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated     feet (as specified by ordinance)
above the base flood elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the
elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) shall be certified by a
registered professional engineer or surveyor and verified by the community
building inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and
verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with §
159.51 (A) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be flood proofed to an elevation     feet (as specified by
ordinance) above the level of the base flood elevation so that the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification along with the
design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator;
      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in §
159.51(D).
      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an
elevation     feet (as specified by ordinance) above the base flood elevation,
and, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for
meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the standards of §
159.51 (C).
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed
on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels;
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions or;
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result
of a flood.
         (b)   All such manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than      feet (as
specified by ordinance)above the level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than     feet (as specified by ordinance) above the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for "manufactured
homes".
         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
159.16 , are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If §
159.51(E) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and
other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
159.50 through
159.56.
   (F)   Standards for utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
         (a)   Infiltration of floodwaters into the systems; and
         (b)   Discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
      (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them, or contamination from them during flood.
(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
§ 159.52 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
159.16, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with §
159.16.
(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
§ 159.53 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Article 3,
Section B, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall: Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,

elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely flood proofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
159.51(B).
(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
§ 159.54 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the
elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards;
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available, base flood elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals and
other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided;
and
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure

§ 159.56 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation at the
site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 19-27, passed 12-9-19)
APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 159.70 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council of Mt. Washington to help
protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the
implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so
serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in
the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and
reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly
limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more
detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can
be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations
in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of variance and appeal board. The City Council of Mt.
Washington shall establish a Variance and Appeal Board consisting of.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Variance and Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Variance and Appeal
Board may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky
Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Variance
and Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
existing or proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent use;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Variance and Appeal Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means Mt. Washington City Council need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
159.05  under "PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE"), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
      (5)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §
159.70(D) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of City of Mt. Washington Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and
report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
