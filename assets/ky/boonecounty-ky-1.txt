animal may then be offered for adoption or may be euthanized at the discretion
of the Director of Animal Services. Any person claiming or reclaiming an animal

three days of impoundment, the animal may then continue to be offered for
adoption or may be euthanized at the discretion of the Director of Animal
Services. Any person claiming or reclaiming an animal pursuant to this section
shall pay a reasonable fee for board, administration and medical attention for
such animal during impoundment.

contents of the notice, within three business days of impoundment. If the

14 days from the date of impoundment, before the animal may be adopted or
euthanized at the discretion of the Director of Animal Services.
   (H)   The registered owner shall reclaim the animal within three days of the

reclaiming an animal pursuant to this section shall pay a reasonable fee for
board, administration and medical attention during the impoundment.

lieu of a uniform citation. The misdemeanor notice will stipulate the violation
(s) observed, associated fee and compliance date. The misdemeanor notice shall
allow up to but not to exceed seven days to correct the violation. Should the
violation not be corrected within the allotted time, then the notice shall
serve as a uniform citation and the violating party shall report to the
District Court at the designated court date and time. If the violation is
serious in nature the Animal Control Officer may issue a uniform citation.

Officer to be in immediate danger may be removed from such situation by the
quickest and most reasonable means available.

in the custody of the animal shelter pending a decision by the District Court,

   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DISCARDED ITEMS. This term includes, but is not limited to, items for or
used in recycling, motor vehicles, auto body parts, tires, boats, home

connection with the licensed business of auto body, auto repair, dismantler,
vehicle dealer, and junk or salvage yard, provided that outside storage of
discarded items be within a privacy fence or dumpster area and not on the
grass, or yard.
      (4)   The preceding exceptions shall not authorize the maintenance of a
public or private nuisance as defined by law.
(Ord. 1010.14, passed 8-29-95)
§ 92.02 DISCARDED ITEMS ON PERSON'S OWN PROPERTY PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The Fiscal Court finds that the practice of some property owners
within the unincorporated areas of the county of allowing discarded items to
remain on their property, constitutes a detriment of the welfare and
convenience of the residents of the county, and affects the economic
development of the county. Therefore, it is the public policy of this county to
prohibit the keeping of discarded items on private property within the
unincorporated limits of the county, and such discarded items are hereby
declared to be public nuisances.
   (B)   Any law enforcement officer, including the County Code Enforcement
Officer or his or her designee, who knows, sees or otherwise has knowledge that
a property owner has allowed a discarded item(s) to remain on his or her
property in violation of this chapter, shall issue a citation to such person
ordering him to appear before the District Court.
(Ord. 1010.14, passed 8-29-95) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.03 DISCARDING ITEMS ON PROPERTY OF ANOTHER PROHIBITED.
   No person shall place, leave, deposit or otherwise undertake to dispose of
any discarded item upon any private property or upon any public property or
right-of-way within the county. Any person whose property lies within the
unincorporated areas of the county may file a complaint.
(Ord. 1010.14, passed 8-29-95) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.04 AUTHORITY OF COUNTY TO REMOVE DISCARDED ITEMS; LIEN.
   (A)   If, after a finding by the District Court that any person is in
violation of this chapter, the county, through its enforcement officers, shall
issue to the person by certified mail an order to remove or properly store the
discarded items. The order shall allow the property owner 10 days to remove or
properly store the discarded items. The 10-day period shall commence with the
mailing of the order. Removal or proper storage of the discarded items will be
at the property owners expense.
   (B)   If, after the 10-day period has expired the discarded items have not
been removed or properly stored, and the District Court order has not been
appealed, then the county shall have the authority to enter upon the property
and remove any and all discarded items. The cost to the county of removing the
discarded items shall be at the property owner's expense. The county shall bill
the property owner for the costs, and the property owner shall have 10 days to
pay in full. The 10-day period shall commence with the date of the billing. If
the bill is not paid within 10 days, the county may at its option place a lien
on the real property with the County Clerk, for the actual cost of removal of
the discarded items. The lien shall bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum,
and shall be enforceable as a real property lien under Kentucky law, including
foreclosure for collection on the lien.

§ 97.69 MAINTENANCE OF ENTRANCES.
   (A)   Newly constructed private and commercial entrances. Future maintenance
of the entrances shall not be the responsibility of the Public Works Department
except that the Public Works Department will maintain the entrances from the
edge of the pavement of the roadway to the normal width of the roadway shoulder
only. Maintenance of the remainder of the entrance on the county's right-of-way
will be provided by the property owner. If the Public Works Director, or his or
her designee, requires the replacement of a drainage structure to correct a
drainage problem along the highway, the cost of the replacement may be borne by
the Public Works Department provided the entrance was originally constructed
and maintained to county standards.
   (B)   Old or existing entrances.
      (1)   In specific individual cases where in the judgment of the Director
of Public Works, or his or her designee, a residential or farm entrance is
causing damage to the roadway or danger to the public, the Director of Public
Works, or his or her designee, may authorize maintenance work including
materials to correct the problem.

      (1)   Entrances constructed in violation of this policy shall be
immediately removed where drainage is affected.
      (2)   Private and commercial entrances which have been constructed for
three or more years, without the property owner being informed in writing that
his or her entrance is in violation of the Department of Public Works rules and
regulation, shall be treated as a properly permitted entrance as far as their
maintenance is concerned. This shall not be interpreted to give the property
owner the same rights as a properly permitted entrance as set forth in this
manual.
   (D)   Entrances existing prior to state maintenance. Private and commercial
entrances which were constructed prior to the Director of Public Works
accepting a road into the county maintained system for another agent or agency
shall be considered as properly permitted entrances for all purposes.
   (E)   Public school entrances, exits and pull-offs.
      (1)   The Public Works Department will maintain, at it expenses, that
portion of public school entrances and exits (including all drainage
structures) which are located on the county's right-of-way.
      (2)   Those areas located on the county's right-of-way which have
developed, and will develop in the future as pull-offs, and deceleration and
acceleration lanes by school buses will also be maintained at the expense of
the Public Works Department.
   (F)   Industrial entrances. When improvements are necessary for entrances to
industrial facilities, the cost for them may in some instances be borne by the
Fiscal Court policy on industrial access roads. For these reasons, the Director
of Public Works, or his or her designee, should contact the Fiscal Court to
determine whether the Department of Public Works, or the permittee, shall bear
the resulting costs, whether additional improvements are necessary.
(Ord. 620.11, passed 8-29-95) Penalty, see §
97.99
§ 97.70 DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Any entrance, whether in a rural or urban area, shall not obstruct or
restrict the normal water courses involved, unless suitable provisions are made
therefore. The Director of Public Works shall be satisfied that the type, size
and installation of the drainage features proposed in the application are
adequate for present and foreseeable future requirements and have a reasonable
life span. As to the type of drainage pipe material, the Director of Public
Works shall be governed by the subdivision regulations, latest edition, if
replacement under the maintenance policy would involve a hardship to the
department. If small pipe is used in the normal ditch and with no large fill,
the applicant may make the choice.
   (B)   Requirements for drainage shall be as follows:
      (1)   Necessary drainage structures for an entrance shall not be tied
onto an existing highway drainage structure unless the necessary junction
boxes, manholes, and catch basins are installed by permittee in accordance with
county specifications.
      (2)   The size, length and type of the entrance pipe shall be as required
by the Director of Public Works, but in no case shall be less than 12 inches in
diameter, and not less than 20 feet in length.
      (3)   All entrance pipes, whether of corrugated metal, concrete or
bituminous coated corrugated metal shall meet appropriate department
specifications and requirements. Pipes shall be of sufficient length to prevent
end damage. Sloped box inlet or outlet may be required by the Director of
Public Works.
      (4)   Valley gutters constructed of concrete or bituminous material,
which meet department standards, may be used in lieu of entrance pipe where the
pipe cannot be placed.
      (5)   (a)   Where long lengths of pipe are used, catch basins or clean-
out boxes shall be installed at approximate intervals of not less than 100 feet
based upon pipe diameter of 12 inches.
         (b)   Special consideration may be given to placement of clean-out
boxes at longer intervals for pipe with larger diameters. Boxes shall also be
constructed at all angles in pipe alignment.
      (6)   When necessary, gratings and catch basins must be employed to
intercept and prevent water flowing from the driveway over the sidewalks or
roadway.
      (7)   Utilities are not to be placed in or through existing drainage
conduits.
      (8)   When a fill is to be placed against an existing roadway, the fill
shall be constructed to intersect the outside shoulder edge and slope away from
the road on a 6:1 slope to the ditch flow line or a depth of three feet.
Furthermore, special drainage features as required by the Director of Public
Works, shall be required of the applicant to adequately drain the road bed and
shoulders. This refers to french drains or toe drains in the existing fill.
      (9)   Occasionally, underpavement drainage is provided by sand, crushed
stone or other types of drains from the pavement through the shoulder of the
road. Requests to join the pavement at these existing drainage points must be
accompanied by plans showing the methods proposed to extend these drains so
that their original purpose will be continued. This provision is applicable to
commercial and private entrances.
      (10)   Any proposal to alter or significantly increase a drainage area,
runoff factors or change in any way a drainage structure must be accompanied by
a complete drainage survey (upstream and downstream) based upon a 25-year and
100-year storm with hydraulic analysis of all affected drainage structures in
the area.

§ 97.71 PERMITTEE'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INADEQUATE DOWNSTREAM HIGHWAY DRAINAGE
FACILITIES.
   (A)   In the event that any permittee's development is to create sufficient
additional surface drainage run-off, so that the existing downstream highway
drainage facilities such as cross-drain pipes or culverts, storm drain systems,
entrance pipes open ditches, paved ditches, special channels, or any other
drainage facility within county maintained right-of-way becomes inadequate to
accommodate the increased flow it is then the sole responsibility to the
permittee to:
      (1)   Modify or replace the downstream highway drainage facility or
facilities, in order that the increased flow is adequately accommodated to the
satisfaction of the department; or
      (2)   Provide and on-site retention basin of appropriate capacity and
discharge design to enable the existing downstream highway drainage facilities
to continue to function adequately to the satisfaction of the department.
   (B)   The permittee is required to gather whatever data and submit whatever
plans and information as the Director of Public Works deems necessary in order
to enable him or her to properly evaluate the proposals and ascertain that
highway standards will be met and satisfactory results obtained.
   (C)   Any alterations and measure determined to be necessary are to be a
part of the permittee's commercial access permit, and no permits are to be
issued prior to final agreement on all aspect of this work.
   (D)   It is further specified that the permittee must assume all
responsibility for any law suits or damage claims resulting from alterations
made in the existing highway drainage system.

section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two, and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in

      (3)   For the purpose of divisions (A) through (D) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the Boone County
Finance Department.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the county during the tax period by the business
entity for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation
paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the county based on the time the
individual’s service is performed within the county.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the county during the tax period, and
the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
county if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the united States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
county regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the county and the purchaser is the
United States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the county based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the county and
the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-
producing activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the county, the
business entity may petition the county or the county may require, in respect
to all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable.
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the county; or

allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and outside the county, the
occupational license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation
paid or payable as a result of work done or service performed or rendered
within the county. The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the
percentage which the compensation for work performed or services performed
within the county bears to the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In
order for the county to verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported
percentages under this section, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
(Ord. 07-27, passed 12-18-07)

required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or
required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the county.

listing with the required equivalent information, as determined by the county,
shall be submitted.
   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or before

corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the county, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
section unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for, or
pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes imposed by
this chapter become or became due.
   (I)   Every employee receiving compensation in the county subject to the
occupational license tax shall be personally liable for the tax notwithstanding
the provisions of divisions (G) and (H) of this section. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee,
such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the county each

is required to be made by an employee, can be made quarterly, for the periods
ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year or at any
time the employee wishes to make an estimated payment for the year in which
wages are earned. All occupational license taxes must be received by February

2 form. If for any reason the occupational license taxes due hereunder have not
been withheld by the employer in whole or in part, the employee is required to
file an annual return on or before April 15 with Boone County and to pay the
occupational license tax due on all compensation earned which has not been
subject to withholding, together with any applicable interest and penalty. The
employee shall provide the original copy of the statement furnished to him or
her by his or her employer showing all of the compensation earned by him or hen
wherever employed, during the period for which such return is made. In addition
to the compensation earned by him or her, such return shall show such other
pertinent information as may be required by the Boone County Fiscal Court. Each
person making a return required by this section shall at the time of filing the
appropriate return pay to the Boone County Fiscal Court the amount of license
tax due under this subsection: provided, that any portion of the license tax
deducted by the employer shall be credited on the return and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.

Index = 100, for all items, hereinafter called INDEX), for Cincinnati, Ohio
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of
Labor, for the month of July, 1978, shall be the base month for calculating
adjustments to the fixed annual occupational license tax. If the INDEX for
July, 1979, and for each corresponding month at the end of each year
thereafter, shows a decrease or increase in the purchasing power of the fixed
amount occupational license tax in §
110.03, as compared in each case to the INDEX for the month of July, 1978, the
fixed annual occupational license tax for the succeeding year shall be adjusted
accordingly to the nearest whole dollar.
   (B)   If at the time required for the determination of the occupational
license fee tax adjustment, the INDEX is no longer published or issued, the
Fiscal Court shall use such other index as is then generally recognized and
accepted for similar determinations of purchasing power.

performed outside the county prior to approval of the refund.

§ 110.33 FEDERAL AUDIT PROVISIONS.
   (A)   As soon as practicable after each return is received, the county may

shall be assessed and a notice of assessment mailed to the business entity by
the county within five years from the date the return was filed, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
      (1)   In the case of a failure to file a return or of a fraudulent return
the additional tax may be assessed at any time.
      (2)   In the case of a return where a business entity understates net
profit, or omits an amount properly includable in net profits, or both, which
understatement or omission, or both, is in excess of 25% of the amount of net
profit stated in the return, the additional tax may be assessed at any time
within six years after the return was filed.
      (3)   In the case of an assessment of additional tax relating directly to
adjustments resulting from a final determination of a federal audit, the
additional tax may be assessed before the expiration of the times provided in
this section, or six months from the date the county receives the final
determination of the federal audit from the business entity, whichever is
later.
      The times provided in this section may be extended by agreement between
the business entity and the county. For the purposes of this subsection, a
return filed before the last day prescribed by law for filing the return shall
be considered as filed on the last day. Any extension granted for filing the
return shall also be considered as extending the last day prescribed by law for
filing the return.

110.33 has been extended by an agreement between the business entity and the
county, the limitation contained in this section shall be extended accordingly.

resulting from a federal audit, the business entity shall file a claim for
refund or credit within the time provided for in this section or six months
from the conclusion of the federal audit, whichever is later.

of the affairs of any person, or information regarding the tax schedules,
returns, or reports required to be filed with the county or other proper
officer, or any information produced by a hearing or investigation, insofar as
the information may have to do with the affairs of the person's business. This
prohibition does not extend to information required in prosecutions for making

records of the Kentucky Department of Revenue and maintains the privileged
character of the information so furnished. Provided, further, that the county
may publish statistics based on such information in such a manner as not to
reveal data respecting net profits or compensation of any person or business
entity.
   (C)   In addition, the county is empowered to execute similar reciprocity
agreements as described in division (B) of this section with any other taxing
entity, should there be a need for exchange of information in order to effect

§ 111.01 RATIONALE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of the citizens of the county, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses within the county. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
   (B)   Findings and rationale. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to
the Fiscal Court, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions

and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; Sex Store Statistics and Articles; and
Law Enforcement and Private Investigator Affidavits (Adult Cabarets in Forest
Park, GA and Sandy Springs, GA), the Fiscal Court finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter,
and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and
lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects.
      (2)   Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive
land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and
should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the
secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary
concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
      (3)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which the county has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects
is the county's rationale for this chapter. Additionally, the county's interest
in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future
secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that
may locate in the county. The county finds that the cases and documentation
relied on in this chapter are reasonably believed to be relevant to said
secondary effects. The county hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated
findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports
related to such secondary effects.

      AGENCY. The Finance Department of the County of Boone, Kentucky.

(Ord. 2021-13, passed 5-25-21)
§ 116.02 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS.
   In accordance with the Act, the county hereby makes the following findings
and determinations with respect to the Old Lexington Pike Local Development
Area:
   (A)   The Old Lexington Pike Local Development Area consists of a contiguous
tract of land that is less than 1,000 acres. The actual size of the Old
Lexington Pike Local Development Area is approximately 70.22 acres;
   (B)   The Old Lexington Pike Local Development Area constitutes undeveloped
land that is being developed; and
   (C)   The establishment of the Old Lexington Pike Local Development Area
will not cause the assessed taxable value of real property within the Old
Lexington Pike Local Development Area and within all "development areas" and
"local development areas" established by the county (as those terms are defined
in the Act) to exceed 20% of the total assessed taxable value of real property
within the county. The assessed value of taxable real property within the Old
Lexington Pike Local Development Area for calendar year 2020 was $165,710 and
the total assessed value of taxable real property within the county for the
calendar year 2020 exceeds $12,900,000,000. While the county has established
other local development areas, in addition to the Old Lexington Pike Local
Development Area, the total taxable real property assessment within all such
areas, including the Old Lexington Pike Local Development Area, is just a very
small percentage of the county's total taxable real property assessment.
Therefore, the assessed value of taxable real property within the Old Lexington
Pike Local Development Area is significantly less than 20% of the assessed

§ 117.02 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS.
   In accordance with the Act, the county hereby makes the following findings
and determinations with respect to the CVG7 Airpark Logistics Local Development
Area:
   (A)   The CVG7 Airpark Logistics Local Development Area consists of a
contiguous tract of land that is less than 1,000 acres. The actual size of the
CVG7 Airpark Logistics Local Development Area is approximately 61 acres;
   (B)   The CVG7 Airpark Logistics Local Development Area constitutes
undeveloped land that is being developed; and
   (C)   The establishment of the CVG7 Airpark Logistics Local Development Area
will not cause the assessed taxable value of real property within the CVG7
Airpark Logistics Local Development Area and within all "development areas" and
"local development areas" established by the county (as those terms are defined
in the Act) to exceed 20% of the total assessed taxable value of real property
within the county. The assessed value of taxable real property within the CVG7
Airpark Logistics Local Development Area for calendar year 2020 was $0.00 and
the total assessed value of taxable real property within the county for the
calendar year 2020 was $13,169,000,000. While the county has established other
local development areas, in additional to the CVG7 Airpark Logistics Local
Development Area, the total taxable real property assessment within all such
areas, including the CVG7 Airpark Logistics Local Development Area is just a
very small percentage of the county's total taxable real property assessment.
Therefore, the assessed value of taxable real property within the CVG7 Airpark
Logistics Local Development Area is significantly less than 20% of the assessed
value of taxable real property within the county.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has, in KRS 67.083(3)(i) and
67.084, delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Fiscal Court hereby adopts the following floodplain
management chapter, as follows.
(Ord. 07-13, passed 5-15-07)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 07-13, passed 5-15-07)
§ 151.03 PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to
flooding by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located
in special flood hazard areas;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of special flood hazard areas or other flood-prone areas in such a
manner as to minimize future flood-blighted areas caused by flooding;
      (7)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 07-13, passed 5-15-07)
§ 151.04 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the principle
source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both.
In A ZONES, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base flood
elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use, which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is NEW CONSTRUCTION.
   A1-30 AND AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100- year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator's ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1 — A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AND AR/A ZONES. Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   A99 ZONE. That part of the special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood which is to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood
protection system under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three
feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood, which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the 100-year flood). BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/Al-A30, AR/AH, and AR/
AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a
1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for STRUCTURE.
   C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES. Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular
program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. Critical facilities include, but are not
limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to
avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and
equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,

the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized
rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date
of the initial FIRM.
   ENCLOSURE. That portion of a structure below the base flood elevation (BFE)
used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the
structure.
   ENCROACHMENT. The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth,
fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a
floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to
as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the county based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FIVE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD. The flood that has a 0.2% chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to
low risk of flooding.
   FLOOD, FLOODING, or FLOOD WATER:
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (mudflows). See MUDSLIDES.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or B by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing
flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), and/or the Flood Boundary
Floodway Map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by floodwaters from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a nonresidential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
151.46, the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the Fiscal Court will consider the fact
that every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of
the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may
incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long- term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, such as the county or municipality
that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (such as safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).  INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE coverage
provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with state or
community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss
by flood. When a building covered by a standard flood insurance policy under
the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares the building to be
substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the
cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building. ICC coverage is
available on residential and nonresidential buildings (this category includes
public or government buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal
buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE 151.250. Plans for dams, levees, and the like to be
approved and permit issued by the Cabinet (Environmental and Public Protection
Cabinet):
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the Cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the Cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to require
approval by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the Cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the Cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
Cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.

Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's include the following
categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in designated special flood
hazard areas. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a
specific property is not located in special flood hazard areas.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION — FILL (LOMR F). A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA.
   LEVEE. A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. For a
LEVEE SYSTEM to be recognized, the following criteria must be met:
      (1)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
      (2)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state
agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community
participating in the NFIP.

landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure's foundation
system.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The LOWEST FLOOR of the lowest enclosed area, including the
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking

   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this ordinance
and/or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.

determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060,
Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for a state
floodplain permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining
floodway boundaries(and thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed
construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall
be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no
more than five-tenths of a foot. Cross section elevations shall be taken at
those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where
hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section
shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and
at the locations specified by the Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that
significant flood damage will not occur, the Cabinet may require additional
cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for
making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure
(including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
elevation; or
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
151.20(A)(1)(c).
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) of this
section.
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood
elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to
allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be

         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (3)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   Lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than
one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than
36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.

and insured in accordance with the state's motor vehicle regulations, is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within special flood hazard areas established in §
151.06, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this subchapter.
   (F)   Standards for utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
         (a)   Infiltration of floodwaters into the systems; and
         (b)   Discharge from the systems into floodwaters.

§ 151.32 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.06, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with §
151.06.
(Ord. 07-13, passed 5-15-07) Penalty, see §
151.99

§ 151.34 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.06, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas.
   (B)   These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of
one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water
path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall:
         (a)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
         (b)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as stated in §
151.31(B).

exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the special flood hazard areas (for example, where there appears
to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the
Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
151.46(C)(2);
         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
151.06, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
151.30 through
151.36;
         (c)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
151.31(B) a floodproofing certificate;
         (d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall
be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be open
for public inspection.
      (6)   Right of entry.
         (a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the Administrator has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any
condition or chapter violation which makes such building, structure or premises
unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Administrator may enter such building,
structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or perform
any duty imposed upon the Administrator by this chapter.
         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, he or she shall
first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building,
structure, or premises are unoccupied, he or she shall first make a reasonable
effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such
request entry.
         (c)   If entry is refused, the Administrator shall have recourse to
every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
         (d)   When the Administrator shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or
occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building,
structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the Administrator for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter.
      (7)   Stop-work orders. Upon notice from the Administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her agent, or to the
person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be
resumed.
      (8)   Revocation of permits.
         (a)   The Administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued under
the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false statement or
misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or plans on which
the permit or approval was based.
         (b)   The Administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by the
Administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this chapter.
      (9)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the Floodplain
Administrator's staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties, shall
not thereby render himself or herself personally liable, and is hereby relieved
from all personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or
property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his
or her duties. Any suit brought against any officer, employee, or member
because of such act performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision
of this chapter shall be defended by the department of law until the final
termination of the proceedings.
      (10)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A floodplain
construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced construction
within 180 calendar days from the date of its issuance by the Floodplain
Administrator.
(Ord. 07-13, passed 5-15-07)
§ 151.46 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the Fiscal Court to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of variance and appeal board. The Fiscal Court of shall
establish an Appeals Board consisting of the current members of the Building
Inspector Appeals Board.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local district court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeals Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeals Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the Fiscal Court need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Fiscal Court believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in §
151.04); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
151.04 under public safety and nuisance), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in §
151.04) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of divisions (1)
through (5) above are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the County Clerk and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition) upon determination that
the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
