         (a)   If it is determined that supplies or services are to be
purchased by noncompetitive negotiations, as that term is used in KRS 45A.095,
and the supplies or services are available locally, the city may enter into
noncompetitive negotiations with a local business. A non-local business may be
awarded a contract through noncompetitive negotiation only if no agreement can

required are not available locally.
         (b)   If supplies or services are purchased in an amount less than the
amount specified in KRS 424.260, the supplies or services may be purchased from
a local from a local business unless unavailable or the cost of the supplies or

         (c)   If supplies or services are to be purchased by competitive
sealed bidding, as that term is used in KRS 45A.365, and the supplies or
services are available locally, the bid price or cost quoted by each local
business shall be reduced by 5% for the purpose of determining the lowest bid

defined in KR 45A.345.
         (d)   If supplies or services are to be purchased by competitive
negotiation, as that term is used in KRS 45A.370, and the supplies or services

shall be reduced by 5% for the purpose of evaluating which offer is most
advantageous to the city.
      (2)   If a contract is for services and a bidder or offeror will use
subcontractors to perform all or part of the work required under the contract,
the bidder or offeror, in order to qualify for the 5% preference under this
section, shall not subcontract more than 20% of the work to non-local
businesses unless the services are not available locally.
      (3)   In the event no bids or offers are received from a non-local
business or any solicitation or where the supplies or services are not
available from a local business, then the preference established herein shall
not apply. Preferences shall not be allowed where the supplies or services
required are not available locally.

explicitly that preferences shall be afforded local businesses in accordance

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 35.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “City of Versailles Code
of Ethics.”
(Ord. 2007-13, passed 5-15-07; Am. Ord. 2012-9, passed 7-3-12)
§ 35.02 FINDINGS.
   The legislative body of the city finds and declares that:
   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of this city depends upon
the public’s confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers
and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the private
interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled.
   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
(Ord. 2007-13, passed 5-15-07; Am. Ord. 2012-9, passed 7-3-12)
§ 35.03 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring that
standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for officers
and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in their
application, and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
KRS Chapter 65 as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS Chapter 65.

if any contract entered into by a city or city agency officer or employee
before he or she became a candidate, was appointed to office, or was hired as

   (C)   The Mayor and members of the City Council may not occupy any other

office.
(Ord. 2017-21, passed 8-1-17)
§ 35.13 WITHDRAWAL FROM PARTICIPATION.
   (A)   An officer or employee must refrain from acting on or discussing,
formally or informally, a matter before the city , if acting on the matter, or
failing to act on the matter, may personally or financially benefit any of the
persons or entities listed in §
35.10(C). Such an officer or employee should join the public if the withdrawal
occurs at a public meeting, or leave the room if it is a legally conducted
closed meeting (executive session) under KRS 61.810 and KRS 61.815.
   (B)   Withdrawal at a meeting requires the public announcement, on the
record, of the reason for withdrawal.
   (C)   Ongoing conflict: an officer or employee whose outside employment or
other outside activity or relationship can reasonably be expected to require
more than sporadic withdrawal must resign their position with the city or cease
such outside employment or activity. An officer or employee should not begin
employment or an activity or relationship that can reasonably be expected to
require more than sporadic withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is
in such a situation, he or she should not accept the position with the city.
   (D)   Request to withdraw: if an officer or appointed board member is
requested to withdraw from participation in a matter, for the reason that he or
she has a conflict of interest, by:
      (1)   Another member;
      (2)   A party to the current matter; or
      (3)   Anyone else who may be affected by a decision relating to this
matter;
      the member must decide whether to withdraw on the official record. If the
member decides not to withdraw, the unchallenged members must consider any
relevant evidence concerning such claimed conflict of interest, as defined in
this code, and vote whether or not to allow the request and require that the
member withdraw from participating in the matter.
   (E)   If withdrawal by the member would leave the body with less than a
quorum capable of acting, the member must disclose the conflict on the public
record, then the remaining members may vote to allow the member with the
disclosed conflict a vote. If the person is the only one authorized by law to
act, the person must disclose the nature and circumstances of the conflict to
the Board of Ethics and ask for a waiver or advisory opinion.

public duties.

believes his or her accusation to be true, and then learns that it was false,
even in part, he or she should apologize in the same forum the accusations were
made. A failure to so apologize within a reasonable period of time after

this code may exist, and prepare a complaint of its own. The Board of Ethics
may also amend a complaint that has been filed with it by adding further
allegations, by adding respondents involved in the same conduct, directly or
indirectly, by action or inaction, or by deleting allegations that would not
constitute a violation of this code, have been made against persons or entities

materially related. Amended complaints must be sent to the complainant by the

whether the complaint is within its jurisdiction and, if so, whether it alleges
a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation of this chapter. If the Board

without factual basis, the Board shall immediately terminate the inquiry,
reduce the conclusion to writing, and transmit a copy of its decision to the
complainant and to all officers or employees against whom the complaint was
filed.

that the complaint is within its jurisdiction and contains allegations
sufficient to establish a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation, the
Board shall notify the officer or employee who is the subject of the complaint
and may:
      (1)   Due to mitigating circumstances such as, lack of significant
economic advantage or gain by the officer or employee, lack of economic loss to
the city and its taxpayers, or lack of significant impact on public confidence

confidential reprimand to the executive authority and governing body of the

no violation.

extent that such denial is required or protected by federal, state, or local
law.

denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request,

(30)days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit court. In
addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or if the city
continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney General's
opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in circuit
court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.
(KRS 61.880, 61.882)

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under

      (2)   The period of adjustment shall extend over a maximum of two monthly
billing periods and no more than two (2) monthly bills will be adjusted.
      (3)   The sewer portion of the customer’s bill will be adjusted to
reflect usage of seventy-five hundred (7,500) gallons of water per month.

ninety (90) days after the bill for the month(s) to be adjusted has been
received.

supply water exclusively for the purpose of watering sod and other plants,
washing automobiles, and other exterior purpose in which none of the water

§ 51.01 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A) This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the city
and enables the city to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws
required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the general Pretreatment
Regulations (40 CFR, Part 403).
   (B) The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the
system;
      (3) To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system; and
      (4) To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system.
   (C) This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits
to certain non-domestic users, enforcement of general requirements for all
users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires industrial

sanitary sewage collection, treatment and disposal facilities are available, or
may hereafter be made available; of septic tanks, seepage laterals, privies,
earth pits, cesspools, sanitary waste vaults, sewage drainage fields, private
sewage disposal systems, or any other facilities or works for the disposition
of sanitary sewage wastes other than the facilities of the city, is hereby
declared to be a menace to the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the citizens and inhabitants of the city and is hereby determined and declared
to constitute a public nuisance. The existence of such facilities as toilets,
sinks, wash basins, showerbaths, bathtubs, any commercial or industrial
machinery or device producing a liquid waste product, etc., in or upon any
improved property or premises in the city where the facilities of the city's
sewage collection, treatment, and disposal system are available or may
hereafter be made available, is similarly declared to be a menace to the public
health and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants, unless the
facilities are connected to the city sewage collection, treatment and disposal
system. The superintendent may prescribe the type and manner of connection to
the facilities, and may require that each connection be supervised and
inspected by an authorized and qualified agent of the city sewer department.
   (C) When a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private
wastewater disposal system, a direct connection shall be made to the public
sewer system in compliance with this chapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools
and similar private wastewater disposal facilities shall be cleaned of sludge
and filled with suitable material or salvaged and removed.

building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway, the sewer
from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any
obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such
single connection aforementioned.
   (B)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Public Works Director, to
meet all requirements of this chapter. Permit and inspection fees for new
buildings using existing building sewers shall be the same as for new building
sewers. If additional sewer consumers are added to the old building sewers,
additional sewer tap fees shall be charged accordingly even though no new sewer
tap is actually made into the city system.
   (C)   Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customers
side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than that of the
customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be permitted.
   (D)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the local and state building and plumbing codes and other applicable rules and
regulations of the city. In the absence of local code provisions or in

disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory
to the city.
   (G)   In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.
Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary drainage shall be above
basement floor or in separately watertight or drained sump or channel.
   (H)   All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet or
exceed the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code.
   (I)   All persons performing maintenance on city sewers shall use methods
and equipment approved by the Public Works Director.
   (J)   All necessary cleaning of house connections, including root removal,
and the removal of stoppages, from the building to the point of connection to
the city’s main collector or trunk line shall be the responsibility of the

   (B) All building sewers shall be smoke tested through the wye branch at the
public sewer connection, with public sewer tightly plugged off, after
connections at both ends are made and after all pipe is properly bedded and
backfilled at least to top of pipe and if backfill is completed, within two
weeks after completion of backfill. At time of test any openings into the
building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any
leakage of smoke from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be
located at test and repaired to stand repetition of smoke test without leakage.
When smoke testing is completed, the temporary flow line plug shall be removed
and a permanent water-tight plug shall be placed in branch of test wye-branch
and carefully backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six inches above the
top of the branch.

      (7)   Requirements for maintaining and retaining all records relating to
wastewater discharge as specified by the city for a minimum of three (3) years,
and afford city access thereto;
      (8)   Requirements for notification of the city of any new introduction
of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character
of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the city's wastewater
treatment system;
      (9)   Requirements for notification of slug discharges;
      (10)   Requirements for the user to reimburse the city for the expenses
related to monitoring, sampling, and testing performed at the direction of the
Superintendent and deemed necessary by the city to verify that the user is in
compliance with the permit;
      (11)   Any other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Superintendent
and/or the city to ensure compliance with this chapter;
      (12)   Requirements for submission of technical reports or discharge
reports;
      (13)   A statement that indicates the industrial user discharge permit
issuance date, expiration date and effective date;
      (14)   A statement that the industrial user permit is nontransferable;
      (15)   Requirements to control slug discharge if determined by the
Superintendent to be necessary; and
      (16)   A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for
violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable
compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance
beyond that required by applicable federal, state or local law.
   (B)   Where an effluent from an industrial process is mixed prior to
treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process,
fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge permit by
the Superintendent. These alternative limits shall be applied to the mixed
effluent. These alternative limits shall be calculated using the combined
wastestream formula and/or flow-weighted average formula given in 40 CFR 403.6
(e). Where the effluent limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production
(production-based standard), the Superintendent may convert the limits to
equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day
or of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent permit
limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be subject to all
permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully
comply with these alternative limits. All categorical industrial users subject
to production-based standards must report production rates annually so that
alternative permit limits can be calculated if necessary. The categorical user
must notify the Superintendent thirty (30) days in advance of any change in
production levels that might effect the flow or other data used to calculate
the effluent limits in the discharge permit.
   (C)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert
the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
Superintendent. The Superintendent may establish equivalent mass limits only if
the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth as follows:
      (1)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must: (i) employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its industrial user discharge permit; (ii) currently use control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for
treatment; (iii) provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions; (iv) not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and (v) have consistently complied with
all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to
the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.
      (2)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: (i)
maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; (ii) continue to record the
facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring
device; (iii) continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
superintendent whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than
twenty percent (20%) from its long-term average production rates. Upon
notification of a revised production rate, the Superintendent will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and (iv) continue to employ the same or comparable
water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to
division (C)(1)(i) of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent
mass limit.
      (3)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Superintendent shall:
(i) calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily
flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the
concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor; (ii) upon notification of a revised production rate, will
reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and (iii) may retain the same
equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual user discharge permit terms if
the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a
result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies,
and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the
equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for
treatment.

§ 51.54 PERMIT DURATION.
   Industrial user discharge permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five (5) years. A permit may be issued for a period less
than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply
for permit reissuance a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the
permit may be subject to modification by the city during the term of the permit
as limitations or requirements as identified in §§ 51.40 through 51.48 are
modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed
changes in their permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date
of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a
reasonable time frame for compliance.
(Ord., passed 8-20-91)
§ 51.55 PERMIT TRANSFER.
   Industrial user discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a
specific operation. An industrial user discharge permit shall not be reassigned
or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new
or changed operation without, at a minimum, a thirty (30) day prior
notification of the change to the superintendent and provision of a copy of the
existing permit to the new owner. The superintendent may deny the transfer of
the permit if it is deemed necessary to comply with all provisions of this
chapter.
(Ord., passed 8-20-91)
§ 51.56 REPORTING REQUIREMENT FOR PERMITTEE.
   (A)   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new user, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into POTW, any user subject to
federal categorical pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Superintendent a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process or processes which are
limited by categorical pretreatment standards and requirements and the average
and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are
limited by such categorical standards and requirements. The report shall state
whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards and requirements are
being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional pretreatment
equipment and time schedule are necessary to bring the user into compliance
with the applicable categorical standard or requirement. This statement shall
be signed by an authorized representative of the user. Where compliance
schedules are required, the following conditions shall apply:
      (1)   All significant industrial users shall submit to the superintendent
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by a
pretreatment standard, or the industrial user discharge permit, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by such pretreatment standards or the industrial user discharge permit.
The report shall also include the chain-of-custody (COC) forms, field data and
any other information required by the Superintendent. In addition, this report
shall include a record of all daily flows or the average daily flow. At the
discretion of the superintendent and in consideration of factors as local high
or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Superintendent may agree
to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. All
periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with 40
CFR 403.12 and this section.
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months; and
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule.
   (B)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   All significant industrial users shall submit to the superintendent
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by a
pretreatment standard, or the industrial user discharge permit, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by such pretreatment standards or the industrial user discharge permit.
The report shall also include the chain-of-custody (COC) forms, field data and
any other information required by the Superintendent. In addition, this report
shall include a record of all daily flows or the average daily flow. At the
discretion of the superintendent and in consideration of factors as local high
or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Superintendent may agree
to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. All
periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with 40
CFR 403.12 and § 52.61 of this chapter.
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge. All analyses shall be performed by a
laboratory acceptable to the city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance
with procedures established by the U.S. EPA pursuant to Section 304(g) of the
Act and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test
procedures approved by the U.S. EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance
with the techniques approved by the U.S. EPA. Except as indicated in divisions
(B)(2)(a) and (B)(2)(b) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using
24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Superintendent, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
CFR 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a
24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide,
total phenols and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or
in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected
by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may
be authorized by the Superintendent, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples
may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
         (a)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
         (b)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-
day compliance reports required in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four
(4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data
are available, the Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial user is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
      (3)   Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication
"Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants," April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA.
      (4)   All industrial users shall retain all pretreatment records for a
minimum of three (3) years, as required by 40 CFR 403.12(o)(2).
   (C)   (1)   A baseline monitoring report (BMR) must be submitted to the
Superintendent by all categorical industrial users at least ninety (90) days
prior to initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. The BMR must contain,
at a minimum, the following:
         (a)   Production data including a process description, SIC code
number, raw materials used, chemicals used, and final product(s) produced;
pretreatment industrial category (if applicable), and a schematic which
indicates points of discharge to the sewer system.
         (b)   Identifying information to include name, address of facility,
owner(s), contact person and any other environmental permits held by the
facility.
         (c)   Wastewater characteristics such as total plant flow, types of
discharges, average and maximum flows from each process.
         (d)   Nature and concentration of pollutants discharged to the public
sewer system that are regulated by this chapter, state and/or federal
pretreatment standards and sample type and location (all analyses must conform
with 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto).
         (e)   Information concerning any pretreatment equipment used to treat
the facility's discharge.
         (f)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if
not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (g)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule shall not
be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in §
51.53(F) of this chapter.
      (2)   All new sources of industrial discharge must be in compliance with
all provisions of this chapter prior to commencement of discharge.
      (3)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions
shall apply to all compliance schedules required by this chapter:
         (a)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards.
         (b)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
         (c)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and in no event
shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the
Superintendent.
      (4)   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and
documentation associated with best management practices as may be required.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for
a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall automatically be
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city or
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention by the
Superintendent.
(Ord., passed 8-20-91; Am. Ord. 2011-35, passed 1-3-12)
§ 51.57 PERMIT VIOLATIONS.
   All significant industrial users must notify the superintendent within
twenty-four (24) hours of first becoming aware of a permit violation. This
notification shall include the date of the violation, the parameter violated
and the amount in exceedance. Within thirty (30) days of first becoming aware
of a permit violation, the significant industrial user must resample analysis
to the superintendent, unless the superintendent, on behalf of the city,
conducts monitoring of this parameter within that thirty (30) day period.
§ 51.58 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A) The city shall require significant industrial users to provide and
operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
system. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's
premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in a public
right-of-way. The superintendent shall review and approve the location, plans,
and specifications for such monitoring facilities and may require them to be
constructed to provide for the separate monitoring and sampling of industrial
waste and sanitary sewage flows. There shall be ample room in or near such
sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense
of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days
following approval of the location plans and specifications.
   (B) All sampling analyses done in accordance with approved U.S. EPA
procedures by the significant industrial user during a reporting period shall
be submitted to the superintendent, regardless of whether or not that analysis
was required by the user's discharge permit.
   (C) The significant industrial user must receive the approval of the
superintendent before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring facilities
to be used in all required sampling.
(Ord., passed 8-20-91)
§ 51.59 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The superintendent shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection,
sampling, copying records examination, or in the performance of any of their
duties. "Reasonable times" shall include any time during which the user is
discharging to the public sewer system and/or operating any manufacturing
process. The city approval authority and U.S. EPA shall have the right to set
up on the user's property devices necessary to conduct sampling, inspections,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements
for their security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city approval authority and U.S. EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific
duties.
(Ord., passed 8-20-91)
§ 51.60 PRETREATMENT.
   (A) All significant industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance
with all applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time
limits as specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. The city may
require the development of a compliance schedule for installation of
pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any significant industrial user
that is not meeting discharge limits established in the user's industrial user
discharge permit. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent for review, and
shall be acceptable to the superintendent before construction of the facility.
The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the
user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce
an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall
be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of
the change.
   (B)   The city is required by federal regulations to keep the public
informed of all cases of significant violations. To accomplish this, the city
shall annually publish in a newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of
the users which were in significant noncompliance with any pretreatment
requirements or standards. "SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE" is any significant
violation that meets one or more of the following conditions:
      (1) Results in the exercise of emergency authority by the superintendent;
      (2) Remains uncorrected forty-five (45) days after notice of
noncompliance is given;
      (3) Involves failure to report noncompliance accurately;
      (4) Wastewater violations:
         (a) Chronic violations - Sixty-six (66) percent or more of all
measurements taken during a six (6) month period exceed, by any magnitude, the
daily maximum limit or the monthly average limit for same pollutant parameter;
         (b) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations - Thirty-three percent
(33%) or more of all measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a
six (6) month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or
the monthly average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats oils and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
         (c) Any violation of a pretreatment effluent limit that the
superintendent believes has caused alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass through or has endangered the health of the
POTW personnel or the public.
         (d) Any discharge causing imminent endangerment to human health or to
the environment or resulting in the superintendent's use of his emergency
authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
         (e) Violations of compliance schedule milestones, failure to comply
with schedule milestones for starting or completing construction or attaining
final compliance by ninety (90) days or more after the scheduled date.
         (f) Failure to provide required reports within thirty (30) days of the
due date.
         (g)   Any violation or group of violations which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the Superintendent determines
will adversely effect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program. The public notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions
taken against the user(s) during the same twelve (12) months. All records
relating to the pretreatment program of the city shall be made available to
officials of the U.S. EPA or approval authority and the general public upon
request. All records shall be maintained for a minimum of three (3) years in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.12 (o)(2).
   (C)   All applications, reports or information submitted to the city shall
be signed and certified in accordance with the following requirements. Written
designation of the signatory official must be received by the city prior to
acceptance of any application or other required document.
      (1)   All permit applications shall be signed:

ENFORCEMENT
§ 51.90 INFORMAL NOTICE TO INDUSTRIAL USERS.
   (A)   (1)   The city, through the Superintendent or his or her designee, to
insure compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40 CFR Subchapter
N, 401 through 471, and 401 KAR 5:055, Section 9, may take the following
enforcement steps against users in non-compliance with this chapter. The
remedies available to the Superintendent include injunctive relief, civil and
criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of discharges and/or water service
and the publishing of the list of significant violators annually. The
enforcement authority shall be vested in the Superintendent of the POTW or his
or her designee. The Superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or industrial user discharge permit when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the Superintendent, in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes
interference to the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its
NPDES/KPDES permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the industrial user discharge permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the wastewater discharge. In the event of a failure of the user to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as
deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection and/or
water service to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment
to any individuals. The city may reinstate the industrial user discharge permit
and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
non-complying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within fifteen
(15) days of the date of occurrence.
   (B)   All violations of requirements of this chapter must be reviewed and
responded to by the Superintendent or his or her representative. In general,
the Superintendent shall notify the industrial user when a violation occurs.
For all violations, the Superintendent shall receive an explanation and, as
appropriate, a plan from the industrial user to correct the violation within a
specific time period. If the violation(s) persist or the explanation and/or
plan are not adequate, the Superintendent's response shall be more formal and
commitments or schedules, as appropriate, for compliance will be established in
an enforceable document. The enforcement response selected will be related to
the seriousness of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if
compliance is not achieved expeditiously after the initial action. A
significant violation will require a formal enforcement action. The full scale
of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the city's pretreatment program
enforcement response plan. The enforcement actions and remedies provided for in
this chapter are not exclusive. The Superintendent may take any, all, or
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. However, the
Superintendent may take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further the Superintendent is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord., passed 8-20-91; Am. Ord. 2011-35, passed 1-3-12)
§ 51.91 ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
   (A) Informal notice - These actions include statements made to the
industrial user during sampling and/or inspection visits, telephone calls to
the appropriate company official, informal meetings, warning or reminder
letters. These informal notices shall be used for minor violations.
   (B) Formal actions - These actions include the following:
      (1) Notice of violation - Any person found to be violating any provision
of this chapter, wastewater discharge permit or any order issued hereunder
shall be served by the POTW superintendent with a written notice stating the
nature of the violation. The offender must permanently cease all violations.
      (2)   Administrative orders/fines.
         (a)   Any person who, after receiving a notice of violation, shall
continue to discharge in violation of this chapter to other pretreatment
standard or requirement or is determined to be a chronic or persistent violator
shall be ordered to appear before the superintendent. At the appearance, a
compliance schedule will be given to the violating user and an administrative
fine assessed. The fine shall be determined on a case-by-case basis which shall
consider the type, severity, duration and number of violations, severity of
impact on the POTW, impact on human health, user's economic benefit from
violation, past history of the user, and good-faith efforts made by the user.
The fine shall be non-arbitrary but appropriate amount.
         (b)   Users desiring to dispute such fines shall file with the
superintendent a request for the city to reconsider the fine within ten (10)
days of being notified of the fine. The city shall convene a hearing on the
matter within fifteen (15) days of receiving such a request from the user.
         (c)   The administrative order may take any of the following four
forms:
            (i)   Consent Order - The superintendent is hereby empowered to
enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for
the noncompliance. The orders will include specific action to be taken by the
industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified in the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as
all other administrative orders.
            (ii)   Compliance Order - When the superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or permit or
order issued hereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user
responsible for the violation directing that following a specified time period,
sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly
operated. Orders may also contain other requirements reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices.
            (iii)   Cease and Desist Order - When the superintendent finds that
an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder, the superintendent may issue an order to
cease and desist all violations to the user and direct those persons in
noncompliance to:
               (a)   Comply forthwith;
               (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and terminating the discharge.
            (iv)   Show Cause Hearing - The superintendent may issue to the
user who causes or contributes to violations of this chapter, discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, an order to appear and show cause why more severe
enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place of the hearing to be held by the superintendent
regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the
proposed enforcement action and directing the user to show cause before the
superintendent why more severe enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent or officer of the facility. Whether or not a
duly notified industrial user or its representative appears, immediate
enforcement action may be pursued. The city itself may conduct the hearing and
take evidence or may designate a representative to:
               (a)   Issue in the name of the city notices of hearings
requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings;
               (b)   Take the evidence; or
               (c)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city for
action thereon. At the hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony taken
must be under oath and recorded steno-graphically. The transcript, so recorded,
will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing
upon payment of the usual charges thereof. After the city has reviewed the
evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the violation
directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Further orders and
directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
§ 51.99 PENALTIES.
   (A) Written Notice. Any user found to be violating any provision of this

§ 52.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the impact fee program is to equitably recover capacity-
related capital costs from current and future customers to achieve equity
between the different generations of ratepayers (intergenerational equity).
Additionally, charging an impact fee is meant to equitably reimburse the
existing ratepayers for their investment in oversizing of infrastructure to
accommodate future customers.
(Ord. 2017-30, passed 11-21-17; Am. Ord. 2023-15, passed 8-1-23)
§ 52.02 DEFINITIONS.

effect of increasing the demands upon the water utility facilities.
“DEVELOPMENT” includes redevelopment of property. “DEVELOPMENT” includes
improved open areas such as plaza and walkways, but does not include natural
geologic forms or unimproved lands.
   “EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT (ERU).” The basis of assigning an impact fee

at the time of increased usage of the water utility, at the time of issuance of
a development permit or building permit, or at the time of connection to the
water system.
      (1)   An impact fee charge is not payment or reimbursement for the
utility's average cost of inspecting and installing connections with water
facilities-that reimbursement is called a “tap fee” and constitutes a separate
charge.
      (2)   An impact fee charge does not include fees assessed or collected as
part of a local improvement district or a charge in lieu of a local improvement
district assessment, or the cost of complying with requirements or conditions
imposed by a land use decision.
   “LAND AREA.” The area of a parcel of land as measured by projection of the
parcel boundaries upon a horizontal plane with the exception of a portion of
the parcel within a recorded right-of-way or easement subject to a servitude
for a public street or for a public scenic or preservation purpose.

subject of the development approval; or
         (b)   Located in whole or in part on or contiguous to a parcel of land
that is the subject of the development approval; or
         (c)   For purposes of this definition, contiguous means in a public
way which abuts the parcel.
   “REDEVELOPMENT.” Repurposing an existing structure.
   “SYSTEMWIDE IMPROVEMENTS FEE (BUY-IN).” A fee for costs associated with
capital improvements constructed or under construction on the date the fee is

2023-15, passed 8-1-23)
§ 52.03 FACTORS FOR IMPACT FEE CHARGE.
   Whereas the impact fee program assigns a fee to every new customer of the
Versailles water utility, it also pertains to existing customers whose water
usage has changed to present an increased demand on the water utility. Factors
that quantify a new or increased demand on the water system include:
   (A)   Meter size. Impacts by new development, or redevelopment, upon the
water system is estimated by the meter size of the proposed or expanded
facility. Since the vast majority of single-family residences are served
through a 3/4 by 5/8-inch water meter, the 3-4 by 5/8-inch water meter
represents one equivalent residential unit (ERU). Other meter sizes are listed
on the Impact Fee Charge Schedule and are assigned an ERU factor to estimate
their impact on the water system.
   (B)   Demand. The ERU represents the typical water demand of a single-family
residential unit. As described in division (A), any demand greater than the
ERU, as quantified by the potential of a larger meter, is estimated by applying
the relevant ERU factor.
(Ord. 2017-30, passed 11-21-17; Am. Ord. 2023-15, passed 8-1-23)
§ 52.04 Impact Fee Charge Established.
   (A)   Impact fee charges shall be established and may be revised by
resolution of the City Council. The resolution shall set the amount of the
charge, the type of permit to which the charge applies, and, if the charge
applies to a geographic area smaller than the entire city, the geographic area
subject to the charge.
   (B)   Unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of this chapter or the
other local or state law, an impact fee charge is hereby imposed upon all
development within the city limits, upon the act of making a connection to the
city water system within the city, and upon all development outside the
boundary of the city that connects to or otherwise uses the water facilities of
the city.
(Ord. 2017-30, passed 11-21-17; Am. Ord. 2023-15, passed 8-1-23)
§ 52.05 METHODOLOGY.
   (A)   The methodology used to establish or modify the systemwide
improvements or buy-in fee shall, where applicable, be based on the value of
existing assets at a depreciated replacement cost, accomplished through the use
of a construction cost index (as determined by the Engineering News Record) to
bring the historical or original costs up to a current-day value. Using this
method (replacement cost new less depreciation (RCNLD in AWWA M-1)), reasonably
reflects the cost of providing new expansion capacity to customers as if the
capacity was added at the time the new customers connected to the water system.
The method fairly compensates existing customers for the carrying costs of the
excess capacity built into the system in advance of when the new customers
connect to the system.
   (B)   Unlike the City of Versailles sewer impact fee, there is currently no
growth-related expansion fee as sufficient water treatment capacity exists for
future customers identified for the five and ten-year planning horizon.
   (C)   The ERU, the ERU factors, and the impact fee for each factor shall be
contained in a resolution adopted by the Council.
   (D)   The water impact fee is calculated by multiplying the ERU (in gallons
per day) by the ERU factor, then by the impact fee (in dollars per gallon). The
ERU and the impact fee are calculated specific to the Versailles water utility.
Both should be recalculated every five years, at a minimum.
(Ord. 2017-30, passed 11-21-17; Am. Ord. 2023-15, passed 8-1-23)
§ 52.06 Authorized Expenditures.
   (A)   Systemwide improvements (buy-in) fees shall be applied only to capital
improvements associated with the system for which the fees are assessed,
including expenditures relating to repayment of indebtedness.
   (B)   Growth-related expansion fees shall be assigned only for anticipated
expansion of the water utility.
   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) of this section, impact fee
revenues may be expended on the direct costs of complying with the provisions
of this chapter, including the costs of developing impact fee charge
methodologies and providing an annual accounting of impact fee expenditures.
   (D)   There is created a dedicated account entitled the “Water Impact Fee
Account.” All monies derived from the water impact fee shall be placed in the
Water Impact Fee Account. Funds in the Water Impact Fee Account shall be used
solely to provide the water capital improvements that relate to treatment and
storage and transmission that is of benefit to all customers, and eligible
administrative costs. In this regard, water impact fee revenues may be used for
purposes that include:
      (1)   Design and construction plan preparation;
      (2)   Permitting;
      (3)   Right-of-way acquisition, including any costs of acquisition and
condemnation;
      (4)   Construction of new water treatment facilities;
      (5)   Rehabilitation or replacement of filter media in existing
filtration system;
      (6)   Construction of raw water transmission lines and finished water
transmission lines that are of benefit to all customers of the water utility;
      (7)   Construction of pumping stations;
      (8)   Demolition that is part of the construction of any of the
improvements on this list;
      (9)   Repair and replacement of the capital items listed in divisions (D)
(4), (D)(5), and (D)(6) above;
      (10)   Payment of principal and interest, necessary reserves and costs of
issuance under any bonds or other indebtedness issued by the city to provide
money to construct or acquire water facilities; and
      (11)   Direct costs of complying with the provisions of any statute that
allows or limits impact fees, including the costs of developing impact fee
methodologies and providing an annual accounting of impact fee expenditures.

§ 52.07 EXPENDITURE RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   Impact fee charges shall not be expended for costs associated with the
construction of administrative office facilities that are more than an
incidental part of other capital improvements.
   (B)   Impact fee charges shall not be expended for costs of the operation or
routine maintenance of capital improvements.
(Ord. 2017-30, passed 11-21-17; Am. Ord. 2023-15, passed 8-1-23)
§ 52.08 IMPROVEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   Prior to the establishment of a water impact fee, the Council shall
adopt a plan that includes a list of:
      (1)   The capital improvements that the Council intends to fund in whole
or in part with impact fee revenues;
      (2)   The estimated cost and time of construction of each improvement and
the percentage of that cost eligible to be funded; and
      (3)   A description of the process for modifying the plan.
   (B)   In adopting this plan, the Council may incorporate by reference all or
a portion of any public facilities plan, master plan, capital improvements plan
or similar plan that contains the information required by this section.
   (C)   The Council may modify such plan and list at any time. If the impact
fee charge will be increased by a proposed modification to the list, to include
a capacity-increasing public improvement, the Council will:
      (1)   At least 30 days prior to adoption of the proposed modification,
provide written notice to persons who have requested notice pursuant to §
52.13 ;
      (2)   Hold a public hearing if a written request for a hearing is
received within seven days of the date of the proposed modification.
   (D)   A change in the amount of a systemwide improvements fee or a growth-
related expansion fee is not a modification of the impact fee charge if the
change in amount is based on the periodic application of the Engineering News-
Record's (ENR) Construction Cost Index or a modification to any of the factors
related to the rate that are incorporated in the established methodology. The
Council may elect to revise the impact fee annually based of the ENR
Construction Cost.

fee charge is payable at the time the usage of the capital improvement is
increased based on changes in the use of the property unrelated to seasonal or
orderly fluctuations in usage.
   (C)   If development is commenced or connection is made to the water system
without an appropriate permit, the impact fee charge is immediately payable
upon the earliest date that a permit was required.
   (D)   If requested by the applicant, the City Clerk may provide the
applicant an estimate of the impact fee charge when a permit that allows
building or development of a parcel is issued.
   (E)   The impact fee program administrator shall not issue such permit or
allow such connection until the charge has been paid in full, or until
provision for installment payments has been made pursuant to §

(Ord. 2017-30, passed 11-21-17; Am. Ord. 2023-15, passed 8-1-23)
§ 52.10 INSTALLMENT PAYMENT.
   (A)   When an impact fee charge based on a meter size of four inches or more
is due and collectible, the owner of the parcel of land subject to the impact
fee may apply for payment in six semi-annual installments, to include interest
(at two points above the prime rate at the time of request) on the unpaid
balance.
   (B)   The impact fee program administrator shall provide application forms
for installment payments, which shall include a waiver of all rights to contest
validity of the lien, except for the correction of computational errors.
   (C)   An applicant for installment payments shall have the burden of
demonstrating the applicant's authority to assent to the imposition of a lien
on the parcel and that the property interest of the applicant is adequate to

(Ord. 2017-30, passed 11-21-17; Am. Ord. 2023-15, passed 8-1-23)
§ 52.12 CREDITS.
   (A)   When a redevelopment occurs that is subject to an impact fee charge,
the impact fee charge for the existing use, if applicable, shall be calculated
and if it is less than the impact fee charge for the use that will result from
the development, the difference between the impact fee for the existing use and
the impact fee for the proposed use shall be the impact fee charge. If the
change in the use results in the impact fee for the proposed use being less
than the impact fee for the existing use, no impact fee charge shall be
required. Since meter size is used to calculate impact fees, the impact on the
water system is assessed by considering the meter size of the existing
development versus the meter size of the redevelopment. No refund or credit
shall be given unless provided for by another division of this section.
   (B)   If a qualified public improvement is located in whole or in part on or
contiguous to the property that is the subject of the development approval and
is required by the utilities manager for the City of Versailles to be built
larger or with greater capacity than is necessary for the particular
development project, a credit shall be given for the cost of the portion of the
improvement that exceeds the city's minimum standard facility size or capacity
needed to serve the particular development project or property. The applicant
shall have the burden of demonstrating that a particular improvement qualifies
for credit under this division. The request for credit shall be filed in
writing no later than 60 days after acceptance of the improvement by the city.
The city may deny the credit provided for in this section if the city
demonstrates that the application does not meet the requirements of this
section or if the improvement for which the credit is sought was not included
in the improvement plan pursuant to §
52.08 .
   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) above, when establishing a
methodology for a water impact fee charge, the city may provide for a credit
against the systemwide improvements (buy-in) fee for capital improvements
constructed as part of the development which reduce the development's demand
upon existing capital improvements and/or the need for future capital
improvements, or a credit based upon any other rationale the Council finds
reasonable.
   (D)   Credits shall not be transferable from one development to another.
   (E)   Credits shall not be transferable between utilities (water credit to
sewer, or sewer credit to water) to another.
   (F)   Credits shall be used within ten years from the date the credit is
given.

Council. Written notice shall be mailed to persons on the list at least 30 days
prior to the hearing to establish or modify an impact fee charge. The

portion of the impact fee charge calculated and collected on account of the
water system shall be used for no purpose other than set forth in §
52.06 .
   (B)   The City Clerk shall provide the City Council with an annual
accounting for impact fee charges showing the total and the projects funded

   Where the stormwater facilities are located upon property owned by one or
more individuals, the mowing requirements for maintenance of such areas shall
be enforced through the city's nuisance code contained in §

(Ord. 2023-4, passed 4-18-23)
§ 53.03 PROPERTY DESIGNATED AS HOA OR COMMON AREA.
   Where the stormwater detention, retention or management area is located upon
property designated as HOA or common area on a subdivision plat, the
maintenance and management of such areas shall be enforced as follows:
   (A)   Once the City Public Works Director has determined that the
maintenance and management of the stormwater detention, retention or management
area is insufficient and the Public Works Director has been unsuccessful at
locating a homeowners association or other persons or entities who will
adequately manage and maintain the stormwater area, the Public Works Director
shall review the plats and any stormwater management studies of the subdivision
where the lots are located and determine which lots are benefitting from the
stormwater retention area and the lots that would not have otherwise been
created under the local zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations without
the stormwater retention area at issue.
   (B)   Upon making such determination, the city shall advise the affected
property owners in writing that the city will be undertaking the maintenance
and management of the stormwater facilities and that the cost of such
maintenance along with an administrative fee will be assessed pro rata to the

§ 53.04 FAILURE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The City of Versailles is hereby authorized to undertake maintenance

the owners of the lots within the subdivision fail to provide adequate
maintenance of the common areas. The work to be performed by the city in such
instances shall be limited to preventing the common area from becoming a
nuisance under the city's ordinances.

maintenance of a common area within a subdivision is creating a public nuisance
and the Public Works Director has been unsuccessful at locating a homeowners
association or other persons or entities who will adequately maintain the
common area, the city shall advise the owners of properties on the plat
creating the common area in writing that the city will be undertaking the
maintenance of the common area and that the cost of such maintenance along with
an administrative fee will be assessed pro rata to the property owners on their
annual ad valorem tax bills. This notice shall include a provision advising the

facilities and maintaining common areas, plus a reasonable cost for the billing
and collection of this cost, will be allocated equally among the property
owners benefitted by the work and included as an additional assessment annually
on the city tax bills for each benefitted property as determined by the Public
Works Director. An appeal to the Mayor will stay the city's maintenance of the
facilities except for such work that the Public Works Director determines is
necessary to avoid immediate harm to the citizens or the city's stormwater
facilities or to abate a nuisance.

within the ten (10) days by the towing and storage company, then only ten (10)
days of storage may be charged.
         (d)   The lienholder has the right to take possession of the motor
vehicle after showing proof of lien still enforced, and paying the reasonable
or agreed towing and storage charges on the motor vehicle.
         (e)   If a lienholder does not exercise the right to take possession
of the motor vehicle under this division within forty-five (45) days of
notification the towing company or storage facility may obtain a new title
under KRS 186A.145 free and clear of any liens, excluding tax liens.
         (f)   Nothing in this section shall allow the transfer of a vehicle
subject to a lien, except as provided in KRS 186A.190 or in division (A)(3)(e).

parked there, may settle and compromise the claim against him for such illegal
parking by paying to the city such sums as are established by the City Council
and printed on the traffic ticket within such time limits as are established by
the Council and printed on the ticket upon demand. If a person fails to pay the
prescribed sum within fifteen (15) days of issue, the sum shall be doubled in
value. If the sum remains unpaid for thirty (30) days thereafter the Police
Department shall institute a prosecution with the County Attorney.
   (B) If any vehicle is witnessed to be in violation of § 71.31 and the
identity of the operator is not otherwise apparent, it shall be a rebuttable
presumption that the person in whose name the vehicle is registered or leased

subject to the penalties as provided herein. The members of the Police
Department are authorized to refrain from instituting a prosecution for the
alleged offense involved when the provisions of division (A) are complied with
by the individual charged.

obstruct the entrance or exit of any place where Police or Fire Department
apparatus or other emergency equipment is kept or housed, or so as to block an
emergency entrance to a hospital. This section shall not apply to any person
charged with parking a vehicle so as to entirely obstruct traffic in any street

110.99
§ 110.04 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, net profit shall
be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) of this section.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will
fairly represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this subchapter. The
occupational license tax imposed in this subchapter is assessed against income
before it is "passed through" these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this ordinance on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld

required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational

severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
subsection unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for,
or pay over the tax imposed by this subchapter at the time that the taxes
imposed by this subchapter become or became due.
   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H) of this section, every employee
receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
110.03 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the tax levied under this subchapter from the
employee, such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the
city each quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer.

   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax

entity in order to audit the return, the city may compel the business entity to
produce for inspection a copy of any statements and schedules in support
thereof that have not been previously filed. The city may also require copies
of reports of adjustments made by the federal government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to a occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this subchapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns, and comply with rules as the city from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems sufficient to
determine the tax liability the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the taxable income
of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business
entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity, as
appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the city at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return, determined without

order to determine the extent to which applications may further or impede the
objectives of those guidelines.

the Administrator may, in his or her discretion, deem desirable, reasonable, or
appropriate to the consideration of the application.
(Ord. 2018-18, passed 6-19-18)
§ 120.17 OTHER CONDITIONS.
   In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations required or
permitted by law:
   (A)   The City ABC Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage
license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his or her
place of business shall have been approved by the City Building Inspector, and
any and all other inspections required by the Kentucky Building Code;
   (B)   All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal background check
and shall sign a waiver allowing the release of this information to the City
ABC Administrator; and
   (C)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be granted or
renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any taxes or fees due
the city at the time of issuing the license, nor shall any license be granted
or renewed to sell upon any premises or property, owned and occupied by the
licensee upon which there are any delinquent taxes or fees due the city.
Further, if a licensee becomes delinquent in the payment of any taxes or any
fees due the city at any time during the license period, the license to sell
alcoholic or malt beverages shall be subject to revocation or suspension.
   (D)   No person, whether an applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in
any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the City
ABC Administrator, or any member of his or her staff, or any State ABC
Administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This provision is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a City or State ABC
Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a
license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for
appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this
section. This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit monetary settlements
in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order or
revocation or suspension, where the chapter and applicable statutes allow for
such payments in settlement.
(Ord. 2018-18, passed 6-19-18)
§ 120.18 FORM OF LICENSE.
   All city licenses shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the City
Council and shall contain:
   (A)   The name and address of the licensee;
   (B)   The number of the license;
   (C)   The type of license;

§ 120.19 CHANGE OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the City ABC Administrator within ten (10) days of the change.
   (B)   Any changes in the established premises boundaries as approved by the
State ABC Board or City ABC Administrator must be filed within ten (10) days of
the change.
   (C)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The
City ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
      (1)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other
business organization herein, the word "change" is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the
corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than ten
percent (10%) of the total ownership or stock shall require a new license.
      (2)   The following information will be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
         (a)   Name and address;
         (b)   Nature of interest;
         (c)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         (d)   Date of birth;
         (e)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of

         (f)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license
or in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding
a license under this chapter;
         (g)   Extent of stock or company ownership; and
         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in
any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license in any other state or province.
      (3)   This information shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator as
a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten (10) days of any change of required
information.

120.99
§ 120.20 RENEWAL OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Every year, except in the case of temporary licenses, each licensee
shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the City ABC
Administrator no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the
license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except
where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises
licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act
of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the
premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private
organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
exiting lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less than twenty (20) days from the expiration date of the
license, setting forth these facts, and the City ABC Administrator is hereby
authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a
reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the City ABC
Administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from
the expiration date of the former license or licenses. Said license fee shall
not be payable until application is made for the transfer of said license to a
new location.
   (B)   The renewal by the City ABC Administrator of the license shall not be
construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to
such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the licensee.
(Ord. 2018-18, passed 6-19-18) Penalty, see §
120.99
§ 120.21 LOST OR DESTROYED LICENSE.
   When a license shall be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of the
licensee or his or her agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the original
license shall be issued by the City ABC Administrator after the Administrator
shall have been satisfied as to the facts; provided, however, that the
applicant for said duplicate license shall pay a fee of ten dollars ($10) for
the duplicate license.
(Ord. 2018-18, passed 6-19-18)
§ 120.22 REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.

through 244, or any rule or regulation of the ABC Board or of the Department of
Revenue relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale and transportation
or taxation of alcoholic beverages or if such licensee shall have violated or

effect relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale and transportation
or taxation of intoxicating liquors or any rules or regulations of the city
heretofore in existence or authorized by the terms of KRS Ch. 241 through 244
to be created, irrespective of whether the licensee knew of or permitted the
violation or whether the violation was committed in disobedience of his or her
instructions, or any such license may be revoked or suspended for any cause
which the City ABC Administrator in the exercise of his or her sound discretion
deems sufficient.
   (B)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the City ABC
Administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had
been known.
   (C)   In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be revoked
or suspended for the following causes:
      (1)   Conviction of the licensee or his or her agent or employee for
selling any illegal beverages on the premises licensed.
      (2)   Making any false, material statements in an application for a
license.
      (3)   If within a period of two (2) consecutive years, any licensee or
any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the licensee shall have been convicted
of two (2) violations of the terms and provisions of KRS Chapter 241 through
244 or any act heretofore or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of

one (1) such felony and one (1) such misdemeanor.
      (4)   Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee to pay an
excise tax or any part thereof, or any penalties imposed by or under the
provisions of any statutes, this chapter or acts of Congress relative to
taxation, or for a violation of any rules or regulations of the Department of
Revenue made in pursuance thereof.
      (5)   Gambling. See §
120.30.

         (b)   Knowingly permitting the trafficking or possession by patrons
upon the licensed premises of controlled or illegal substances described in KRS
218A.
         (c)   Knowingly receiving stolen property upon the licensed premises.

§ 120.23 PROCEEDINGS FOR REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE.
   According to KRS 243.520, the City of Versailles Police Department, City ABC
Administrator and investigator(s) may, on its own initiative or on the
complaint of any person, institute administrative proceedings before the Board
to revoke or suspend any license. A license may be revoked or suspended only
after the licensee has been afforded the opportunity for a hearing conducted in
accordance with KRS Chapter 13B. The Department may issue an emergency order
pursuant to KRS 13B.125 to summarily suspend a license upon finding that
continued operation of the license holder pending a hearing would constitute a
threat to the public health, safety, or welfare.
   (A)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any
law enforcement officer or of the City ABC Administrator, the City ABC
Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license
granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after
the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered
mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such
proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in
opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or
in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
   (B)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall be prescribed by the City Council of the City of
Versailles by municipal order. Such order shall be maintained on file in the
office of the City ABC Administrator and a copy furnished with any notice of
proposed revocation or suspension sent to a licensee. If the Commission shall
fail to adopt such municipal order, the procedures shall be those set out in
the Kentucky Administrative Procedure Act (KRS Chapter 13B).
   (C)   A decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or suspending a
license may be appealed as provided in KRS 243.550.
   (D)   Within three (3) days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the City ABC Administrator.
   (E)   If the revoked or suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by
the licensee, the Chief of Police at the request of the City ABC Administrator
shall immediately cause one of his or her officers to take physical possession
of the license and return it to the City ABC Administrator.
   (F)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee may,
with prior approval of the City ABC Administrator, dispose of and transfer his
or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
   (G)   Appeal from the decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or
suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing of an appeal
shall stay further proceedings for revocation.
   (H)   If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the City ABC
Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at once
suspend all operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the entry of a
final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on
appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under this
license.
(Ord. 2018-18, passed 6-19-18)
§ 120.24 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION.
   The Police Chief or the Chief's designee or City ABC Administrator can order
an Emergency Suspension when they believe the health, welfare, safety and
security is jeopardized by the continued operation of a licensee. While the
license is suspended immediately, licensees are entitled to an expedited
hearing within three (3) days with the ABC Administrator. An emergency order
remains in effect until a decision is reached or appealed. A licensee may
remain open during a suspension provided they no longer serve or give away
alcohol.
(Ord. 2018-18, passed 6-19-18)
§ 120.25 TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT.
   No license issued under this chapter shall be transferred or assigned either
as to licensee or location except with prior approval of the City ABC
Administrator and not then until a payment of one hundred dollars ($100) shall
be made to the City ABC Administrator.
(Ord. 2018-18, passed 6-19-18)
§ 120.26 REFUSAL OF LICENSE; GUIDELINES FOR APPROVAL OF QUOTA LICENSES.
   (A)   The City ABC Administrator may refuse to issue or renew a license for
any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for suspension
or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for state
licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as violation of
any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or the
administration thereof.
      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of license
would be authorized; or
      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
   (B)   In the case of quota licenses, before approving an application, the
City ABC Administrator is hereby directed to consider, in addition to the
factors set out in KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, and any other factors the
Administrator determines in his or her discretion to be reasonable and
pertinent to the license application, the following criteria:
      (1)   Ownership. The City of Versailles places great value on business
owners who are invested in the Versailles community.
      (2)   Economic impact. The City of Versailles desires businesses which
make the most positive impact on the community, in number of jobs, payroll,
property investment and revenues to the city.
      (3)   Site of business. The City of Versailles is interested in serving
all geographic areas of the city. Therefore, the city does not wish to cluster
all licensed ABC outlets in one area.
      (4)   Aesthetics. The City of Versailles is committed to protecting the
character and beauty of our community.
      (5)   Revitalization of downtown. The City of Versailles wholeheartedly
supports the revitalization of downtown and the revitalization and reuse of
existing buildings.
      (6)   Capital. The City of Versailles values businesses that demonstrate
their ability to financially support and sustain their viability.
      (7)   Public support of licensed business in the area. The City of
Versailles intends that public sentiment and safety be considered in deciding
upon the approval of retail liquor sales licenses in any area of the city.
   (C)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the City ABC
Administrator may appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KRS 241.200.
(Ord. 2018-18, passed 6-19-18)
§ 120.27 REVIEW OF LICENSE; BOOKS, RECORDS, AUDIO AND VISUAL RECORDINGS, AND
REPORTS.
   (A)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter shall
provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of
any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant's business income is earned from the sale
of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated
with the applicant's quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide
the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identify each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of
food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for
filing of reports notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the
premises of any licensee and examine the books, audio and visual recordings,
and records to determine whether the licensee is in compliance with all parts
of this chapter. In the event the conditions of any license requirement are not
met during any particular quarter, the City ABC Administrator shall have
discretion in determining whether revocation is appropriate or whether the
licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a
good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee, the City ABC Administrator
may apply an accounting period of at least one (1) year in determining whether
or not the food sale percentage requirement has been met.
   (B)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain upon the
licensed premises adequate books and records of all transactions involved in
the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the City ABC Administrator and such city
employees who may assist the City ABC Administrator in his or her review.
(Ord. 2018-18, passed 6-19-18)
§ 120.28 DORMANCY.
   (A)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after ninety (90) days. Such is the intent of this
section. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her
business interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various
exceptions to the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
   (B)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of
ninety (90) days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth
in division (C) below are proved to the satisfaction of the City ABC
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the City
ABC Administrator.
   (C)   The provisions of division (B) hereof shall not apply to any licensee
who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a license is
issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of
the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency under
power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or
loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the
expiration of ninety (90) days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to
the City ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the fact that the
licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set
forth herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an extension of the
dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect during the license
period or until same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the
fact that no business is transacted during said period; provided, however, no
such license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted thereunder
within twelve (12) months from the date of notice to the City ABC
Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of
his or her sound discretion.

from the outdoor screening of patio provision to permit seasonal and temporary
sidewalk cafés that serve food and/or alcoholic beverages as an adjunct to the
primary and adjacent licensed premises. In the case of permitted temporary
sidewalk cafés, they shall be deemed part of the licensed premises. A sidewalk
café permit is deemed seasonal and temporary in that licensees with a sidewalk
café permit shall not place tables and seating on public sidewalks on a
continuous basis from November 1 through February 28; however, tables and
seating may be placed intermittently during this period if appropriate weather
occurs.
   (B)   Any establishment which is licensed under this chapter and the
provisions of the State ABC Code, may, upon application to the local ABC
Administrator, ask permission to expand on a seasonal and temporary basis, the
operation of that business onto a part, and only that part, of the public
sidewalk which immediately adjoins the licensed premises (hereinafter referred
to as "sidewalk café"). Licensees are eligible to apply for a sidewalk café
permit. A sidewalk café permit shall be valid for not more than twelve (12)
months at a time, but may be renewed upon the submission of a new application.
   (C)   The ABC Administrator may issue the permit if he or she finds that:
      (1)   The applicant is licensed under this chapter and the ABC Code for
the Commonwealth of Kentucky;
      (2)   The applicant is in compliance with all conditions and restrictions
of said license; including an accurate description of the property area to the
State ABC;
      (3)   The applicant has all necessary building and use permits, including
certification of the Zoning Administrator that the sidewalk café is permitted
at the premises location, in addition to a kitchen license, if applicable,
issued by the Woodford County Health Department; and

significant adverse land use impacts.

§ 120.47 CONDITIONS FOR SIDEWALK CAFÉ PERMIT.
   The issuance of a permit shall be subject to the following conditions and
restrictions; provided, however, that the ABC Administrator may without adverse
hearing procedures impose additional reasonable restrictions or withdraw
approval upon the operation of any sidewalk café where necessary in the
judgment of the said Administrator to protect the public health, safety or
welfare or to prevent a nuisance from developing or continuing. Specifically,
the permit may be revoked by the ABC Administrator if the conditions listed
below are violated or upon the violation of a federal, state or city law. The
permit will also be revoked if the food establishment has two (2) or more
violations of the nuisance ordinance found in this city code. If the permit is
revoked, the owner of the food establishment shall not be eligible to reapply
until one (1) year has passed from the date of the permit revocation.

to obstruct the entrance/exit to the establishment.

confined to the area shown on the approved permit. While such café is in
operation, all tables and chairs shall be kept in a clean, sanitary condition.

not be an exclusive use. All public improvements, including but not limited to,
trees, light poles, traffic signals, pull boxes or manholes, or any public-
initiated maintenance procedures, shall take precedence over said use of the
public sidewalk at all times.
   (D)   The licensee shall, in addition to all other requirements of law, take
reasonable steps to ensure that alcoholic beverages are consumed only by
patrons of the establishment who are of age, and not by passersby or persons
who are not of age or who are obviously or apparently intoxicated.
   (E)   No disposable cups or drinking vessels may be used and the licensee
shall not permit any alcoholic beverages to be taken off premises by patrons,
customers or guests.
   (F)   No amplified sound shall be used within a sidewalk café. At no time
shall any music originating from any part of the premises create a nuisance.
   (G)   Dancing shall not be permitted or allowed in the sidewalk café.
   (H)   The licensee must at all times comply with all federal, state and
local laws regarding the sale, service and consumption of alcohol and the
operation of the premises.

   No sidewalk café permit shall be effective unless the licensee has filed
with the ABC Administrator evidence of insurance insuring the licensee against
liability imposed by law arising out of the ownership, maintenance or operation
of such sidewalk café in an amount to be established by the city. The city
shall be named an additional insured in the policy, providing such insurance
and such policy shall further provide that it may not be canceled except upon
ten (10) day's written notice (or more) filed with the ABC Administrator.

half (½) of the suspension.
   (D)   Show cause hearing. Hearings on alleged violations shall be in the

the cost of any transcript or copy.
