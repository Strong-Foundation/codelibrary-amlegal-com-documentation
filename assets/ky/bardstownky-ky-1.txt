action in the circuit court in a county in which the subject of the complaint

of business, seeking appropriate temporary relief against the respondent,
pending final determination of proceedings before the Commission. Temporary
relief may include an order or decree restraining the respondent from doing or
procuring any act tending to render ineffectual any order the Commission may
enter with respect to the complaint. The court shall have power to grant such
temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.

complaint in the court. Copies of the complaint shall be served upon all
parties of record. Within 30 days after the service of the complaint upon the
Commission or its filing by the Commission, or within such further time as the
court may allow, the Commission shall transmit to the court the original or a

§ 41.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence. (KRS 61.872(6))
§ 41.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,

request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian’s authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
(KRS 61.880)
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General’s request,

reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General’s opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action. (KRS

Haven, and County of Nelson declare that:
   (A)   Public office and employment with the city/county are public trusts.

   (C)   The government of this city/county has a duty to provide its citizens
with standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being

standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.

that standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for
officers and employees of the city/county shall be clearly established, uniform
in their application and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees
of the city/county with advice and information concerning potential conflicts
of interest which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this ordinance to meet the requirements
of KRS 65.210 to 65.300 as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   This ordinance is enacted under the power vested in the city/county by
KRS 82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

and may:
      (1)   Due to mitigating circumstances such as, lack of significant
economic advantage or gain by the officer or employee, lack of economic loss to

§ 50.06 SURCHARGE.
   There is established and fixed as an add-on charge, referred to and
designated as a power cost adjustment (PCA) surcharge, which shall be charged
to each customer to recover the monthly change in cost of purchased wholesale
power and will reflect the fuel adjustment charge and annual changes to the
wholesale rate based on formulaic modification allowed by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, per FERC Docket No. ER08-1588-000, or as amended by
latest FERC-approved filing. The PCA is expressed as dollars per kWh and is
multiplied by the energy (kWh) sold during each billing period to each
customer. The PCA is designed to be calculated monthly based on actual power
costs and energy sales for the applicable month. The following formula has been
designed to calculate the PCA:
      PCA =      A/B - base rate where,
      PCA =      The cost adjustment expressed as dollars per kWh to be
multiplied by the energy (kWh) sold during each billing period to customers on
rates subject to the PCA.
      A =       Actual wholesale power cost for the applicable month (includes
all wholesale power costs as billed by Kentucky utilities).
      B =      Actual retail energy in kWh subject to the PCA for the
applicable month.
      Base Rate =   The base rate is the base wholesale power cost, exclusive
of SEPA power cost, expressed as dollars per kWh, included in, and used to
determine, the retail base rates established herein for all retail customers.
The base rate as of the effective date of this chapter is $0.06357.

§ 50.07 POWER FACTOR.
   (A)   The reference in this section to "power factor" or "pf" is in
accordance with the accepted technical meaning of this term.
   (B)   The city expects the customer’s electrical system to be at or near
unity power factor. However, the city will permit the customer’s system, during
normal operation, to have a power factor not lower than 90% either lagging or
leading. Where the customer’s power factor is less than 90%, the city reserves
the right to require the customer to furnish, at his or her own expense,
suitable corrective equipment to maintain a power factor of 90% or higher. At
the city’s option, in lieu of the customer providing the above corrective
equipment, the city may add an adjustment to the maximum measured kW load for
billing purposes each month when the power factor is less than 90%, in
accordance with the following formula:
(BASED ON POWER FACTOR MEASURED AT TIME OF MAXIMUM KW LOAD)
Maximum Measured kW Load x 90% - (Maximum Measured kW Load) = pf Correction kW

   (C)   The city reserves the right to install a KVA meter or metering
equipment of a type whereby power factor can be determined for use in the above
formula.

facility shall be limited to a maximum rated capacity of 45 kilowatts.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following words and
phrases shall have the following meanings ascribed to them respectively:
      (1)   "BILLING PERIOD." The time period between the dates on which the
city issues the customer's bills.
      (2)   "NET BILLING." The difference between the:
         (a)   Dollar value of any electricity generated by an eligible
customer-generator that is fed back to the electric grid over a billing period
and priced at the avoided wholesale power costs to the City of Bardstown; and
         (b)   Dollar value of all electricity consumed by the eligible
customer-generator over the same billing period and priced at that billing

      (1)   All solid waste, including yard waste and bulky rubbish, but
excluding solid waste stored for collection in city provided dumpsters, shall
be placed at the edge of the street, no closer than the property owner’s side

limbs, yard wastes, or other solid waste permitted by this ordinance to be
placed at the said location for collection shall be so placed by 7:00 a.m.

quantity and weight limits stated above. The duration of the emergency status
shall be defined by the Mayor or by the City Council as necessary.
         (a)   The intent of the bulky rubbish collection service is to pick up

Class V   Extra Labor Fee
   Customers who place solid waste for collection in containers not approved
under the provisions of this chapter and customers who place yard waste that is
not in an approved container are presumed to create extra labor costs for the
city’s collection service and are assessed a charge equal to that customer’s
monthly charge, as provided above, for each month or portion of a month that
the aforesaid actions occur, to cover that extra labor cost.
   (C) Cardboard collection. The city has added the service of cardboard
collection for businesses. The city will rent nine-yard cardboard containers to
businesses and charge for each pickup. The following collection rates are based
upon emptying the cardboard container and delivering the cardboard to the
recycling center.
Monthly Cardboard Rental Fee = $6.61

of service. All revenue from the sale of the collected cardboard goes to
Communicare. Other policies may be adopted to maintain and improve the
collaborative cardboard recycling efforts.

rates listed for each customer class for solid waste and cardboard collection,
on July 1 of each year, the city may adjust rates based upon the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) for the preceding year. Documentation for the CPI shall be
available from the U.S. Department of Labor.

      (1)   It is the purpose of this section to establish a program to assure
that the public water supply is protected from any auxiliary water supply which
may cause contamination due to backflow or cross-connections. The city
recognizes that contamination of the public water supply presents an imminent
health hazard to the residential and nonresidential users of the public water
system; the threat of significant economic loss due to disrupted water service
to such residential and nonresidential water users and the potential liability
to the city.
      (2)   It is the further purpose of this section to meet the requirements
of 401 KAR 8:020 as enacted by the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental
Protection Cabinet.
      (3)   This section is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of 401 KAR 8:020.
   (B)   Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context clearly
requires a different meaning:
      "AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY." Any water supply on or available to the
premises other than the city’s public water supply. These auxiliary waters may
include water from any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream or
body of water or any water or other substance of unknown or questionable
quality that may present a health or system hazard to the potable public water
supply.
      "BACKFLOW." The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either
back pressure or back siphonage.
      "BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY." An assembly or means designed to prevent
backflow. A listing of acceptable backflow prevention assemblies and degree of
hazard is available in the Kentucky State Plumbing Law, Regulations and Code.
      "CONTAMINATION." An impairment of the quality of the potable water supply
by any waste product, fluid, substance, compound or other material to a degree
which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through
poisoning or through the spread of disease.
      "CROSS-CONNECTION." Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems, one of which contains
potable water and the other nonpotable water or substance of questionable
quality, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur into the
potable water system.
      "THERMAL EXPANSION TANK." A device installed on the cold water supply
line near a water heater to compensate for the expansion of water within a
water system when such water is heated.
   (C)   Requirements. The city shall provide protection to the public water
system against backflow by implementing the following requirements.
      (1)   Residential. Buildings used for habitation or occupancy shall be
considered as residential buildings. No new water service connection to any
premises shall be installed or allowed to be installed by the city unless such
service connection is protected by a backflow prevention assembly. Residential
service connections shall be considered as low hazard applications and all such
connections shall have at a minimum a check valve backflow preventer installed
between the water meter and the residence. The city may require additional or
alternate backflow prevention assemblies if the degree of hazard constitutes a
higher level of protection for the public water system.
      (2)   Nonresidential. No new water service connection to any
nonresidential facility shall be installed or allowed to be installed by the
city unless such water service connection is protected by a backflow prevention
assembly. The type of protective device required shall be determined at the
time of installation of the service connection and shall be commensurate with
the degree of hazard at the point of such service connection. At a minimum, the
service connection shall be installed with a check valve backflow preventer. In
the event activities occur within a nonresidential facility changing and
creating a higher degree of hazard, then the backflow prevention assembly shall
be replaced with an assembly which provides acceptable protection.
      (3)   Inspections. The customer’s water system shall be open for
inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to
determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards,
including violation of this section, exist. When such a condition becomes
known, the city shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises
by providing a physical break in the service line until the customer has
corrected the condition in conformance with the state and city statutes
relating to plumbing, water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuantly
thereto. Water service to any premises shall be discontinued if it is found
that a backflow prevention assembly required by this section has been removed,
bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service
will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
      (4)   Existing service connections. All existing water service
connections which do not have backflow prevention assemblies or existing water
service connections which have less than the minimum required backflow
prevention assemblies, shall, except for the inspection requirements, be
excluded from the requirements of this section so long as the city is assured
that the public water system is satisfactorily protected. However, if the city
determines that a hazard to health exists, then a backflow prevention assembly
meeting the requirements of this section may be installed on such existing
service connection. Backflow prevention assembly shall not be installed on
existing service connections until after the property owner of such residential
or commercial property has been informed of the actual and potential hazards
that may be created as a result of such backflow assembly installation. Notices
provided to such property owners shall include the following language as
adopted in 815 KAR 20:120 Section 2. item (6): When cross-connection control
devices are properly installed, they create a closed water system. A properly
sized thermal expansion tank shall be installed in the cold water supply
located as near the water heater as possible.

§ 53.090 ALTERNATIVE DISCHARGE LIMITS.
   (A)   Where an effluent from categorical industrial process(es) is mixed
prior to treatment with wastewater other than those generated by the regulated
process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge
permit by the Superintendent. These alternative limits shall be applied to the
mixed effluent and shall be calculated using the Combined Wastestream Formula
and/or Flow-Weighted Average Formula as defined in §§ 53.01 through 53.02.
   (B)   Where the effluent limits in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production
(production-based standard), the Superintendent may convert the limits to
equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day
or of effluent concentration for purposed of calculating effluent permit
limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be subject to all
permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully
comply with these alternative limits.
   (C)   All categorical users subject to production-based standards must
report production rates annually so that alternative permits can be calculated
if necessary. The categorical user must notify the Superintendent 30 days in
advance of any major change in production levels that will affect the limits
for the discharge permit.

§ 53.122 SEWER RATES.
   (A)   The city shall assess a standard charge per unit volume of metered
water for all residential users and other users who produce wastewater which
does not differ significantly from normal domestic wastewater. The standard
unit charge shall be based on a standard concentration of BOD and suspended
solids as established by the city, a wastewater/water ratio of 90%, and the
proportionate costs of operation, maintenance and equipment replacement costs
of the sewerage
facilities. A minimum monthly user fee shall be established for all sewer users
that covers basic costs to provide service regardless of the volume discharged.
This base service rate includes up to 2,000 gallons of metered water and covers
such costs for collection, treatment, billing, debt service, OM&R, etc. This is
referred to in the below rate table as "minimum bill." The city shall review
the standard charge annually and shall revise it periodically to reflect actual
costs of operation and maintenance. 
   (B)   For multiple unit residential and commercial buildings where each unit
does not have separate metering devices, the owner shall be responsible to pay
for sewer service according to the rates as listed above for metered
consumption and further pay monthly minimum sewer charges for each unit after
the first unit. The monthly minimum sewer charges for each unit may be paid by
owner or tenant as requested by the owner, provided the tenant has a city water
or electric account on to which the minimum sewer charge can be placed.
   (C)   Customers outside city limits. The city shall assess all users
(residential, commercial, and industrial) located outside the city limits
charges proportional to the cost for OM&R of the transportation system to cover
the cost incurred in delivering the wastewater to the city limits and the
Bardstown WWTP. These fees shall be based on the volume of water used and shall
be in addition to any other fees noted in this chapter. The OM&R user fees
determined for services provided outside the city limits shall be evaluated
annually and the fees adjusted as needed to recover cost incurred.
   (D)   Composite Base Sewer Rate Table. The rates and charges for domestic/
commercial/industrial sewer service shall be based insofar as possible upon the
quantity of water supplied to the respective premises as noted in §§
53.120 -
53.122 of this chapter. A minimum monthly user fee shall be established for all

ENFORCEMENT
§ 53.150 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A) The city, through the Superintendent or their designee, to insure
compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40 CFR Subchapter N, and
401 KAR 5:055, may take the following enforcement steps against users in non-
compliance with the chapter. The remedies available to the POTW include
injunctive relief, civil and criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of
discharges and/or water service and the publishing of the list of significant
violators annually. The enforcement authority shall be vested in the
Superintendent or their designee.
   (B) The Superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or
an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit when such suspension is necessary, in
the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the
POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES Permit.
   (C) Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed
necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city
shall reinstate the Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit and/or the
wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying
discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrences shall be submitted to the city within 15 days of the date of
occurrence.
(Ord. 477, passed 7-24-91)
§ 53.151 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A) Any user found to be violating any provisions of this chapter,
wastewater permit, or any order issued hereunder, shall be served by the city
with written notice stating the nature of the violations and providing a
reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender
shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all
violations. Within 10 days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
potential liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the
Notice of Violation.
   (B) For all violations, the Superintendent shall receive an explanation and,
as appropriate, a plan from the industrial user to correct a violation within a
specific time period. If the violations persist or the explanation and/or plan
are not adequate, the city’s response shall be more formal and commitments (or
schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in an enforceable
document. The enforcement response selected will be related to the seriousness
of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if compliance is not
achieved expeditiously after the initial action. A significant non-compliance
as defined in §
53.100 will require a formal enforcement action.
   (C) The full scale of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the
Enforcement Response Plan.
(Ord. 477, passed 7-24-91) Penalty, see §

discharge in violation of this chapter or other pretreatment standards or
requirement or is determined to be a chronic or persistent violator or who is
determined to be a significant violator, shall be ordered to appear before the
city. At said appearance, a compliance schedule will be given to the non-
conforming user and an administrative fine assessed. The fine shall be
determined on a case-by-case basis which shall consider the type and severity
of violations, duration of violation, number of violations, severity of impact
on the POTW, impact on human health, users economic benefit from violation,
history of violations, good faith of the user, and shall be a non-arbitrary but
appropriate amount.

      (1) Consent orders. The Superintendent or their designee is hereby
empowered to enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user
responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to
be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period also specified by the order. Consent Orders shall have the same force
and effect as orders issued pursuant to division (B) (3) of this section.
      (2) Compliance orders. When the Superintendent or their designee finds
that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the chapter or a
permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user
responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are
properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be
reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including
the installation of pretreatment technology, additional selfmonitoring, and
management practices.
      (3) Cease and desist orders. When the Superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit

   It is hereby found, determined and declared that the facts and recitals set
forth in the preamble of Ordinance B2010-09 are true and correct and are hereby
affirmed. Such facts and recitals, including the terms defined therein, are
adopted and incorporated as a part of this chapter.
(Ord. B2010-09, passed 6-15-10)
§ 55.02 COLLECTION AND APPLICATION OF REVENUES OF SYSTEM.
   The gross income and revenues of the system shall be set aside into a
separate and special fund designated the Combined Utilities System Revenue Fund
("Revenue Fund") to be used and apportioned as follows:
   (A)   (1)   There shall be set aside from the Revenue Fund such portion
thereof as will be sufficient to pay the interest on and the principal of any
bonds of the city issued to finance improvements to the system ("bonds"). Such
portion shall be deposited in a Utilities System Bond Payment Account of the
city ("Bond Fund"), which shall be used for the payment, or reimbursement to
the city for payment, when due of interest on and principal of the bonds ("Bond
Fund obligations").
      (2)   Such payments into the Bond Fund for the Bond Fund obligations
shall be made in equal monthly installments on or before the tenth day of each
month, and it is hereby determined that the minimum amounts to be paid into the
Bond Fund each month for the Bond Fund obligations shall be as follows:
         (a)   An amount which together with other funds available for such
purpose will be equal to one-sixth of the interest falling due on the bond fund
obligations on the next succeeding interest payment date shall be deposited in
the Bond Fund; provided that no later than the tenth day of the month before
the first interest payment date following the issuance of the any bonds, there
shall be paid into the Bond Fund the amount of any deficiency in the amount of
interest to be due on such first interest payment date.
         (b)   An amount which together with other funds available for such
purpose will be equal to one-twelfth of the principal amount of the Bond Fund
obligations coming due on the next principal payment date shall be deposited in
the principal account.
      (3)   No further payments need be made into the Bond Fund when the amount
then held in the Bond Fund is at least equal to the entire amount required for
retiring all outstanding bonds and paying all interest that will accrue at the
time of such retirement.
      (4)   If for any reason there should be a failure to pay into the Bond
Fund the full amount above stipulated, then an amount equivalent to such
deficiency shall be set apart and paid into the Bond Fund from the first
available income and revenues.
      (5)   All moneys held in the Bond Fund, shall be deposited in a bank or
banks which are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC")
or one of its agencies and all such deposits which cause the aggregate deposits
of the city in any one bank to be in excess of the amount insured by the FDIC
or one of its agencies shall be continuously secured by a valid pledge of
direct obligations of the United States of America having an equivalent market
value. All or any part of the Bond Fund may, be invested in investment
obligations, as defined in this chapter, maturing or being subject to
retirement at the option of the holder on such dates as the same may be needed
for meeting interest and/or principal payments and all such investments shall
be carried to the credit of the Bond Fund.
      (6)   It is specifically acknowledged and ordered that the revenue of the
system and amounts in the Bond Fund are not pledged to or hereby for the
benefit of the holders of any bonds and that the provisions of this division
(B) are enacted solely for the administration, convenience and benefit of city
government.
   (B)   (1)   There shall be continued an account of the city known as the
Depreciation Fund, and from the balance of the income and revenues remaining
after the aforesaid payments into the Bond Fund there shall be set aside on or
before the tenth day of each month into the Depreciation Fund at least 10% of
the balance remaining in the Revenue Fund or at least $10,000, whichever is
greater, until there is accumulated and there is being maintained in the
Depreciation Fund a balance of at least $500,000, being the required minimum
balance for the Depreciation Fund. Whenever withdrawals are made from the
Depreciation Fund reducing the balance therein to less than such minimum
balance, the prescribed payments shall continue to be made therein so as to
restore the amount to at least such minimum balance. The Depreciation Fund
shall be used to provide reasonable reserves for renewals, replacements,
improvements, extensions, extraordinary major repairs and contingencies in the
operation of the system, provided also that withdrawals may be made from the
Depreciation Fund to fund any deficiency in the Bond Fund.
      (2)   All funds in the Depreciation Fund shall be kept apart from all
other municipal funds and shall be deposited and secured in the same manner as
herein provided for the deposit and security of the Bond Fund, or all or any
part of the Depreciation Fund may be invested in the same manner as herein
provided for the investment of moneys in the Bond Fund, and all such
investments shall be carried to the credit of the Depreciation Fund and the
income from such investments shall be credited to the Depreciation Fund.
   (C)   There shall be continued an account of the city known as the Operation
and Maintenance Fund, and from the balance of the income and revenues remaining
after the aforesaid payments into the Bond Fund and the Depreciation Fund there
shall be set aside on or before the tenth day of each month into the Operation
and Maintenance Fund such amount as may be determined, pursuant to an annual
budget for the system which shall be adopted annually by the City Council (and
which the Council may amend from time to time), to be necessary and sufficient
to pay the reasonable and current expenses of operating, maintaining and
insuring the system for the current and the next ensuing months. After the
tenth day of each month further transfers may be made in like manner only if
and to the extent it may be found to be necessary to pay such expenses actually
accrued and payable. All funds in the Operating and Maintenance Fund shall be
kept apart from all other municipal funds and shall be deposited and secured in
the same manner as herein provided for the deposit and security of the Bond
Fund, or all or any part of the Operation and Maintenance Fund may be invested
in the same manner as herein provided for the investment of moneys in the Bond
Fund, and all such investments shall be carried to the credit of the Operation
and Maintenance Fund and the income from such investments shall be credited to
the Operation and Maintenance Fund.
   (D)   Whenever, at the end of any fiscal year, all specified and required
transfers and payments into the special funds hereinbefore provided have been
made and there is a balance in the Revenue Fund in excess of the amounts
required to be transferred during the first two months of the ensuing fiscal
year into said special funds, all or any part of such excess may be used as
follows:
      (1)   To retire or redeem any debt obligation of the city issued to
finance improvements to the system, as may be determined by the City Council;
      (2)   To transfer additional amounts to the Operation and Maintenance
Fund;
      (3)   To transfer additional amounts to the Depreciation Fund; or
      (4)   For any other lawful corporate purpose of the city.

(Ord. B2010-09, passed 6-15-10)
§ 55.04 RATE PROVISIONS.
   (A)   While the Bond Fund obligations remain outstanding and unpaid, the
rates for all services rendered by the system to the city, its citizens,
corporations and other consumers shall be reasonable and just, taking into
account and consideration the cost and value of the properties constituting the
system and the cost of maintaining and operating the same, and the proper and
necessary allowances for depreciation thereof, and the amounts necessary for
the retirement of all bonds and notes and the accruing of interest on all such
obligations as may be issued and outstanding. There shall be charged against
all users of the services and facilities of the system, including the city,
such rates and amounts as shall be adequate to meet the requirements of this
section. Compensation for services rendered to the city shall be charged
against the city and payment for same from the corporate funds of the city
shall be apportioned as other income and revenues.
   (B)   The city will not reduce the rates and charges for services rendered
by the system without first filing with the City Clerk a written certification
prepared by the Chief Financial Officer and verified by an independent third
party having a recognized level of expertise in the costing and pricing of
utility services and being a certified public accountant or firm of certified
public accountants licensed in Kentucky, a consulting engineer or firm of
consulting engineers licensed in Kentucky, or an independent agency, such as
the Kentucky Rural Water Association (each, an "independent third party"), to
the effect that the annual net revenues of the then existing system for the
fiscal year preceding the date on which such reduction is proposed, as such
annual net revenues are adjusted after taking into account the projected
reduction in revenues anticipated to result from such proposed rate decrease,
are equal to not less than 140% of the maximum amount of the Bond Fund
obligations in any year ("maximum annual debt service").
   (C)   The city will also cause a report to be filed with the City Clerk
within six months after the end of each fiscal year by the Chief Financial
Officer and verified by an independent third party, setting forth the
percentage ("coverage") of the maximum annual debt service produced or provided
by the net revenues of the system in that fiscal year; and if and whenever such
report so filed shall establish that such coverage of net revenues for such
fiscal year was less than 120% of the maximum annual debt service, the city
shall increase the rates charged the users of the system by an amount
sufficient, in the opinion of the Chief Financial Officer, to establish the
existence of or immediate accomplishment of such minimum 120% coverage.
   (D)   For purposes of this section, "NET REVENUES" shall mean gross income
and revenues of the system less operating expenses, which shall include
salaries, wages, costs of maintenance and operation, materials and supplies,
cost of electricity purchased, pumping costs and insurance, as well as all
other items that are normally and regularly so included under recognized
accounting practices, exclusive of allowance for depreciation. The net revenues
may be adjusted for the purpose of the foregoing computations to reflect any
revision in the schedule of rates or charges being imposed at the time of
calculation, and also to reflect any increase in such net income and revenues
by reason of the extensions, additions and improvements to the system the cost
of which (in whole or in part) is to be paid through the issuance of additional
bonds; but such latter adjustments shall only be made if contracts for the
immediate construction or acquisition of such extensions, additions and
improvements have been or will be entered into before the issuance of such
additional bonds. All such adjustments shall be based upon a written
certification of the Chief Financial Officer and verified by an independent
third party.
(Ord. B2010-09, passed 6-15-09)
§ 55.05 BILLING; WHEN DUE; PENALTY.
   (A)   All customers will be billed monthly. Billing dates for groups of
accounts shall be as deemed appropriate by the CFO or officer in charge of
billing. Billing dates shall be on or near the first, seventh, fifteenth, or
twenty-first of each month. Each bill shall show the charge for each of the
services on that account. All bills shall be paid by the due date shown on such
bills and all bills not paid by such time shall be subject to discontinuance of
any or all services. One late or delinquent notice shall be rendered after the
due date for each unpaid bill and shall give the customer notice that service
may be disconnected on the tenth day after the notice is rendered. A late fee
of 5% of the unpaid charges or $3.50, whichever is the greater, shall be added
to the account and shall be paid by the specified disconnect date.
   (B)   All payments to accounts are applied proportionately to the service
charges rendered, unless a customer, in writing to the CFO, specifies that the
payment is for particular service. All payments may be applied to past due
charges first and then current charges.
   (C)   If payment of the account balance is not received by the city by the
disconnect date, any and/or all services may be disconnected, provided however
that if only cable service is unpaid, no other service shall be disconnected
and provided that if a particular service is paid in full, that service cannot
be disconnected. A disconnect fee will be charged to each account disconnected.
That fee will be $25 for customer accounts within the Bardstown city limits or
S40 for all other customers. The fee will be charged for each truck roll to
that house to disconnect a specific service. The city shall charge only a $10
disconnect fee if the only service disconnected is Internet and if that
disconnect is done from the office.
   (D)   Reconnection of service shall be made only after payment of all
current and past-due bills and account balances and after the customer requests
a reconnect. Reconnection of service will be performed as staff’s work
schedules permit, typically next business day for water or electric and three
business days for cable. Reconnection of Internet disconnected from the office
will be made during office hours on the day payment is received and
reconnection is requested.

   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend or symbolic message, and
the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as
follows:
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a
turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
      (4)   Vehicular traffic that entered an intersection on a circular green
or yellow indication is allowed to complete a left turn during the red
indication.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian-control signal, are thereby advised that there is
sufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no
pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown,
except as follows:
         (a)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by (C)(1)
above, with the intention of making a right turn, may make such right turn,
after stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such
movement, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic
lawfully proceeding through the intersection;
         (b)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by division
(C)(1) above whose vehicle is in the left lane of a one-way highway with the
intention of making a left turn onto the left lane of another one-way highway
with the flow of traffic, may make such left turn, after stopping, unless an
official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of- way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding through the
intersection; and
          (c)   In instances where there are two right or left turn lanes, an
allowable turn under this section may be made from either lane unless a
regulatory sign specifically prohibits it.
      (2)   The Council may prohibit any such right or left turn against a
steady red signal at any intersection, which prohibition shall be effective
when an official sign prohibiting such movement is erected at the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (E)   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow light is used in a
traffic signal or with a traffic sign it shall require obedience by vehicular
traffic as follows:
      (1)   Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with
rapid intermittent flashes, operators of vehicles shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side
of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting
roadway where the operator has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering it, and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign; and
      (2)   Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, operators of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   (F)   Any person operating a motorcycle who violates division (C) above by
crossing an intersection controlled by a traffic control signal against a
steady red light shall have an affirmative defense to that charge if the person
establishes all of the following conditions:
      (1)   The motorcycle was brought to a complete stop;
      (2)   The traffic control signal continued to show a steady red light for
120 seconds or the traffic control signal at the intersection has completed two
lighting cycles;
      (3)   The traffic control signal was apparently malfunctioning or, if
programmed or engineered to change to a green light only after detecting the
approach of a motor vehicle, the signal apparently failed to detect the arrival
of a motorcycle; and
      (4)   No motor vehicle or person was approaching on the street or highway
to be crossed or entered, or any approaching person or vehicle was so far away
from the intersection that it did not constitute an immediate hazard.
   (G)   The affirmative defense outlined in division (F) above shall only
apply to a violation for entering or crossing an intersection controlled by a
traffic signal against a steady red light and shall not provide a defense to
any other civil or criminal action.
   (H)   In the event a motorcyclist exercises the affirmative defense
provisions set forth in division (F) above, the Transportation Cabinet or its
employees are specifically immune from any and all civil liability arising from
any such claim, lawsuit, or dispute. Any claim, lawsuit, or dispute against the
Transportation Cabinet as a result of the affirmative defense set forth in
division (F) above, shall be brought using the provisions outlined in KRS
Chapter 44.

or the traffic officer or other vehicles or pedestrians, nor shall he increase
the speed of his vehicle or extinguish the lights of his vehicle in an attempt
to elude or flee.

equipment which is involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of
any person or resulting only in damage to a vehicle or other property which is
driven or attended by any person shall immediately stop and ascertain the
extent of the injury or damage and render reasonable assistance, including the

to such intersections.
   (D)   Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, every operator of
a vehicle approaching a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but
if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection,
or, if none, than at the point nearest the intersecting roadway when the
operator has view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before
entering it. After having stopped the operator shall yield the right-of-way to
any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as
to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such operator is moving
across or within the intersection or junction of roadways.
   (E)   The operator of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall in obedience
to the sign slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and, if
required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if
none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or,
if none than at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the operator
has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering
it. After slowing and stopping, the operator shall yield the right-of-way to
any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as
to constitute an immediate hazard during he time the operator is moving across
or within the intersection or junction of roadways. However, if such an
operator is involved in a collision with a vehicle in the intersection or
junction of roadways after driving past a yield sign without stopping, such
collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his failure to yield right-
of-way.
   (F)   The operator of a vehicle intending to turn shall do so as follows:
      (1)   Right turns. Both the approach for a right turn and a right turn
shall be made as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the
roadway;
      (2)   Left turns. The operator of a vehicle intending to turn left shall
approach the turn in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic
moving in the direction of travel of the vehicle. Whenever practicable the left
turn shall be made to the left of the center of the intersection and so as to
leave the intersection or other location in the extreme right-hand lane
lawfully available to traffic moving in the same direction as the vehicle on
the roadway being entered.
   (G)   The city may cause official traffic-control devices to be placed and
thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in this
section be traveled by turning vehicles and when the devices are so placed no
operator shall turn a vehicle other than as directed and required by the
devices.
   (H)   The operator of any vehicle shall not turn the vehicle so as to
proceed in the opposite direction unless such movement can be made in safety
without interfering with other traffic.
   (I)   The operator of a vehicle intending to turn to the left within an
intersection or into an alley, private road, or driveway shall yield the right-
of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within
the intersection or so close thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
   (J)   The operator of a vehicle about to enter or cross a roadway from any
place other than another roadway shall yield the right-of- way to all vehicles
approaching on the roadway to be entered or crossed.
   (K)   On highways with a center lane restricted for left turns off the
highway by vehicles proceeding in both directions:
      (1)   A left turn shall not be made from any other lane; and
      (2)   A vehicle shall not be driven in a center lane as described in this
subsection except when preparing for or making a left turn off the highway or
merging onto the highway after making a left turn from a side road or other
entrance.

70.99(A)
§ 72.05 OVERTAKING VEHICLES; TRAFFIC LANES; FOLLOWING VEHICLES.
   (A)   The driver of a vehicle overtaking other vehicles proceeding in the
same direction shall pass to the left of them and shall not again drive to the
right until reasonably clear of those vehicles. The driver of a vehicle
overtaking street cars may pass either to the right or left when so directed by
a police officer, when on a one-way street or where the location of the tracks
prevents compliance with this section, with regard for other traffic. (KRS
189.340(1))

(KRS 189.340(4))
   (D)   A person shall not drive a vehicle to the left side of the center of
the roadway in overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction unless the left side is clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic
for a sufficient distance ahead to permit overtaking and passing to be
completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any vehicle
approaching from the opposite direction or any vehicle overtaken. In every
event the overtaking vehicle must return to the right-hand side of the roadway
before coming within 200 feet of any vehicle approaching from the opposite
direction. (KRS 189.340(5))
   (E)   Whenever any roadway has been divided into three or more clearly
marked lanes for travel in one direction, the following additional rules shall

entirely within a single lane and shall not move from that lane until the
driver ascertains that the movement can be made with safety;
      (2)   A person shall not drive a vehicle in the center lane except when
overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly visible and
the center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation
for a left turn or where a center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to
traffic moving in the direction in which the vehicle is proceeding and is
signposted to give notice of the allocation;
      (3)   A person shall not operate a truck tractor, trailer, or semitrailer
in the leftmost lane except when entering or leaving a highway, yielding to
traffic coming onto the highway, or when traffic conditions exist which would
prohibit safe use of the right or center lanes; and
      (4)   Official signs may be erected directing slow-moving traffic to use
a designated lane or allocating specified lanes to traffic moving in the same
direction and operators of vehicles shall obey the directions of these signs.
(KRS 189.340(7))
   (F)   On any limited access highway of four lanes or more with a posted
speed limit of at least 65 miles per hour, a person shall not operate a motor
vehicle in the leftmost lane, except when:
      (1)   Overtaking a slower vehicle;
      (2)   Yielding to traffic coming onto the highway; or
      (3)   Traffic conditions exist which would prohibit safe use of the right
or center lane. (KRS 189.340(8))
   (G)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (G)(3) below, the operator of a
motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable
and prudent, having regard for the speed of the vehicle and the traffic upon
and condition of the highway.

motor truck, semitrailer truck, bus or heavy construction equipment unit when
traveling upon a highway outside of a business or residential district shall
not follow within 250 feet of another such vehicle or equipment unit. This
subsection shall not prevent overtaking and passing, nor shall it apply to any
lane specially designated for use of motor trucks or semitrailer trucks, busses
or heavy construction equipment units.
      (3)   Subsections (G)(1) and (G)(2) above shall not apply to a trailing
commercial motor vehicle involved in a platoon as defined in KRS 281.010, but

70.99(A)
§ 72.07 PASSING CARS RECEIVING OR DISCHARGING PASSENGERS.
   (A)   Whenever a car traveling upon rails placed in the center or
approximate center of a highway is stopped for the purpose of receiving or
discharging passengers, every operator of a vehicle approaching the car from
the rear and proceeding in the same direction shall bring his vehicle to a full
stop and shall not start up or attempt to pass until the car has finished
receiving or discharging passengers.
   (B)   Where safety aisles of reasonable size are established, leaving space
between the track and the curb or edge of the highway sufficient for the
passage of traffic, overtaking vehicles shall pass between the aisle and the
curb or edge of the highway, without observing subsection (A).

   SMOKE DETECTORS
§ 95.20 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "DWELLING." Any building which contains one or more dwelling units or any

including mobile homes and forming a single housekeeping unit with facilities
which are used or designed to be used for living, sleeping, cooking, or eating.
   "OWNER." Any person who, alone, jointly, or severally with others:
      (1)   Shall have all or part of the legal title to any dwelling or
dwelling unit, with or without accompanying actual possession thereof, or shall
have all or part of the beneficial ownership or any dwelling or dwelling unit
and a right to present use and enjoyment thereof, including a mortgage in
possession; or
      (2)   Shall have charge, care, or control of any dwelling or dwelling
unit as owner, or as executor, administrator, trustee, guardian of the estate,

(Ord. 458, passed - - )
§ 95.21 SMOKE DETECTORS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Subject to such exceptions and conditions for compliance as stated
herein, six months after the effective date of this chapter, smoke detectors
shall be required in all dwellings privately owned or rented for occupancy. It
shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new and/or existing occupied
dwelling unit to install smoke detectors in each dwelling unit as hereinafter
provided. Said smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing visible or invisible
particles of combustion and providing a suitable audible (or visual for the
deaf or hearing impaired) alarm.
   (B)   This chapter shall apply to any and all dwellings or dwelling units,
new or existing, which do not fall under the jurisdiction of the currently
adopted Kentucky Building Code and/or the currently adopted Life Safety Code
(LSC 101).
(Ord. 458, passed - - )
§ 95.22 TYPE AND PLACEMENT OF SMOKE DETECTORS.
   (A)   (1)   In order to comply with this chapter, only ionization or
photoelectric type detectors approved by a nationally recognized testing
laboratory shall be installed.
      (2)   As an alternative to self-contained smoke detectors, under certain
limited conditions, an approved fire detection system or a combination thereof
may be installed. Each and every alternative system must be individually
approved in written form by the Bureau of Fire Prevention of the Bardstown Fire
Department.
   (B)   Smoke detectors in new residential dwellings shall be wired directly
(hard wired) to the building’s power supply. In existing buildings, it is
preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power supply; however,
said detectors may be powered by self- monitored battery or operated by an
electrical plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device,
provided that the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the main
power supply.
   (C)   Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with applicable N.F.P.A.
Standards (see §
95.24). Detectors may be ceiling or wall mounted, provided that if wall mounted
they shall be within 12 inches, but not closer than six inches to the ceiling.
   (D)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area. A sleeping area is defined as the area or areas of the dwelling
unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping rooms) are located. Where bedrooms or
rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other use areas (such as
kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section. In a
dwelling unit which contains a well defined sleeping room separated from the
other activity areas of the same unit, the detector shall be located in the
corridor within the unit or interior area giving access to the rooms used for
sleeping purposes. Where sleeping areas are separated and/or where a single
smoke detector will not adequately service all sleeping areas, there shall be a
smoke detector installed adjacent to each sleeping area.
   (E)   In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally located on the
ceiling.
   (F)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any rooming
unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each
dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally located
common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately service all sleeping
areas.
   (G)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed in or near each
stairway leading up to an occupied area in such a manner as to assure that
rising smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector and the detector
intercepts rising smoke before it reaches the occupied area.
(Ord. 458, passed - - )
§ 95.23 PROVIDING, INSTALLING AND MAINTAINING SMOKE DETECTORS.
   (A)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for supplying and
installing in an operable condition the required detector(s) and for providing
maintenance and testing in an owner occupied residence; or for providing the
manufacturer’s maintenance and testing instructions to a tenant in the case of
rental property.
   (B)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for maintenance and
testing of detectors, in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions, which are
located in common areas and/or detectors in rooming units where the tenant
usually has short periods of occupancy (hotels, motels, rooming or tourist
homes).
   (C)   The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and testing the
detector, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, which are within
his exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant shall be
responsible for notifying the owner when a detector becomes inoperable,
whereafter the owner has ten days in which to repair or replace in operable
conditions said detector(s). In the battery operated type of detectors, battery
replacement shall be the responsibility of the tenant.
   (D)   At every change of tenancy, it shall be the duty of the owner to test
and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and, if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition.
   (E)   At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by or
incidental to a sale, lease or sub-lease of said unit, it shall be the duty of
the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor, or sub-lessor, as the case may
be) to provide, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke detectors
are required by this section (or other applicable laws) are installed and in
proper working condition. Failure to comply with this division (E) shall be
punishable as set forth herein, provided however, that this division (E) shall
not be construed to violate or render void any contract, lease or sub-lease
subject hereto.
   (F)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly connected
(permanently wired) to the electrical system of a structure without the proper
electrical certification.
(Ord. 458, passed - - )
§ 95.24 SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS.
   This section is intended to be used with, and supplemented by, the
applicable provisions of the National Fire Protection Standards 72-E and 74
(current edition) which are hereby incorporated herein; however, if there shall
be any conflict between this chapter and the said supplemental standards, this
chapter and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall prevail.
All amendments to or changes in N.F.P.A. Nos. 72-E and 74 shall be adopted and
made part thereof without further reference.

be primarily responsible for the enforcement of this chapter.
   (B)   The City Building Department shall assist the Bureau by making
referrals to the Bureau as part of its regular instruction and enforcement of
all city housing, building and safety codes. No building permits for remodeling
or repair of a dwelling unit shall be issued for any dwelling unit not properly
equipped with said detectors. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for
any new dwelling or dwelling unit not properly equipped with said detectors.
Detectors must be operable for the final inspection of the City Building
Inspector and/or Fire Prevention Bureau Inspector. Instructions/maintenance
booklets must be provided to the owner by the manufacturer as per N.F.P.A. No.
74, and said documentation displayed to the Building Inspector(s) during the
final inspection.

(Ord. 459, passed 1-8-91)
§ 96.32 SIDEWALK REPLACEMENT POLICY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this section for the city and property owners to
share equal costs in the repair and replacement of existing deteriorated
concrete sidewalks within the city limits. The primary goal is to remediate
sidewalks that present a tripping hazard in accordance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA). Sidewalks that cross private drives and entrances are
not subject to this replacement policy as this falls under perpetual
maintenance by the property owner for right-of-way encroachments. As stated in
§
96.11, any sidewalk or curb damaged is not subject to the replacement policy.
The city encourages property owners to replace concrete sidewalks with brick or
other historic decorative surfaces in the downtown and other appropriate areas.
All city participation in sidewalk replacement must be specifically approved by
the Office of the City Engineer.
      (1)   The city shall calculate the cost for replacement and reimbursement
based on the "Fee Schedule Encroachment Work and Land Disturbance Activities,"
as approved by the governing body, hereafter referred to as the "Fee Schedule".
Sidewalk replacement must begin and end at concrete expansion joints.
      (2)   Where the City Engineer, Public Works Superintendent or Code
Enforcement Officer identifies the existence of holes, uneven surfaces or other
defects in sidewalks or curb and gutter that create a hazard to public safety,
the owner of the property abutting the sidewalk/curb shall be notified in
writing of the location and affected area (square feet) that must be replaced.
   (B)   Property owners may choose one of the following replacement options:
      (1)   Replace the sidewalk in accordance with city specifications
themselves or hire a contractor. A permit is required for property owners and/
or contractors that will be performing any work within the right-of-way. Upon
completion of the work, the permit will be released and the city will reimburse
the property owner half the value of the work in accordance with the Fee
Schedule (where vehicular traffic is anticipated the sidewalk shall be six
inches thick); or
      (2)   Send a written request to the Office of the City Engineer for City
Public Works to replace the sidewalk and/or curb and gutter abutting their
property. Upon completion of the work, the City will bill the property owner
for half the cost of the sidewalk replacement, including labor and materials,
based on the Fee Schedule. Payment will be due within 30 days of receipt.
   (C)   The city's reimbursement contribution shall not exceed $750 for
properties with single frontage and $1,200 for properties with frontage on two
sides.
   (D)   In the Bardstown Historical District and in the Central Business
District (Both sides of the street in the 100 block of East and West Stephen
Foster Avenue and East and West Flaget, around the Court Square, and the one
and two hundred block of North Third Street). The city will reimburse the
property owner one half the actual cost of brick sidewalk installed per the
city specifications. In the Central Business District all sidewalk replacements
will be brick and/or other surface material which has been approved by the
Historic Review Board.
   (E)   The policy described herein is not intended to apply to aesthetic
concerns. Replacement refers to removal of the existing sidewalk, installing of
the new walk, additional stone bedding as necessary, and backfilling with
topsoil, seed and straw.
   (F)   The city reserves the right to determine the type of brick or other
approved surface material used in this program and to approve the cost estimate
for brick work to be reimbursed at one half cost.

public ways, and that portion of any street abutting upon property belonging to
the city; if any property abutting on the improvement be owned by the county,
the county shall pay such portion of the tax as may be assessed against it;
subject to the city’s right to collect same, as provided in the Kentucky
Revised Statutes.
§ 96.34 NEW STREETS BY PRIVATE CONTRACTOR; APPROVAL OF EXTENSION BY CITY
COUNCIL.

proposed public street improvements with a private contractor and the cost of
such construction shall be paid for by the property owners or developers.

accordance with specifications approved by the Office of the City Engineer and

§ 98.06 GENERAL SIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   The information contained within this section is intended to be used as
criteria in all sections of this chapter; however, there may be areas that
require more detail or explanation. In those cases, the information in those
sections shall be used. No variances will be allowed.
   (A)   General sign requirements. All signs shall comply with the following
general sign requirements:
      (1)   No sign shall be placed in a manner visible from any public street,
alley, right-of-way, sidewalk, or other public easement, except as provided
herein, nor shall any sign be placed in or extend over street, right-of-way,
roadway, sidewalk, public or private utility or access or other easement, or
alley, except as provided herein and with the approval of the appropriate
agency or utility. Any sign installed or placed on or over public property or
right-of-way after of adoption of this chapter, except in conformance with
these requirements, shall be forfeited to the public and subject to
confiscation. In addition to other remedies hereunder, the city shall have the
right to recover from the owner or person placing such a sign the full cost of
removal and disposal of the sign.
      (2)     All signs allo wed here under shal l be cons tructed and placed
so as not to obstruct the vision of the public at any street, alley, or
driveway. Signs otherwise permitted by this chapter may be located within the
sight distance triangl e, as shown below, provided that no part of such sign
exceeds a horizontal dimensi on of 12 inches between the height of two and one-
half (2-1/5) feet and twelve (12) feet above the average grade of each street,
alley, or driveway. See illustrations below for visual clearance and sight
distance triangle.

Illustration 6-2. Sight distance triangle
      (3)   No sign shall be allowed to be illuminated, except as expressly
provided herein. Signs which are otherwise allowed to be illuminated are not
allowed if the Sign Administrator finds that the lighting adversely affects
adjoining residential uses or causes glare or otherwise interferes with the
vision of persons operating motor vehicles. All illuminated signs shall not be
flashing or pulsating and shall be constant in intensity and color, unless
otherwise allowed herein. Sign lighting shall be directed away from all traffic
and from all adjoining residential properties, and the lighting intensity shall
not exceed 15 foot candles at any point on the sign face.
      (4)   No sign shall be allowed to revolve, rotate, or move, unless
otherwise expressly provided herein.
      (5)   No sign shall be allowed if the Sign Administrator finds that the
sign is constructed or designed in a manner which may cause the sign to be
confused with a traffic sign or other traffic control device.
   (B)   Sign area and height computations. The following principles shall
control the computations of sign area and sign height:
      (1)   Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face),
shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle,
or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence
or wall when such fence or wall is clearly incidental to the display itself.

Illustration 6-4. Sign area computation for permanent building sign with no
defined sign background (e.g., channel letters)
      (2)    Computation of area of multi-faced sign. The sign area for a sign
with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all
sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed
back-to-back, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the
faces. Free standing signs may have two faces provided that the two faces are
back-to-back or at an angle no greater than 60 degrees.
      (3)   Computation of height.
         (a)   The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component
of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of:
            1.   Existing grade prior to construction; or
            2.   The newly established grade after construction, exclusion of
any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of
locating the sign.
         (b)    In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be
determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation
of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to elevation of the
nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the
principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.
When a sign is within the building setback, the calculation for the sign may
use either the base elevation or the elevation of the roadway. The computation
of sign height shall include the permitted sign and any attached changeable
copy sign or reader board and the sign structure.

Illustration 6-6: Sign height computation in cases where the normal grade
cannot reasonably be determined
   (C) Construction standards. All signs shall be constructed and maintained in
compliance with the applicable provisions of Kentucky Building Code and other
provisions of the Bardstown Code of Ordinances. All illuminated signs shall be
installed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the National Electric
Code, and all detached signs shall be so illuminated by an underground
electrical source.
   (D)   Maintenance standards. All signs shall be maintained in good
structural and aesthetic condition. Deficiencies such as chipped paint, broken
plastic, missing letters, and exposed light bulbs shall be evidence of lack of
maintenance.
   (E)   Removal of certain signs. In the event an establishment ceases
operation for a period of 30 days, the sign owner, lessee, or property owner
shall immediately remove any non-conforming signs identifying or advertising
the business or any product. This requirement shall not apply where, under the
provisions of this chapter, an existing, conforming sign may be altered to
advertise a new principal use, business, establishment, or product, and there
is evidence that a new establishment will be in operation on the premises
within 30 days. Where no such evidence exists, the sign face shall be removed
or the message shall be painted over in such a manner as to completely cover up
or hide from sight the message. Upon failure of the sign owner, lessee, or
property owner to comply with this section, the Administrator shall issue a
written notice to the owner. The notice shall state that the sign shall be
removed within ten days. If the owner fails to comply with the written notice
to remove the sign, the Administrator is hereby authorized to cause removal of
the sign. Any expense incidental to the removal of the sign shall be charged to
the owner and shall constitute a lien upon the property. For the purpose of
dealing with non-conforming signs in this section, the word "REMOVE" shall
mean:
      (1)   The sign face, along with posts, columns, or supports of free-
standing signs, shall be taken down and removed from the property;
      (2)   The sign face and supporting structures of "projection", "roof" or
"wall" signs shall be taken down and removed from the property;
      (3)   The sign face of "painted wall signs" shall be removed by painting
over the wall sign in such a manner as to completely cover up and hide from
sight the sign in question.

limitations set forth in Section 11.3.2.2.1.4 "Developments with gross floor
space more than ten thousand square feet etc." of this chapter.
Requests must be submitted as part of a CMSP to the City Sign Administrator,
for final approval by the Bardstown City Council. The CMSP will be evaluated to
determine the smallest number and size of signs to be placed at the entrances
to effectively direct the public to the campus.

   (A)   Permit required. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it
shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, install, mount, place,
apply, paint, attach, affix, expand, enlarge, move, modify, or replace any sign
or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a sign permit.
   (B)   Application and permit issuance.
      (1)   If a sign requiring a permit under the provision of this chapter is
to be erected, constructed, installed, mounted, placed, applied, painted,
attached, affixed, expanded, enlarged, moved, modified, or replaced on a
property, the property owner shall secure a sign permit prior to the
construction, placement, erection, or modification of the sign.
      (2)   No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for an existing or
proposed sign unless the sign is consistent with the requirements of this
chapter (including those protecting existing signs) in every respect and with
the sign plan in effect for that property.
      (3)   The following procedures shall govern the application for and
issuance of all sign permits under this chapter and the submission and review
of sign plans:
         (a)   Sign plan required. No permit shall be issued for an individual
sign requiring a permit until a sign plan for the property on which the sign
will be installed has been submitted to and approved by the Administrator as
conforming with this section.
         (b)   Sign plan contents. For any property on which the owner proposes
to erect one or more signs requiring a permit, the owner shall submit to the
Administrator a sign plan containing the following:
            1.   An accurate plot plan of the property, at such a scale as the
Administrator may reasonably require;
            2.   Location of buildings, structures, parking lots, driveways,
and landscaped areas of the property;
            3.   Computations of the maximum total sign area, the maximum area
for individual signs, the height of signs and the number of building and
freestanding signs allowed on the property included in the plan under this
chapter; and
            4.   An accurate indication on the plot plan of the proposed
location of each present and future sign of any type whether requiring a permit
or not.
            5.   For electronic changeable copy signs:
               a.   Specifications from the manufacturer providing the maximum
nit (or equivalent) rating of the sign;
               b.   Documentation from the manufacturer indicating that the
sign is equipped with the required automated light-sensing device; and

acknowledging the owner's agreement to abide by this chapter requiring
automatic level controls to reduce light levels at night and under cloudy or
other darkened conditions.
   (C)   Fees.
      (1)   Permit fees. No sign permit shall be issued until all applicable
fees have been paid. The fees for sign permits beginning with the adoption of
this chapter shall be $33 per sign. The sign permit fee shall be adjusted
annually based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), rounded to the nearest
percentage, as established by the Kentucky Governor's Office for Local
Development.
      (2)   Late fees. In addition to the sign permit fees, the Sign
Administrator shall also assess a $50 late fee to any applicant who erects,
places, establishes, paints, installs, creates, or in any other way initiates a
sign prior to receiving the property permit or approval from the Sign
Administrator. This fee is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalties
for violations of the regulations. Payment of this late fee will in no way
exonerate or excuse the applicant from applying in an appropriate manner and
complying with the normal requirements and standard permit fees for the
permission or applicable permit which is needed.
   (D)   Review. Within five days of submission of a sign permit application,
the Sign Administrator shall review the application for completeness. If the
application is complete, the Sign Administrator shall process the application.
If the application is incomplete, the Sign Administrator shall notify the
applicant of the deficiencies and reference the appropriate sections of this
chapter. Upon correcting the deficiencies, the Sign Administrator will process
the application.
   (E)   Issuance of permits. Within seven days of the submission of a complete
application for a sign permit, the Administrator shall either:

the applicable sign plan; or
      (2)   Deny the sign permit, if the sign that is the subject of the
application fails in any way to conform with the requirements of this chapter
and of the applicable sign plan. In case of a rejection, the Sign Administrator
shall specify in the rejection the section or sections of the chapter or
applicable plan with which the sign is inconsistent.

§ 98.13 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Continued use. A non-conforming sign may continue to be used by the
establishment occupying the structure on the site for which the sign was
originally erected, as long as no major structural support element (frame,
pole, bracing, etc.) is replaced. If a major structural support element is to
be replaced, due to voluntary action by the owner, or due to some act of God or
unforeseen circumstance, then the new sign to be erected must be in compliance
with this chapter.
   (B)   Replacement. The sign face of a non-conforming sign may be replaced as
long as no major structural element of the sign is replaced. As stated above,
if a major structural element is to be replaced, then the new sign to be
erected must be in compliance with this chapter.
   (C)   Where a change in use, occupancy, or ownership occurs which
necessitates the altering of a sign in any manner, then the altered or changed
sign shall be brought into conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   Existence of a non-conforming building sign on the premises will
prohibit issuance of further building sign permits while the non-conforming
sign exists.
   (E)   Existence of a non-conforming freestanding sign on the premises will
prohibit the issuance of further freestanding sign permits while the non-
conforming sign exists.

§ 117.04 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, net profit shall
be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) of this section.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental-
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
"passed through" these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section

payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
subsection unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for,
or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes imposed
by this chapter become or became due.
   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H) of this section, every employee
receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
117.03 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee,

by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath

determine the tax liability the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness

§ 124.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate massage
establishments in order to ensure the health, safety and general welfare of the
citizens of Bardstown, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations
relating to massage establishments.
   (B)   Findings.
      (1)   Since the operation of a massage establishment primarily involves
the physical manipulation of body parts, the actual business facility, the
manner, and the time frame in which the business is operated present important
public interest issues.
      (2)   The operation of a massage establishment requires compliance with
local and state health regulations.
      (3)   In the operation of massage establishments, equipment may be used
to perform certain manipulations on patrons. Therefore, the cleanliness and
safety of the equipment and its operation present an important public interest
issue.
      (4)   The operation of a massage establishment requires physical contact
between the employee and patrons. Hence, it is desirable to obtain a limited
amount of information regarding employees.
      (5)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism by
which to regulate massage establishments and their employees.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS Ch. 100 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Bardstown, Kentucky, hereby adopts
the following floodplain management chapter.
(Ord. 347, passed 3-10-87; Am. Ord. B2024-14, passed 12-10-24)
§ 154.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 347, passed 3-10-87; Am. Ord. B2024-14, passed 12-10-24)
§ 154.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 347, passed 3-10-87; Am. Ord. B2024-14, passed 12-10-24)   
§ 154.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.

      (3)   Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to
a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas,
as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of
the current.
      (4)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a

thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   “FLOODPROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, the FEMA form in effect at the time of certification
stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation with walls
that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all structural
components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces,
including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact forces.

regulatory floodway.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. “FREEBOARD” must be applied
not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also
to the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in §
154.23 , the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that
every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of
the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may
incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.” A facility, structure, or other

result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
miss-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The “HAZARD POTENTIAL” classification
of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a

data showing that a property was inadvertently included in a designated SFHA. A
“LOMA” amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific
property is not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).” A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.

The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first
revision.)
   “MARKET VALUE.” The property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and
seller), excluding the value of the land as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. “MARKET VALUE” of the structure can be established by
independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of
structure (actual cash value) or adjusted assessed values.

as shown on the community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either “NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929” or
“NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD) OF 1988.”
   “MITIGATION.” Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of

costs of disaster response and recovery.
   “MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW).” Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a
dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water
on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
“MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW)” may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide

conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   “ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD).” (See “BASE FLOOD.”) The flood
that has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to inundation by the

include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of Floodplain
Administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required:
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§
154.31(B) and 153.33(B);
      (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and
floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

§ 154.22 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed, authorized
and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this
chapter. The Floodplain Administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this chapter, which are consistent with its spirit and
purpose by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its
provisions. The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator
shall include, but not be limited to the following:
   (A)   Permit review. Review all development permits to ensure that:
      (1)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
      (2)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained.
Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;
      (3)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner;
      (4)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, “ADVERSELY
AFFECTS” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
   (B)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood elevation
data has not been provided in accordance with §
154.07 , the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer the provisions for flood
reduction in §§
154.30 through 154.36. Any such information shall be submitted to the City
Council for adoption.
   (C)   Notification of other agencies.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division of Water, and
any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse, and
      (2)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA); and
      (3)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
   (D)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
      (1)   Certification required by §
154.31(A) (lowest floor elevations) as shown on an accurately completed and
certified elevation certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
and substantially improved structures, in accordance with §
154.21(B);
      (2)   Certification required by §
154.31(B) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown on
an accurately completed and certified FEMA floodproofing certificate. Verify
and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the
new and substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed, in
accordance with §
154.21(B);
      (3)   Certification required by §
154.31(C) (elevated structures);
      (4)   Certification of elevation required by § 154.34(A) (subdivision
standards);
      (5)   Certification required by §
154.31(E) (floodway encroachments);
      (6)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is maintained;
      (7)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance; and
      (8)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter
as specified in §
154.99 .
   (E)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions.
      (1)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
154.23(C);
      (2)   When base flood elevation data and floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
154.07, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions for flood
reduction in §§
154.30 through
154.36;
      (3)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
154.31(B) a floodproofing certificate;
      (4)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance shall be
maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be open for
public inspection.
   (F)   Right of entry.
      (1)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the Floodplain Administrator has
reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any
premises any condition or ordinance violation which makes such building,
structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Floodplain
Administrator may enter such building, structure or premises at all reasonable
times to inspect the same or perform any duty imposed upon the Floodplain
Administrator by this chapter.
      (2)   If such structure or premises are occupied, the Floodplain
Administrator shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such
building, structure, or premises are unoccupied, he or she shall first make a
reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control
of such request entry.
      (3)   If entry is refused, the Floodplain Administrator shall have
recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
      (4)   When the Floodplain Administrator shall have first obtained a
proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no
owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any
building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is
made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the Floodplain
Administrator for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this
chapter.
   (G)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator, work
on any building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the
provisions of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in
writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her
agent, or to the person performing the work, and shall state the conditions
under which work may be resumed.
   (H)   Revocation of permits.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit or approval issued
under the provisions of this chapter in case there has been any false statement
or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or plans on
which the permit or approval was based.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit upon determination
that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition,
installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit was issued
is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of this chapter.
   (I)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the Floodplain
Administrator’s staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties, shall
not thereby render personally liable, and is hereby relieved from all personal
liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of
any act required or permitted in the discharge of his or her duties. Any suit
brought against any officer, employee, or member because of such act performed
by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this chapter shall be
defended by the Department of Law until the final termination of the
proceedings.
   (J)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A floodplain development
permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the “start of
construction” has not occurred within 180 calendar days from the date of its
issuance.

§ 154.23 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare.
The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be
met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that
must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are
designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a
variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The city hereby designates
the Board of Adjustments to hear and decide appeals and requests for variances
from the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustments shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustments
may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in the Kentucky
Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Board of
Adjustments shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
existing or proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent use;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Adjustments may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. “MINIMUM NECESSARY” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the city need not grant permission for the
applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant
proposes, but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide
relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in § 154.05 under
“public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as
defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
      (5)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §
154.23(D) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of Nelson County Clerk Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and
report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

§ 154.30 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas the following provisions are required:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
   (B)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces;
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition equipment,
and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding;
   (F)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures;
   (G)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
   (H)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters;
   (I)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
   (J)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall
meet the requirements of “new construction” as contained in §
154.05;
   (K)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered, extended, or
replaced.

154.99
§ 154.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
154.07, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
at or above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls
be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate automatic
equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall be provided in
accordance with standards of §
154.31 (C).
      (1)   In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified
in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent
grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated at or above such base flood
elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4,
Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements
for a state floodplain permit: “The applicant shall provide cross sections for
determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any
proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross
sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error
tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations
shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and
at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each
cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in
the number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to
ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require
additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those
needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.”   
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated at or above the base flood elevation.
      (4)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with §
154.31 (A) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be flood-proofed to an elevation at or above the level of the base
flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such certification along with
the design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in §
154.31(D).
      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an
elevation at or above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this requirement
must meet or exceed the standards of §
154.31(B).
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed
on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels,
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions,
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions,
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, and
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood.
         (b)   All such manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation, and
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated at or above the level of the
base flood elevation, and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
so that either the:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at or
above the base flood elevation, or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured
homes.”
         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 154.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If §
154.31(E) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and
other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions in §§
154.30 through
154.36.
   (F)   Standards for utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
         (a)   Infiltration of floodwaters into the systems, and
         (b)   Discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
      (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them, or contamination from them during flood.

FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
154.07, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
154.07.

   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
154.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely flood proofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
154.31(B).

watershed drainage map. The official watershed drainage map shall be kept in
the office of the City Civil Engineer. No final subdivision plat shall be
approved and no building permits shall be issued until and unless the
stormwater management plan has been reviewed and approved by the City Civil
Engineer. Owners of residential property within subdivisions for which final
subdivision plats have been approved prior to the date of the approval of this
chapter shall not be required to comply with this chapter. The City Civil
Engineer or his or her duly authorized designees may also require stormwater
management plans for any drainage area if adverse impacts are anticipated. A
stormwater management plan may also be required prior to any grading or
excavation which would fill, obstruct, or otherwise alter any creek, stormwater
channel, or drainage facility.
   (B)   The required stormwater management plan shall identify means for
controlling the stormwater runoff release rate from the development and
providing storage potential for the excess stormwater runoff (where required).
All computations, plans and specifications related to the implementation of
this chapter must be prepared and sealed by a professional engineer registered
in the state.
      (1)   Requirements for controls of runoff for projects under

§ 156.16 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   The city reserves the right to develop or adopt other guidance
documents to serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance
documents distributed by the city should be reviewed and considered when
preparing design and maintenance plans. Checklists, technical manuals,
administrative, or procedural matters may be modified as needed to meet the
objectives of the stormwater ordinance, provided said modifications are
consistent with the intent of this chapter and the requirements of the State.
   (B)   The following criteria, along with accompanying technical manuals and/
or guidance documents as mentioned above, shall be implemented when designing
improvements with respect to managing storm water runoff:
      (1)   Methods of determining storm water runoff discharge rate and
volume. The volume of required storm water storage and discharge rate for
drainage areas totaling 100 acres or less, shall be calculated on the basis of
the runoff from a 2, 10, 25-year frequency storm event with a 24 hour duration
for pre and post development conditions. The calculations can be made in
accordance with the instantaneous runoff factor method, the rational method,
soil conservation service (SCS) method or other methods that may be deemed
appropriate by the City Civil Engineer. The Intensity Duration Curves for
Louisville MSP may be used for Bardstown. For larger drainage systems, the SCS
hydrologic methods or the "Regional Method" of the Kentucky Transportation
Cabinet, Department of Highways shall be used to determine peak runoff rates.
   (B)   Release rate.
      (1)   All developments undertaken as outlined in that chapter shall be
done in such a way as to insure that stormwater falling on a given site shall
be absorbed or detained on site to the extent that the controlled release rate
of stormwater runoff from all developments described in §
156.15(A) shall not exceed the pre- development stormwater runoff rate, unless
it can be shown that no significant adverse downstream impacts will result from
higher rates. The rate at which stormwater runoff is delivered to a designated
stormwater storage area shall be unrestricted.
      (2)   In the event that the City Civil Engineer determines that the
natural downstream channel or storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate
the release rate provided above, then the allowable release rate shall be
reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the downstream channel or
storm sewer system.
   (C)   Development design.
      (1)   Where it can be demonstrated by the developer that a higher
stormwater release rate will not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this
chapter and where such proposed release rate will not adversely affect
properties in the downstream portion of the watershed, the City Civil Engineer
may permit such release to be used as deemed appropriate.
      (2)   Streets, blocks, lots, parks, and other public grounds shall be
located and laid out in such a manner as to minimize the velocity of overland
flow and allow maximum opportunity for infiltration of stormwater into the
ground, and to preserve and utilize existing and planned streams, channels, and
detention basins, and include, whenever possible, streams, and floodplain
within parks and other public grounds.
   (D)   Excess stormwater passage.
      (1)   An excess stormwater passage shall be provided for all stormwater
areas. Such passage shall have the capacity to convey through the proposed
development the excess stormwater. The capacity for a passage shall be such
that it will be able to transport the peak rate of run-off from a 100-year, 24-
hour return frequency storm.
      (2)    There shall be no buildings or structures constructed within
excess stormwater passage or within the elevation of the flood of record.
Parking lots, playgrounds and park areas, which shall not impair or endanger
the water holding capability of a development shall be considered compatible
uses.
      (3)   Appropriate land planning shall be undertaken to preserve the
existing natural drainage of a proposed development as part of the excess
stormwater passage.
      (4)   Open channels shall be protected from erosion by appropriate
vegetative cover, lining or other treatment and earthen channel side slopes
shall be no steeper than three to one (3:1). Open channels with lining shall
have a maximum gradient on side slopes of 67% and channel side slopes steeper
than 67% shall be designed as structural retaining walls. Refer to the Kentucky
Transportation Center’s BMP Manual for controlling erosion, sediment, and
pollutant runoff to protect channels with steep side slopes or set on a steep
gradient.
   (E)   Stormwater storage/detention areas. The increased stormwater runoff
resulting from the proposed development may be accommodated by the provision of
appropriate detention facilities including wet or dry bottom reservoirs, flat
roofs, parking lots, or streets. Storage areas shall be designed to the
satisfaction of the City Civil Engineer and if possible to provide secondary
purposes for recreation, open spaces, parking lot or other types of use that
will not be adversely affected by intermittent flooding. The following shall
govern the design of detention facilities:
      (1)   Storage volume.
         (a)   All stormwater storage areas must be designed to contain and
safely pass stormwater runoff. The combined capacity of these storage areas
shall be sufficient to contain the stormwater from the development. The
detention facility must be designed for periodic maintenance and energy
dissipators shall be provided at points necessary.
         (b)   The ponding of stormwater runoff shall not exceed a depth of one
foot on a pedestrian mall area or 1-1/2 feet maximum in parking lots. Where
these areas are used for ponding the maximum depth should occur in the most
remote and least used areas.
         (c)   The drainage and grading design shall be prepared to insure that
in a 100-year storm the depth of water run-off in any street, alley, or
pedestrian mall will not exceed the level of the first floor of any building.
The finished floor elevation shall be set two (2) feet above the 100-year flood
elevation for all new development and the minimum finished floor elevations for
homes shall be stated on the record plat.
         (d)   For wet pond storage areas when calculating the storage
capacity, only the volume available to store excess stormwater shall be
considered. Permanent water storage does not constitute control of excess storm
runoff.
      (2)   Release rate. At no time during the design storm shall the
stormwater runoff release rate exceed the allowable release rate as set forth
in division (B) of this section. Detention basins shall be fully discharged
within 36 hours of the end of the storm event.
      (3)   Release velocity. Detention facilities shall release stormwater at
a nonerosive velocity. The protected channel receiving the detention discharge
shall incorporate features to reduce velocity to nonerosive levels at the point
where such discharge enters the unprotected channel. If release is into a
subsurface conduit the energy gradient in the receiving facility shall not be
increased beyond the slope of the conduit.
      (4)   Spillway.
         (a)   Overflow for each stormwater storage area shall be provided in
the event a storm in excess of the design capacity occurs. Such overflows hall
be constructed to function without specific attention and shall become part of
the excess stormwater passage.
         (b)   Emergency spillways shall be provided to permit the safe passage
of runoff generated from a 100-year, 24-hour storm, or greater if required by
state law. The spillway dimensions shall be clearly dimensioned and protected
from erosion.
         (c)   Where rooftop storage or excess stormwater is provided, the
building shall be provided with adequate structural design to insure that roof
failure does not occur. Overflow areas shall be provided so that the weight of
stored stormwater will not exceed the structural capacity of the roof.
      (5)   Freeboard. Detention facilities shall have adequate capacity to
contain the storage volume of tributary stormwater runoff with at least one
foot of freeboard above the water surface of flow in the emergency spillway in
a 100-year, 24-hour storm or as required by state law.
      (6)   Dam. The dam slopes shall not exceed three to 1 (3:1) on the
interior of the pond. The minimum width of the top of dam shall be two (2)
feet, and the back side of the dam shall not exceed a slope of two to one (2:
1). Detention/retention pond dams built with the maximum allowable slope may be
required to utilize erosion control blankets or other means beyond seed straw
to stabilize the slopes.
      (7)   Basin slope. Dry basins shall have a minimum 1% bottom drainage
slope to allow for positive drainage during and immediately following a rain
event. For dry basins with bottom slopes less than 2%, a paved channel is
required.
   (F)   Sinkholes and subterranean water channels.
      (1)   The use of sinkholes or subterranean water channels for direct
drainage of excess stormwater shall not be permitted although they may be used
to drain a stormwater storage area. The introduction of any foreign matter or
the filling, clogging or interfering with the natural drainage capabilities of
the sinkholes shall not be permitted.
      (2)   Any person, firm or corporation proposing alterations, improvements
or other disturbances of any sinkholes or known subterranean water channel must
submit plans to the City Civil Engineer showing that said alterations,
improvements or disturbance would not interfere with the drainage capability.
Also, erosion control methods must be shown for any activities which might
create erosion or sedimentation and must be included in the plans.
      (3)   Sinkholes shall not be altered in any way which would negatively
affect the drainage capabilities of the sinkhole. Development within the 100-
year floodplain of a sinkhole shall not be permitted.

§ 156.17 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Stormwater channel location. Generally acceptable locations of
stormwater channels in the design of a subdivision may include but are not
limited to the following:
      (1)   Adjacent to roadways.
      (2)   In a depressed median of a divided roadway, provided the median is
wide enough to permit slopes of one foot drop in six feet horizontal or
flatter.
      (3)   Centered on lot lines or entirely within the rear yards of a single
row of lots or parcels.
      (4)   In each of the foregoing cases, a drainage easement with sufficient
width to facilitate maintenance and design flow shall be provided and shown on
the plat.
   (B)   Storm sewer outfall. The storm sewer outfall shall be designed to
provide adequate protection against downstream erosion and scouring.
   (C)   Lot lines. Whenever the plans call for the passage and/or storage of
stormwater runoff along lot lines, the grading of all such lots shall be
prescribed and established for the passage and/or storage of waters, and no
structure or vegetation which would obstruct the flow of stormwater shall be
allowed, nor shall any change be made to the prescribed grades and contours of
the specified stormwater channels.
   (D)   Manholes. All utility sewer manholes constructed in an area designed
for the storage or passage of stormwater, shall be provided with either a
watertight manhole cover or be constructed with a rim elevation of a minimum of
one foot above the high water elevation of the design storm.
   (E)   Easements. Permanent easements for the detention and conveyance of
stormwater, including easements of access to structures and facilities, shall
be dedicated to the city.
   (F)   Drainage obstruction. The keeping or disposal of grass clippings,
trash, debris, obstructions or unwanted materials into the storm sewers or
within or along stormwater channels or in adjacent flood plain areas which may
wash into sewers and channels, is prohibited.
   (G)   Maintenance. Required maintenance for detention basins or other
structures shall be permanently provided by the developer with responsibility
becoming that of the private landowner after complete development, subject to
inspection by the City Civil Engineer or duly authorized representative. Every
detention basin or structure shall be legally defined on both deed and plat and
the maintenance entity shall be specified. Refer to §
156.31 Maintenance Requirements.

§ 156.18 POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   Purpose. Land development projects and associated increases in
impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and
sediment transport and deposition; Stormwater runoff contributes to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the
regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. The purpose of this
chapter is to establish minimum post stormwater management requirements and
controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of
the public residing in watersheds within the City of Bardstown. The goal is to
maintain or improve the quality of all streams within the Municipal Separate
Storm Sewer System (MS4) boundaries and corporate limits, to meet their
designated use. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
      (1)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation and streambank erosion and maintain the
integrity of stream channels;
      (2)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by
stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
      (3)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and
      (4)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
   (B)   General.
      (1)   (a)   Depositing of material in public or private systems. It shall
be unlawful for any person to do, or fail to do when required, the following:
anything that covers, alters, redirects, obstructs, impairs or encroaches in a
drainage system, whether it be in the public right-of-way, or within a drainage
easement on private property. This includes the construction of any building,
shed, fence, pool, landscaping berm, trees, or depositing of any yard debris,
fill material, pollutants, sewage, solid waste, dumping of concrete, etc. or
excavate without a permit. Actions that can cause flooding, ponding, excess
erosion or sedimentation that result in property damage, or otherwise cause a
health or safety risk to the public are in violation of the rules and
regulations established in this section. Such areas that this applies are as
follows:
            1.   Right-of-way ditches;
            2.   Street curb and gutter;
            3.   Drainage swales;
            4.   Open ditches;
            5.   Stormwater inlets, manholes, and catch basins;
            6.   Stormwater management facilities such as detention ponds and
water quality BMPs;
            7.   Natural streams, creeks, rivers, ponds, lakes, and the like.
         (b)   See also the ordinance for streets, curbs and sidewalks, §
96.15 for additional regulations and restrictions on obstructing natural or
constructed drainage facilities.
      (2)   Grading/regrading private property. It shall be unlawful for any
person to, or direct another person to, grade or regrade any private property
in such a manner as to obstruct, divert, or impede the natural flow of
stormwater across said person’s property or adjoining properties. Within
residential neighborhoods, a drainage swale within the designated general
utility easement along the side and rear property lines should be utilized when
applicable to promote the positive drainage of stormwater runoff without
adversely impacting adjoining properties.
      (3)   Construction of private storm sewer systems. All private storm
sewer systems shall be in place, operational, and certified by a licensed
professional engineer prior to receiving certificate of occupancy. It shall be
unlawful for any person to refuse to construct any part of a private storm
sewer system that has been approved and permitted as part of a development or
site plan, without approval in advance by the City Civil Engineer. Any changes
to the approved and permitted plans must be resubmitted for review.
   (C)   Post-construction stormwater management plan (PC-SWMP).
      (1)   A post-construction stormwater management plan (PC-SWMP) shall be
submitted for all subdivisions that discharge to MS4 high quality waters. This
includes residential, commercial, and industrial developments. The PC-SWMP is
required for all sites one acre and larger in size, and all sites part of a
greater common development.
      (2)   The city reserves the right to develop or adopt other guidance
documents to serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance
documents distributed by the city should be reviewed and considered when
preparing the PC- SWMP. These documents may be applied as standards by which
designs are to be prepared and controls implemented.
      (3)   The city shall have the authority to implement this chapter by
appropriate regulations, guidance or other related materials. In this regard,
technical, administrative, or procedural matters may be modified as needed to
meet the objectives herein.
(Ord. B2011-19, passed 9-27-11) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.19 POST-CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   The city reserves the right to develop or adopt guidance documents to
serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance documents
distributed by the city should be reviewed and considered when preparing the
post-construction SWMP. Technical, administrative, or procedural matters may be
modified as needed to meet the objectives defined in this chapter so long as
they are not contrary or beyond the intent of the objectives listed above. Such
documents given authority by this chapter include best management practice
(BMP) manuals, design regulations and requirements, checklists that address
submittals, plan review, and inspections, certifications, stormwater manuals,
and operation and maintenance manuals. The documents may be updated
periodically to reflect the most current and effective design and construction
practices and be made available to the public. Failure to update the manual
does not relieve the applicant from complying with this chapter.
   (B)   Post-construction stormwater BMPs shall be designed in accordance with
the most current manual or requirements to achieve the following performance
standards:
      (1)   Water quality of stormwater produced from the 80th percentile rain
event shall be addressed with best management measures that are built and
maintained to treat, filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen, evapo-transpire,
harvest and reuse stormwater runoff, or otherwise manage the runoff for all new
and redeveloped sites. (The 80% rain event is based on past rainfall data and
will continually change with future rain events, however, it is not anticipated
to vary drastically from one year to another).
      (2)   BMPs shall be designed to remove pollutants and reduce runoff
volume. The designated use and any existing in-stream use of the stream being
discharged to shall be protected. Some land uses produce higher concentrations
of certain pollutants such as hydrocarbons or heavy metals, than those normally
found in urban areas. These areas will be reviewed for effective removal of the
particular pollutant which they discharge. Effective removal will be that which
existed prior to development. Examples of land uses that produce higher levels
of pollutants are:
         (a)   Gas/fueling Stations;
         (b)   Restaurant dumpster areas;
         (c)   Vehicle repair facilities;
         (d)   Vehicle washing/steam cleaning facilities;
         (e)   Auto recycling facilities;
         (f)   Outdoor material storage areas;
         (g)   Loading and transfer areas;
         (h)   Landfills; and
         (i)   Industrial sites.
      (3)   BMPs shall reduce or buffer increases in stormwater runoff
temperature caused by contact with impervious surfaces as well as minimize
increases in stormwater runoff volume and flow rate caused by increases in
impervious surfaces.
      (4)   The PC-SWMP shall include provisions for buffer zones. A buffer
zone shall be defined as:
         (a)   Area contained within a boundary established by the FEMA
floodplain boundary; or
         (b)   Where a floodplain is not defined or calculated, the buffer will
be 25 feet on each side from the top of waterway bank as defined by geomorphic
shape (not by current water surface elevation).
            1.   Buffers shall be provided to all blue-line streams as shown on
the USGS map.
            2.   Buffer areas and floodplain may be used for stormwater quality
devices provided erosion prevention, sediment control, cut-fill practices are
addressed appropriately as determined by the city to meet this chapter.
            3.   Exemptions can be granted to buffers so long as erosion and
sediment control, water quality are addressed. Exemptions for building in the
buffer area shall be granted for:
               a.   Roads and utilities crossing waterways.
               b.   Pedestrian trails and walkways adjacent to waterways.
               c.   Other exemptions may be made at the discretion of the City
Civil Engineer.
      (5)   (a)   Redevelopment not previously addressing water quantity or
quality control shall reduce the discharge from their site according to the
formula below:
   Q(redeveloped) = Q(existing) + Q(undeveloped)
            2
      Q(redeveloped) =   maximum discharge rate for the re-development
      Q(existing) =   current discharge rate of the developed parcel
      Q(undeveloped) =   discharge rate of the parcel prior to any development
         (b)   The reduction of allowable flow rate for redeveloped areas shall
not exceed more than 30% of the existing developed flow rate. These flow rates
are based on redevelopment sites that disturb one acre or more.
      (6)   The City of Bardstown reserves the right to require additional
treatment criteria or objectives for specific pollutant(s) as necessary to meet
overall stormwater quality management program objectives or directives under a
watershed improvement or Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program as
administered by the USEPA and/or the Kentucky Division of Water.
      (7)   For projects that cannot meet the above quality criteria, they may
choose either of the following options:
         (a)   Off-site mitigation option: entails infiltration/
evapotranspiration/reuse measures that may be implemented at another location
within the same watershed as the original project approved by the city. The
city shall identify priority areas within the watershed in which mitigation
projects can be completed.
         (b)   Payment-in-lieu option: allows the owner of a project that falls
within the quality criteria, to make a payment to the city in lieu of
implementing post-construction BMPs. The city will apply the in-lieu funds to a
public stormwater project. The fee shall be used for acquisition, design,
construction, or maintenance of one or more such facilities in the same
watershed in which the development is located.
      (8)   Permanent easements for all stormwater drainage ways, quality and
quantity facilities shall be dedicated to the city and recorded in the Nelson
County Clerk’s Office. There shall also be dedicated easements for access to
all stormwater management facilities.

§ 156.31 MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.
   (A)   General. Individual property owners, whether residential or
commercial, shall be responsible for the general and overall maintenance of the
drainage easements and the street right-of-way ditch. Such maintenance includes
mowing, keeping the drainway free of leaves and debris, and following the
guidelines within this chapter. Property owners shall install and maintain
their permitted entrance pipe. The pipe shall be kept free of debris, and
excess sediment that builds up over time, which constricts the flow of the
street runoff. No one shall "fill-in" the right-of-way ditch or any drainage
way without first obtaining an land disturbance permit. All proposed piping of
ditches shall be appropriately sized and may be required to have a catch basin
to allow for intake of surface water. The property owner shall ensure that
adequate vegetation remains in the drainway and provide a hardened surface
where applicable to prevent erosion.
   (B)   Stormwater maintenance agreement. A stormwater maintenance agreement,
approved by the City Civil Engineer, assuring perpetual maintenance of storm
water management improvements, including post-construction BMPs, shall be
executed by the applicants to the City of Bardstown. The agreement shall be
recorded among the deed records in the Nelson County Clerk’s office upon final
plan approval. The agreement shall be a covenant running with the land and
shall be binding on the landowner, its administrators, executers, heirs,
assigns and any other successors of interest, including any homeowners
association. A copy of an appropriate maintenance agreement can be obtained
from the City Engineering Department.
      (1)   Operation and maintenance of all stormwater quality and quantity
devices, BMPs, and drainage ways shall be the responsibility of the property
owner. Operation and maintenance shall be required sufficient to maintain
proper function and water quality at the discharge point.
      (2)   (a)   Routine inspections are the responsibility of property owner
to ensure the stormwater facilities/BMPs are operating and functioning as
designed and that required maintenance activities have occurred. The property
owner must submit an inspection report annually to the city. The report shall
include any action taken, who took it, when the action was done, how it was
done, and any problems encountered or follow-up actions recommended.
Maintenance problems shall be inspected monthly or more frequently as necessary
to assure safe and proper functioning of the facilities.
         (b)   Example post-construction stormwater facility/BMP maintenance
inspection checklists are available at the Office of the City Civil Engineer.
      (3)   The city and its agents shall have the right of entry to inspect,
observe, test or perform any other related activity to the operation,
maintenance, and function of the stormwater infrastructure. The city has the
right to perform inspections and emergency maintenance on the facilities;
however, it is not the city’s obligation to maintain the stormwater quality/
quantity facility.

§ 156.32 FEES AND SECURITY.
   (A)   Permits.
      (1)   Land disturbance permit. A Land Disturbance Permit must be obtained
from the Office of the City Engineer when land disturbance activities are to be
performed for sites as defined per the City Engineering Department's Fee
Schedule for Encroachment Work and Land Disturbance Activities, hereafter
referred to as "Fee Schedule."
      (2)   Encroachment permit. An encroachment permit must be obtained from
the Office of the City Engineer when any work is to be performed in the city
right-of-way. The permit shall cover only one specified encroachment activity.
Such right-of-way encroachments include permanent or temporary entrances,
installation or repair of sidewalks, curb cuts, ditch work, or any other
activities in the public right-of-way that may impact proper drainage or damage
public infrastructure. A drawing, sketch, and/or description of the work shall
be provided. All work must be done in accordance with all city ordinances,
regulations, and standards. Refer to Chapter 96: Streets, Curbs, and Sidewalks
for more information. Future maintenance of the encroachment is the
responsibility of the permit holder.
      (3)   Time frame. The permit holder shall have 12 months (one year) from
date of permit issuance to construct the entrance, encroachments, and/or land
disturbing activities in accordance with the permit. Failure to complete the
work properly within this one-year time frame shall be reasons for forfeiture
of the bond. If the work is not completed properly within the one-year time
frame, no further permits will be issued to the permit holder until the
property comes into compliance with this ordinance. Extensions may be approved
by the City Engineer or designee.
      (4)   Bonds. A minimum performance bond shall accompany the submittal of
each permit as required. Bond values shall be no less than $500 as described in
the fee schedule and shall be an amount sufficient enough to cover the cost of
the improvements as approved by the City Engineer. Such items to be bonded may
include, but are not limited to, erosion control measures and their
maintenance, construction of stormwater facilities as described in this
chapter, all encroachment work including entrances, sidewalks, curb cuts,
utility crossings, etc. The bond is fully refundable provided all improvements
are constructed as specified on the permit and the approved improvement plans.
The design engineer shall submit certifications for detention ponds and other
control facilities, as required, to the Office of the City Engineer. A
representative from the city shall inspect the completed work to ensure all
areas within the public right-of-way and stormwater facilities have vegetation
established and are functioning as designed before releasing the bond.
      (5)   Permit fees. All land disturbance and encroachment permits shall
have a permit fee to cover administrative and inspection costs which shall be
not less than $50 and no more than $5,000. All permit fees are due at the time
of application and shall be assessed according to the fee schedule.
      (6)   Late fee. A late fee shall be assessed to permits when construction
activities begin prior to the land disturbance permit being issued. The late
fee shall be equal and in addition to the original permit fee (i.e. late fee =
original permit fee; revised permit fee = late fee + original permit fee).
   (B)   Review fees. Projects that must go through the plan review process
shall be charged a review fee per the fee schedule. Review fees shall be not
less than $50 and no more than $5,000. All review fees are due at the time of
plan submittal. No permits shall be issued until all review fees have been
paid.
      (1)   For new residential, commercial, and industrial developments that
require a SWPPP and/or SWMP per this section, review fees shall be assessed
according to the fee schedule.
      (2)   Review of development plans where infrastructure will be taken over
by the city and become part of the public road and/or utility systems (i.e.
water, sewer, street, etc.), additional plan review fees shall be assessed
according to the fee schedule.
      (3)   Resubmittal fee. Incomplete plans and/or submittal packages will
not be reviewed until all required documents have been received by the city.
Plans and/or documents of the submittal package requiring major revisions may
be assessed a resubmittal fee equal to one half the original review fee.
Revisions that take place after approval and issuance of the land disturbance
permit may be assessed the same resubmittal fee.
   (C)   Recording fees. For sites that require documents to be recorded by the
Nelson County Clerk's office, recording fees will be charged per the Nelson
County Clerk's Fee Schedule for Land Records. Such documents may include, but
are not limited to, deed of easements, maintenance agreements, subdivision
agreements, etc. The city will handle recording on behalf of the permittee and
will collect fees at the time of plan submittal.
   (D)   Establishment of storm water management fund.
      (1)   The storm water management program is established and the storm
water system is provided to protect the waterways and land in the city by
managing flooding and to benefit the natural environment. The costs of
designing, developing, improving, operating, maintaining, and monitoring the
storm water system required in the city should, therefore, be allocated, to the
extent as practicable, to all property owners. In order to provide revenue to
fund those costs and to fairly allocate those costs, a Storm Water Management
Fund ("the Fund") is established.
      (2)   All revenues collected from the storm water management fee from
grants, permit fees, and other charges collected under the Storm Water
Management Program, shall be deposited to the Fund. The City Council may make
additional appropriations to the Fund. All disbursements from the Fund shall be
for the purposes of the Fund as set forth in division (E).
   (E)   Purposes of the Fund. The Fund shall be used for the following
purposes:
      (1)   The acquisition by gift, purchase, or condemnation of real and
personal property, and interests therein, necessary to construct, operate, and
maintain storm water management facilities.
      (2)   All costs of administration and implementation of the Storm Water
Management Program, including the establishment of reasonable operating and
capital reserves to meet unanticipated or emergency storm water management
requirements.
      (3)   Engineering and design, debt service and related financing
expenses, construction costs for new facilities, amid enlargement or
improvement of existing facilities.
      (4)   Operation and maintenance of the storm water system.
      (5)   Monitoring, surveillance, and inspection of storm water control
devices.

§ 156.46 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Standards. Variances from these standards, provisions, and
specifications may be granted when it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the City Council that, owing to special conditions, a strict adherence to the
provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship and that the
spirit and intent of the chapter will be observed.   
(B)   Procedure. A written request for variance shall be filed by the owner,
seeking to develop or change the use of his property, or his agent with the
City Civil Engineer and shall state specifically what variance is sought and
the public’s interest in granting the variance. The applicant must specify
hardships to result in following the prescribed regulations. The City Civil
Engineer must then examine and decide the validity of the proposed hardships.
This request is then submitted to the City Council by the City Civil Engineer
along with a recommendation about granting the variance.    
      (1)   The variance will be granted only upon showing that there is good
and sufficient cause and that the failure to grant a variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant. Financial hardship to the property
owners not constitute operator appropriate grounds for a variance under this
chapter.   
      (2)   A record of all variance actions shall be maintained by the
Engineering Department including the justification for issuance.
      (3)   Variances may be considered for the reconstruction, abilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the State Inventory of Historic Places.

§ 156.50 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   The City Civil Engineering Department in conjunction with Bardstown Public
Works and Code Enforcement shall be responsible for the enforcement of this
chapter. Duly authorized representatives have the authority to issue notices of
violation, stop work orders, and levy fines. Enforcement actions shall be
served to the property owner as listed on the permit or most current property
owner as held by the PVA office.
   (A)   Notice of deficiency (NOD). If any site violates the conditions of
this chapter when inspected by the city’s authorized representative, a NOD
shall be issued to the violator. The NOD may be verbal or written to either NOI
holder or the property owner. The violator shall be given seven (7) calendar
days, or as directed by the City Civil Engineer or designee, to correct the
deficiency per the details as specified in the NOD.
   (B)   Notice of violation (NOV). A written NOV shall be issued to either the
holder of the NOI or the owner(s) of the site, when previously sited, does not
comply with the terms of the NOD within the time period given. The violator
shall be given five (5) calendar days to correct the deficiency per the details
as specified in the NOV. The city’s authorized representative has the right to
modify the timeframe for corrections based on his/her judgment, due to project
conditions.
   (C)   Stop work order (SWO). A stop work order shall be issued to anyone
previously cited with an NOV that does not comply with the terms or the
violation within the time frame given. All work on the site shall stop except
for activities necessary to correct the violation. The violator shall be given
seven (7) days, or as directed, to correct the deficiency per the details of
stop work order. Upon completion of remediated actions as inspected the city,
then the stop work order shall be rescinded, and work can continue on the site.
      (1)   If the holder of the NOI or property owner does not comply with the
stop work order conditions within the time period specified the violator will
be penalized as specified in §
156.99 Penalty. The city may also perform the remedial work and make claim
against the permit holder to recover its expenses and costs.
      (2)   For violations where no permit has been issued, the Office of the
City Civil Engineer will notify the property owner and cooperate for resolution
prior to enforcement. Should the owner not cease the land disturbing activities
or demonstrate a history of non-compliance of the same nature, the City Civil
Engineer may request the City Attorney to seek injunctive relief as described
in §
156.99 Penalty.
      (3)   The city may deny the issuance of any permits for any project or
property to an applicant when it determines that the applicant is not in
compliance with the provisions of any land disturbance permit or approved
stormwater management or erosion and sediment control plan, or has failed to
comply with any other provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   The City Civil Engineering Department is authorized to require
immediate abatement of any violation of this chapter that constitutes an
immediate threat to the health, safety, or well-being of the public. If any
violation is not abated immediately, the city is authorized to enter onto
private or public property and to take any and all measures required to
remediate the violation. Any expense related to such remediation undertaken by
the city shall be fully reimbursed by the property owner and/or responsible
party. The cost of remediation plus any administrative and attorney fees shall
be billed to the owner. Failure to reimburse the city within thirty (30) days
will result in a lien being placed on the property.
   (D)   Appeals. A permit holder or property owner may appeal an enforcements
action to the City Council within 15 days of the date of notification. The
appeal shall be made in writing to the Mayor. The Mayor may then allot time at
a regular council meeting or call a special meeting where the owner or permit
holder shall be given an opportunity to be heard and he may call witnesses and
present evidence on his behalf. After such meeting, if the City Council
concludes that the issuance of additional correction notices would be futile,
any bonds or cash deposits posted with the city shall be forfeited, whereupon
said security shall be used for completion of the storm water management plan
as approved.
   (E)   Post-construction stormwater management facilities/BMPs.
      (1)   When deficiencies are noted upon inspection by the city, the city
shall provide the property owner copies of the inspection report with findings
and evaluations. The owner then has thirty (30) days to get the stormwater
facilities in working order as per its original design function.
      (2)   In the event the property owner neglects to make repairs upon
notification, and/or fails to maintain the stormwater management facilities in
good working condition acceptable to the city, the city may enter upon the
property and take whatever steps it deems necessary to maintain said stormwater
management/BMP facilities and to charge the costs of the repairs to the
landowner, its successors and assigns. This provision shall not be construed to
allow the City of Bardstown to erect any structure of a permanent nature on the
property of the landowner, outside of an easement for stormwater management/BMP
facilities. It is expressly understood and agreed that the city is under no
obligation to maintain or repair the facilities.
      (3)   In the event the city performs work of any nature or expends any
funds in performance of the work for labor, use of equipment supplies,
materials, and the like on account of the landowner, its successors and
assigns, the landowner shall reimburse the city upon demand, within thirty (30)
days of receipt thereof for all costs incurred by the city.

§ 157.01 INTRODUCTION.
   The following design standards are intended to be used as a design aid by
developers proposing commercial establishments and as an evaluation tool by the
Development Review Board and Planning Commission in their review processes.
These guidelines apply to all projects, which are processed according to the
criteria for proposed development plans and to all projects for commercial
establishments. These guidelines are to be used in conjunction with the Nelson
County 2020: A Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Regulations for All of Nelson County,
and Subdivision Regulations for All of Nelson County.
(Ord.795, passed 1-27-04)
§ 157.02 BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION.
   (A)   These standards are intended to ensure that commercial building
development is compatible with its surrounding area and contributes to the
unique community character of the county. The intent is to encourage a more
human-scale development that residents of the city/county will be able to
identify. The resulting scale of commercial buildings will ensure a greater
likelihood for reuse of structures by subsequent tenants.
   (B)   It is well-recognized in the planning and development literature that
careful attention to attractive and citizen-friendly urban design is in the
economic interests of a municipality, its citizens, and business owners.
Attractive and integrated urban design features tend to improve a town’s image,
raise overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, and
improve the quality of life. Research and experience has demonstrated that
there is a positive return on investment for design features for both
government, private industry, and property owners. For example, the money a
town spends on landscaped roadway medians, sidewalks, and street trees is
likely to be amply returned in the form of increased tax revenue resulting from
the overall increase in property values that accompanies attractive and
desirable urban areas.
   (C)   In towns and cities across the country, including the city/county,
there is a growing realization that incompatibilities between land uses are
very often a function of design and development impacts rather than of
differences in their land uses. The focus in current use-based development
regulation is to require strict separation and substantial buffers between
different land uses, regardless of design or site impacts. However, with
appropriate and compatible urban design it could be entirely reasonable for
commercial, office, and residential uses to be placed literally side-by-side,
with little need for strict separation and buffering. This realization has in
part led to the emergence of the traditional neighborhood development movement
and has prompted numerous municipalities to shift from strict use-based
regulation of development to design-based and impact-based regulation which is
much more flexible. This Commercial Establishment Design Standards chapter is a
first step towards such design- and impact-based guidance of development in the
city/county.
   (D)   State and National Trend Towards Pedestrian-Friendly Design
Guidelines.
      (1)   Throughout the state and country, communities are reevaluating
their standards for commercial development and demanding that national and
regional chains integrate local custom and character into their site and
building designs. This trend has surfaced as the commercial industry has
continued its shift towards generating national commercial chains (often
through corporate mergers), and as various regional chains have expanded into
new markets. Because these larger companies have standardized their designs to
mass-market products at a lower cost, there is little variation in building and
site design from coast to coast. This phenomenon has begun to concern citizens
as they see their communities become "normalized" and molded into patterns
similar to every other town and city in America.
      (2)   This loss of a sense of uniqueness and place, in addition to the
continued focus on designs which cater solely to the automobile, has led many
communities to implement stronger local design requirements in order to
recapture individual town character and to reclaim the realm of the pedestrian.
Many of these communities’ design guidelines have sought to balance the
mobility needs of residents with respect to a range of transportation modes
(i.e., by automobile, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle modes). Municipalities
locally and across the country have adopted design guidelines that encourage
the integration of common design themes which complement those existing in the
community, reduce building setbacks, and orient buildings onto streets and
public spaces to achieve a more human-scale and pedestrian-friendly
environment.
      (3)   Lexington and Georgetown, Kentucky, Gresham, Oregon, Fort Collins,
Colorado, Bellevue, Washington, and Mashpee, Massachusetts, are examples of
municipalities from across the state and country that have successfully adopted
design standards for local development which are intended to preserve local
character and promote pedestrian-friendly, human-scale development. Examples of
successful commercial projects developed under these standards are given below:
         (a)   Mashpee Commons is a commercial center in Mashpee,
Massachusetts. It offers a good example of a center that was redeveloped under
new municipal design guidelines. It is also representative of the activity
center concept described throughout the Nelson County 2020: A Comprehensive
Plan Land Use Plan. The Mashpee Commons renovation consisted of reorienting
shops from a strip configuration to one oriented towards the streets, and which
created public spaces such as plazas and porticos, as well as providing a mix
of shops that include larger national chains and local operators. Mixing
office, institutional, and public spaces has brought more people to the center,
and it has become a focal point for the community. The gross leasable area on
the site’s 25 acres doubled, and average annual rents have nearly doubled as
well. Expansion of this center was conducted in a fully saturated commercial
market.
         (b)   In Gresham, Oregon, no building footprints larger than 70,000
square feet are allowed in the Neighborhood Civic District. Thus, "big box"
retailers are required to design buildings having smaller footprints, and/or
build upward. Guidelines requiring pedestrian-oriented commercial centers have
been in place for eight months. A Walgreen’s Drugstore site has been approved
for development based upon their conformance with these guidelines. Some of the
town’s other design guidelines include restrictions against blank walls along
streets, having buildings oriented and built to street fronts, and having
parking distributed to the sides and rear of sites. Retailers continue to seek
approval of development plans in Gresham, knowing that they will have to work
within local guidelines. The pace of development and local economic growth has
not slowed under these guidelines.
         (c)   The City of Bellevue, Washington, requires that all new
development and redevelopment of commercial sites abide by its pedestrian-
oriented design guidelines, which have been in place for six years. Bellevue
Square was developed under these standards, and has proven to be immensely
successful. The Square was converted from an old open-air mall to a two-story
enclosed structure. The mall fronts two streets at a corner and is sited on 35
acres. Parking is distributed around the building and in structured lots. Major
anchor tenants with sidewalk entrances are located there, including JC Penney,
which had historically not located in non-conventional mall settings. Other
stores within the Square include high-end retailers like Nordstroms, Ann
Taylor, and Bally.
      (4)   Not only do design guidelines that seek to foster development of
natural amenities and architecturally pleasing features at a human scale
provide public benefits, but in most instances, the rate of return for the
developer is dramatically higher. This trend has been recorded through surveys
conducted by the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and documented in its publication,
Value by Design. These studies have documented that added financial benefits
are routinely reaped in both commercial and residential developments where
extra design features are incorporated. Results of other surveys conducted for
ULI have concluded that home buyers value open space, pedestrian/bicycle paths,
community control over design, and small clusters of neighborhood-oriented
retail located near residences.
      (5)   Evidence shows that implementation of design standards that focus
development in a human-scale, pedestrian-friendly manner are profitable both
emotionally and financially. While such design standards are being adopted more
and more throughout the country, retailers are altering their design models in
order to compete in these towns’ large and growing markets. Areas that are
viewed as desirable commercial markets are obviously in a sound position to
implement local design guidelines. The city/county is just such a market.
Retailers know that there is likely to be untapped consumer demand in the city/
county as it grows, making Bardstown-Nelson County an extremely attractive
commercial development market.
      (6)   This chapter does not seek to create a set of rigid standards.
Instead, the plan ordinance provides a flexible alternative to conventional
shopping center development, designed to answer residents’ wishes for
commercial and residential development that gives greater consideration to
pedestrian access, is more accessible to neighborhoods, and builds an even more
attractive town environment. The Nelson County 2020: A Comprehensive Plan
suggests the following:
         "Page 33. Interview and Workshop Findings.
         4.   Maintain Quality of Community. The issue of maintaining the
quality of life in Nelson County was identified as an issue that should be a
top priority. The attractiveness of Nelson County was recognized as a major
factor for the amount of growth in the County recently. The prevalent attitude
expressed was that growth and new development should respect, maintain or
improve the quality of life in Nelson County, and not detract from it. Several
factors were identified as contributing to or determining the quality of life
in the community. Preserving the historic appearance and atmosphere of Nelson
County is a major concern, as is the preservation of strong downtown areas (in
New Haven and Bloomfield as well as Bardstown). Similarly, it is important that
the rural character and atmosphere be maintained throughout the County in order
to sustain the quality of life that has attracted and retained residents and
industry to Nelson County.
   Page 34. Visions for the Future.
      •   Strong rural character
      •   Small town atmosphere
      •   Adequate roads to serve demands
      •   Quality entryways/gateways to each Community
      •   Maintenance of the historic character
      •   Increased tourism industry
   Page 35. Cornerstone Issues - Objectives
      Community Identity - Maintain the sense of place and small town
atmosphere of each community by recognizing the contributions of historic
structures, small town character, public institutions, central business
districts and the appearance and land use composition of existing neighborhoods
and by evaluating the impact that future development will have on community
identity.
      Quality of Life - Support growth and development that enhances the
overall quality of life of Nelson County through the encouragement of quality
schools and education, a strong economic mixture and diversity in industry,
high quality and planned services and utilities, a responsive local government,
a mixture of housing types, an aesthetically pleasing built environment, and a
safe, healthy environment.
   Page 36. General Development Policies.
   •   Future non-residential growth should be guided to locate within existing
Commercial/Industrial Centers in Urban Area, Central Business District.
   •   Careful impact assessment of proposed industrial establishments should
be conducted to determine potential impacts on environmental, infrastructure
and community conditions.
   Page 37. General Development Policies.
   •   Evaluate future large scale development proposals on the basis of the
impact on the existing and future public services and infrastructure, requiring
mitigation techniques where feasible. The public services impact evaluation
should include at a minimum an assessment of impact on roads, water treatment
and distribution capabilities, sewer treatment and distribution capabilities,
schools, electric, police and fire services and a statement of the availability
of adequate service levels for each type of service.
   •   Limit the impact of future and existing development on the rural
character of Nelson County by establishing criteria and development standards
to address issues associated with development, such as noise, light, and storm
water runoff impacts.
   Pages 50-51. Commercial Retail Centers.
   1.   The Eastern Bardstown Gateway refers to the largely undeveloped land
located at and surrounding the Bluegrass Parkway exit at US 150, including the
land adjacent to SR 245 in this area. The development of this area will be
important to Bardstown and to Nelson County, because this area is a gateway to
Bardstown and many visitors utilize this route. The Land Use Plan for the Urban
Community Area recommends that the Eastern Gateway develop as a planned
commercial park - combining retail, service and office uses. The construction
and layout of this area should be coordinated to ensure a compatible design
theme is established for the entire area. It is recommended that a more
detailed conceptual plan for the land uses in this area be developed with the
input of the property owners, Nelson County officials, City of Bardstown
officials and the Joint Planning Commission. The development of a Conceptual
Plan for the Eastern Gateway, which is primarily zoned Light Industrial Park
(LIP) that includes the participation of the parties described above, could
result in a well-defined vision for the future development of this area. Such a
conceptual plan should address land use composition (including uses and
densities), site design (parking, surface area and open space ratios),
circulation and access, and design/appearance (internal circulation,
landscaping and signage).
   2.   The South Bardstown Gateway isolated on US 31E surrounding the Blue
Grass Parkway interchange and is also a primary entry into the City of
Bardstown. The current zoning regulations should be amended to include more
detailed standards and evaluation criteria for such issues as traffic impact,
lighting control, noise impacts, screening and buffering and access location
for future uses in this area.
   3.   The US 31 E/SR 245 Corridor Area is the primary retail center for
Bardstown and for Nelson County. Retail commercial development is concentrated
on the western side of the US 31 E/SR 245 intersection. Traffic congestion,
access management and future development designs are primary concerns for the
future in this area. This Commercial Center is recommended to remain the
designated location for regional retail commercial uses. The Land Use Group Map
indicates that this Commercial Center should expand west along the south side
of SR 245 to the intersection of Withrow Court and SR 245. Proposed
transportation improvements in this area should improve traffic congestion. For
example, the State has included widening at SR 245 to five lanes from Templin
Avenue east to US 62 in its six year road budget plan. This should provide
needed transportation capacity, particularly during noon and evening peak hour
traffic. Also, the Transportation Plan (Chapter 6) recommends that the City
construct an extension of Withrow Court. While this proposed road is not
intended to be a bypass, it will remove local traffic that currently must use
US 31 E and SR 245.
      The City/County should undertake a more detailed traffic and access study
for this area. Future access locations, potential frontage roads, traffic
signal timing and more detailed land use analysis should be conducted as part
of such a study. This area would also benefit from the proposed zoning
regulation amendments described for the South Bardstown Gateway. The use of
Planned Unit Developments should also be encouraged in this Commercial Center
to provide greater design flexibility and control.

Guidelines for Large Establishments)
      (2)   Parking layout. No more than 60% of the off-street parking area for
the lot, tract or area of land devoted to the commercial establishment shall be
located between the front facade of the large commercial establishment and the
abutting streets (the "front parking area"). Parking spaces in the front
parking area shall be counted to include all parking spaces within the
boundaries of the front parking area. Variances of up to 80% may be granted by
the Development Review Board if the front parking area is screened from view by
out lot or out parcel development (such as restaurants, banks, and the like)
and additional tree plantings and/or berms as approved by the Development
Review Board. Landscaping within the parking area may be required for a large-
scale commercial development.
   (C)   Buffering and streetscape.
      (1)   Buffering. The project shall provide visual and noise buffers where
the site is adjacent to a residential use or residentially zoned property and/
or an agricultural use or agriculturally zoned property that the Comprehensive
Plan does not anticipate as commercial use in a Land Use Group Map adjacent to
the site. This can be accomplished by providing a minimum building setback from
a residential use or residentially zoned property that is adjacent to the site,
this area must remain as green space. Table 1 provides required minimum
building setbacks. (Setbacks listed in Table 1 below). An eight foot high or
higher, masonry screen wall and at least a 20-foot wide landscape buffer shall
be provided adjacent to the site property line. The landscape buffer shall be
placed on the inside and or outside of the screen wall and shall include, in
addition to shrubs and groundcover, canopy trees at 20- to 30-foot intervals
depending on the separation needed for the tree canopies to touch at maturity
to form a noise, light, and visual screen above the screen wall. Berms may be
used as an alternative buffer if approved by the Development Review Board. No
other uses, such as but not limited to parking or storage, are permitted within
the landscape buffer area.
      (2)   Streetscape. A streetscape landscape plan shall be considered as a
part of the overall design and include a mix of tree species a minimum of 1-
inch diameter at breast height at planting, to be planted at 30-foot centers.
The total number of trees necessary shall be determined by the combined footage
of the front and side line defining the streetscape yard. Shrubbery, ground
cover and other planting materials shall be used to complement the tree
planting, but shall not be the sole contribution to the landscaping. Effective
use of earth berms, existing topography, and existing trees is also encouraged
as a component of the landscape plan and shall be considered as a part of the
planting requirements. Any plant materials that die or are destroyed and, which
are part of overall landscape plan must be replaced in a timely manner.
   Table 1: Required Building Setbacks.
 
Building Size (square feet) Setback (minimum)
7,999 or less               See applicable regulations
8,000 – 24,999            75 feet
25,000 – 49,999           100 feet
50,000 – 74,999           150 feet
75,000 or greater           200 feet
 
   (D)   Outdoor storage areas. The project shall mitigate visual and noise
impacts on public streets, residential uses, residentially zoned properties,
and/or an agricultural use or agriculturally zoned properties that the
Comprehensive Plan does not anticipate as commercial use in a Land Use Group
Map adjacent to the site and when permitted by the zone district requirements.
The mitigation can be accomplished by locating these areas on-site with minimum
setbacks. Table 1 lists the minimum setbacks. The areas should be screened or
enclosed so that they are not visible from streets, public sidewalks, internal
pedestrian walkways, or adjacent residential properties. The screen shall be of
masonry construction or other approved material (such as wrought iron fences or
other suitable opaque materials) and a height that will be effective in
obstructing storage materials and to assure the highest level of noise
abatement and to confine any loose papers, cartons, and other trash. Storage
materials should not be visible above the screen wall. It would be preferred
that these outdoor storage areas be placed between buildings in a manner which
would allow the buildings to act as screens.
   (E)   Trash collection areas. The project shall mitigate visual and noise
impacts, on public streets and adjoining residential neighborhoods from trash
collection areas by locating these areas on-site away from any residential use,
residentially zoned property, and/or an agricultural use or agriculturally
zoned property that the Comprehensive Plan does not anticipate as commercial
use in a Land Use Group Map adjacent to the site. (Setbacks listed in Table 1
above). The areas should be screened or enclosed so that they are not visible
from public streets, public sidewalks, internal pedestrian walkways, or
adjacent residential properties. Screening and landscaping of these areas shall
conform to the predominant materials used on the site. The screen shall be of
masonry construction or other approved material (such as wrought iron fences or
other suitable opaque materials) and a height that will be effective to ensure
the highest level of noise abatement and to confine any loose papers, cartons,
and other trash. It would be preferred that these trash collection areas be
placed between buildings to allow the buildings to act as screens.
   (F)   Pedestrian flows. The project shall provide pedestrian accessibility,
safety, and convenience to reduce traffic impacts and enable the development to
project a friendly, inviting image. Sidewalks shall be at least five feet wide
and unobstructed and shall connect the public street sidewalks, the main
entrances to the stores, transit stops on or off-site, and other buildings on
the site, in addition to providing convenient access to adjacent residential
neighborhoods. Sidewalks shall be provided along the full length of any
building where it adjoins a parking lot (six feet wide). Sidewalks shall have
an associated three foot wide landscape strip for their entire length, except
at intersections with parking area access lanes. (When no public sidewalks
exist, the developer must provide a five foot wide sidewalk along street right-
of-way that must be approved by the City or County Engineer). The landscaping
shall include canopy trees or other shading devices to shade at least 65% to
75% of the sidewalks during the major part of the day (shadow pattern needs to
be taken into consideration). Walkways located within parking areas to provide
safe pedestrian access from parking lot to retail business.
   (G)   Central features and community spaces. The project is to provide
attractive and inviting pedestrian scale features, spaces, and amenities.
Entrances and parking lot locations shall be functional and inviting with
walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations. Walkways located within
parking areas to provide safe pedestrian access from parking lot to retail
business. Bus stops should be considered integral parts of the configuration
whether they are located on-site or along the street. Customer drop-off/pick-up
points that may be provided should also be integrated into the design (should
not conflict with traffic lanes or pedestrian paths). Pedestrian ways shall be
anchored by special design features, such as towers, arcades, porticos, light
fixtures, planter walls, seating areas, and other architectural features that
define circulation paths and outdoor spaces. Examples are outdoor plazas,
patios, courtyards, and window shopping areas. Each development should have at
least two of these. (See figure 2)
Figure 2: Example of a center with numerous special features and community
spaces.

Guidelines for Large Establishments)
   (H)   Delivery and loading spaces. Delivery and loading operations shall be
designed and located to mitigate visual and noise impacts to adjoining
residential neighborhoods. Delivery and loading spaces shall be set back from a
residential use or residentially zoned property and/or an agricultural use or
agriculturally zoned property that the Comprehensive Plan does not anticipate
as commercial use in a Land Use Group Map adjacent to the site, (Setbacks
listed in Table 1 above) unless such operations are located entirely within an
enclosed building, provided it is no closer than the allowable building
setback. The delivery and loading areas shall be screened or enclosed so that
they are not visible from public streets, public sidewalks, internal pedestrian
walkways, or adjacent properties. The screen shall be of masonry construction
and at least ten feet high, measured from the loading dock floor elevation, to
screen the noise and activity at the loading dock. The masonry screen assures
the highest level of noise abatement. It would be preferred that the delivery
and loading spaces be enclosed within a building or placed between buildings in
a manner which would allow the buildings to act as screens.
   (I)   Traffic impacts study. The Applicant shall have a professional entity
perform a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) for the development using the Institute
of Transportation Engineers’ Trip Generation publication as the standard for
trip generation calculation. The scope and criteria for the study shall also
conform to the Kentucky Department of Transportation (KDOT). The TIA shall
identify traffic flow impacts on the public streets; recommend mitigation
measures to address those conditions that fall below the standards established
by the KDOT; and show how the applicant will provide the recommended
improvements. If agreed upon the legislative body may provide the study and be
reimbursed by the applicant.
   (J)   Outdoor lighting.
      (1)   Lighting policies have been developed to insure adequate security,
to prevent glare which affects approaching motorists and pedestrians, and to
minimize light trespassing onto adjoining properties. Horizontally mounted
fixtures with full cut-off shall be utilized. The maximum height of lighting
poles shall be 25 feet. The applicant may request a variance for up to 40 feet
if the setback from a public road is sufficient and the proposed lighting
satisfies the requirements set forth in this section. The property lighting
shall not exceed 0.5 foot candles at the property line. Architectural and
decorative lighting shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Outdoor
lighting between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. shall be limited to low-pressure
sodium lighting.
      (2)   A photometric plan and outdoor lighting report shall be submitted
that addresses all aspects of property illumination, including but not limited
to the parking area, building, parking, and signage. How outdoor lighting is
addressed to mitigate negative impacts on adjacent residential uses or
residentially zoned properties. The report will also address the negative
impacts of outdoor lighting between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on
adjacent properties and discuss methods of mitigation.
   (K)   Outdoor sales display/ancillary uses. The applicant shall identify
measures to mitigate any negative impacts to a residential use or residentially
zoned and/or an agricultural use or agriculturally zoned property that the
Comprehensive Plan does not anticipate as commercial use in a Land Use Group
Map. Property that is adjacent to the site from the location of any outdoor
activity associated with services to the public, such as, but not limited to,
outdoor merchandise display and sales, outdoor storage, and outdoor snack bar
and eating areas. The outside activity will be set back at least 100 feet and
oriented to face away from any residential use or residentially zoned property
and/or an agricultural use or agriculturally zoned property that the
Comprehensive Plan does not anticipate as commercial use in a Land Use Group
Map that is adjacent to the site, unless a building is located between the
activity and the restricted area. Approved screening from the public view is
required when Outdoor Sales Display/Ancillary Uses are needed.
   (L)   Signage. The visual transfer of business advertising and other public
information through the use of external signs shall comply with all applicable
sign ordinances and the following design standards. All completed signs must
have a high quality professional appearance. Sign materials, colors, and shades
shall be compatible with the related buildings on the property and shall be
limited to high quality construction materials, such as stone, brick, or
decorative block, finished wood (painted or stained), finished metal, or, high
quality plastic. External lighting of monument signs shall be concealed and
ground-mounted. Illumination of signs shall be directed away from all traffic
and from all adjoining residential areas. The intensity of the light shall not
exceed 15 foot candles at any point on the sign face. All signage plans shall
be submitted to the Planning Commission Director for administrative review and
approval, and a sign permit shall be obtained from the Planning Commission for
all approved signage.

§ 157.05 AESTHETIC CHARACTER OF BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Facades and exterior walls, including sides and back facades. The
building shall be designed in a way which will reduce the massive scale and
uniform and impersonal appearance and will provide visual interest consistent
with the community’s identity, character, and scale. Long building walls shall
be broken up with projections or recessions. Developments with facade over 100
feet in linear length shall incorporate wall projections or recesses a minimum
of three foot depth and a minimum of 20 contiguous feet within each 100 feet of
facade length and shall extend over 20% of facade. The building design should
include windows, arcades, or awnings along at least 60% of the building length.
Architectural treatment, similar to that provided to the front facade, shall be
provided to the sides and rear (rear only as needed) of the building to
mitigate any negative view from adjacent properties and/or roads. Development
shall use animating features such as arcades, display windows, entry areas, or
awnings along at least 60% of the facade. Figures 3 and 4 show examples of
facade standards.

   (B)   Detail features. Provide architectural features that contribute to
visual interest at the pedestrian scale and reduce the massive aesthetic effect
by breaking up the building wall, front, side, or rear, with color, texture
change, wall offsets, reveals, or projecting ribs. Figure 4 shows an expression
of architectural or structural bay.
   (C)   Roofs.   The roof design shall provide variations in roof lines to add
interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large buildings. Roof features
shall complement the architectural and visual character of the community
character/aesthetic. Roof lines shall be varied with a change in height every
100 linear feet in the building length. Parapets, mansard roofs, gable roofs,
hip roofs, or dormers shall be used to conceal flat roofs and roof top
equipment from public view. Parapet walls shall be architecturally treated to
avoid a plain, monotonous look. Figure 5 provides an example of parapet design.

Community area and/or in keeping with the rural theme of Nelson County. This
includes the use of high-quality materials and colors that are low reflective,
subtle, neutral, or earth tone. Certain types of colors shall be avoided, e.g.,
fluorescent or metallic. Construction materials, such as tilt-up concrete,
smooth-faced concrete block, vinyl siding, prefabricated steel panels, and
other similar material shall be avoided.
   (E)   Entryways. The building design shall provide design elements which
give customers orientation on accessibility and which add aesthetically
pleasing character to buildings by providing clearly-defined, highly-visible
customer entrances.
   (F)   Screening of Equipment. Roof- or ground-mounted HVAC or other
equipment shall be screened to mitigate noise and views in all directions. If
roof mounted, the screen shall be designed to conform architecturally with the
design of the building, whether it is with varying roof planes or with parapet
walls. A wood fence or similar treatment is not acceptable. Ground-mounted HVAC
or other equipment shall be screened. The screen shall be of masonry
construction or other approved materials and be of sufficient height to block
the view and noise of the equipment.
