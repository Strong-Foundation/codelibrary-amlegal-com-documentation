(Ord. 4-92 § 6.2, passed 5-26-1992)
   (C)   Woodford County Ambulance Policy.
      (1)   It is the policy of the Woodford County Fiscal Court to ensure that
emergency ambulance service is readily available to persons in Woodford County
at all times, and in order to assure the best possible service adopts the
following ambulance policies:
         (a)   Emergency requests for ambulance service take precedence over
nonemergency requests for service, for transfers from one medical facility to
another and for transfers from a medical facility to a residence. When one
ambulance is responding to a call, the next ambulance shall respond to
emergency calls only.
         (b)   Emergency ambulance responses will be made in as expeditious a
manner as possible with due regard to safety. Patients will be taken to the
nearest appropriate medical facility unless that facility indicates that they
cannot accept the patient at that time, in which case the EMTs will take the
patient to another suitable facility. The EMT attending the patient will make
the choice of the nearest appropriate facility. Requests by the patient or the
patient’s family to be taken to a particular facility will be evaluated in the
light of the above statement. The medical condition of the patient, time,
distance, and weather and road conditions and the appropriateness of the
facility shall, however, remain the determining factors as to which facility
the patient should be taken;
         (c)   Nonemergency ambulance responses may be made when sufficient
vehicles and personnel are available so as not to hamper the ability to render
sufficient emergency service. In the event that sufficient vehicles and
personnel are unavailable to render adequate emergency service, then
nonemergency service must be delayed. Ambulance Service personnel shall assist
nonemergency patients in obtaining alternative service if it is requested. As
soon as appropriate vehicles and staff are available, the nonemergency service
may be rendered;
         (d)   Patients requesting nonemergency transportation will be
transported to the facility of their choice if it is within 50 miles of
Versailles unless their condition, in the opinion of the attending EMT, becomes
an emergency, in which case the ambulance shall divert to the nearest
appropriate facility. Persons desiring transportation beyond 50 miles should
contact a private ambulance service. Transportation beyond 50 miles in a county
ambulance must have approval of the Director and the County Judge/Executive;
         (e)   Patients requiring nonemergency transportation from a location
outside Woodford County back to Woodford County will be transported in
accordance with the provisions of divisions (1)(c) and (d) above;
         (f)   Patients requiring specialized services during transfer such as
intravenous infusion, advanced life support, or other services which are beyond
the authorization of an EMT to perform shall be accompanied by a person or
persons authorized to perform the service required. It must be understood that
EMTs cannot perform any service with regard to intravenous therapy, drug
therapy or advanced life support, as mandated by law;
(Ord. passed 4-14-1987)
         (g)   Patients who suffer cardiac arrest during transport to a medical
facility will be treated as a full code (unless the patient has an EMS DNR),
using all available life support systems, to that medical facility; and
         (h)   Deceased persons pronounced dead by the Coroner will not be
transported to a medical facility or funeral home by ambulance.
      (2)   Long-distance or out-of-state trips will be arranged to provide a
service for Woodford County citizens. To avoid affecting the efficiency or
preparedness of the Ambulance Service while providing that service, the
Ambulance Service shall charge for this service at a rate that will not create
a cost increase for the Ambulance Service or unfair competition for private
services.
         (a)   The person requesting the service must be a citizen of Woodford
County;
         (b)   The trip must not be beyond a 400-mile radius of Woodford County
(2-day trip maximum);
         (c)   The trips must be individually authorized by the County Judge/
Executive, the Fiscal Court or the Ambulance Service administration. This
authorization will be based on the following:
            1.   The availability and readiness of the equipment, not only for
the requested trip but to meet the ongoing need of the county;
            2.   The availability of the required personnel;
            3.   An assessment of need; and
            4.   Knowledge that a private service is not available or is not
satisfactory for the particular request.
         (d)   The total charge for the trip shall be the total of the
following:
            1.   Actual expenses incurred, including but not limited to salary,
meals, lodging, fuel and oil; and
            2.   Mileage of $0.50 per mile traveled.
         (e)   The rates will be adjusted if they prove to provide an increased
operational cost to the Ambulance Service or if they create unfair competition
to private services.
(Ord. 4-92 § 6.3, passed 5-26-1992)
   (D)   Woodford County ambulance boundaries.
      (1)   Normal operating boundaries for the Woodford County Ambulance
Service shall include:
         (a)   The City of Versailles;
         (b)   The City of Midway;
         (c)   All of Woodford County;
         (d)   All counties surrounding Woodford County specified as:

Executive’s Office. It shall be the duty of the Woodford County Sheriff and the
Woodford County Court Clerk to establish and maintain a purchase order number
system, which comports with the system employed by Woodford County Government.

standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards with which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply while
conducting their public duties.

KRS 65.003, as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.

   Consistent with the county’s policy to maintain a safe, healthy drug-free
work environment in compliance with the Drug-Free Work Place Act of 1988, being
41 USC §§ 701 et seq. and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of
1991, being 49 USC §§ 45101 et seq., and in the interest of assuring the safety
of the general public by employing persons in safety sensitive positions who do

strictly adhered to by Woodford County. For purposes of complying with federal
drug and alcohol regulations, the substance abuse testing procedures for
employees covered by the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991
being 49 USC §§ 45101 et seq., (Commercial Driver’s License) shall be
established and administered separately from the county’s overall substance
abuse testing program.

individual is considered to be UNDER THE INFLUENCE of a controlled substance
when a detectable amount of the substance is found in the individual’s body
that may impair the individual’s ability to safely and efficiently perform
assigned work.

§ 35.06 PRECONDITIONS TO TESTING.
   The county shall contract with a National Institute Drug Abuse certified
laboratory that has demonstrated experience and capability of quality control,

§ 35.07 TYPES OF TESTING.
   (A)   Pre-employment testing; safety sensitive positions. All offers of
employment (for safety sensitive positions) are made contingent upon passing a

a positive test may reapply for employment after 6 months. The records will be
sealed in the employee’s medical file.
   (B)   Reasonable suspicion.
      (1)   (a)   If an employee is having work performance problems or is

charge, with the concurrence of the Program Administrator, will require the
employee to submit to a breath test or urinalysis.
         (b)   The following conditions are signs of possible alcohol or drug
abuse (not all-inclusive):

      (2)   (a)   Supervisors must notify the Program Administrator and/or the
County Judge/Executive if they have reason to believe 1 or more of the above-
listed conditions is indicated, and that the substance abuse is affecting an
employee’s performance or behavior in any manner. Job performance and policy
violations must be specific.
         (b)   The Program Administrator will arrange to observe or talk to the
employee. If the Program Administrator and supervisor concur on reasonable
suspicion, the Program Administrator will immediately arrange for the specified
test.
         (c)   The employee will be required to release any evidence relating
to the observation for further testing. Failure to comply may subject the
employee to subsequent discipline or suspension. All confiscated evidence will
be receipted for with signatures of both the receiving supervisor and the
provider.
         (d)   If, upon confrontation by the supervisor, the employee admits to
use but requests assistance, the Program Administrator will arrange for
assessment by the substance abuse professional. Reassignment to job duties will
be conditioned on completing the substance abuse professional’s guidelines and
return-to-work testing.
         (e)   The supervisor shall, within 24 hours, or before the results of
the alcohol or controlled substance testing are released, document the
particular facts related to the behavior or performance problems and present
documentation to the Program Administrator.
         (f)   The Program Administrator shall cause the removal of the
employee from county property and ensure that the employee is transported to
the collection site. Under no circumstances will the employee be allowed to
drive any county vehicle until a confirmed negative test result is received.
         (g)   All supervisors will receive a minimum of 1 hour training on
alcohol abuse and 1 hour training on drug abuse to assist them in identifying
abuse behavioral characteristics.
   (C)   Post-accident testing.  
      (1)   An accident is an incident which results in the death of a human
being or bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, received
medical treatment away from the scene of an accident; or any motor vehicle
accident regardless of the severity. The county may require testing on minor
accidents if there is reasonable suspicion that alcohol or drugs were involved.
      (2)   All employees are required to provide a breath test and a urine
specimen to be tested within 2 hours after an accident. If documented,
mitigating circumstances prohibit the employee from reaching the testing site
within 2 hours, they are still to report as soon as possible for testing.
Situations resulting in delay must be documented by the employee and the
supervisor of the work area. The employee shall remain readily available for
testing or he or she will be deemed to have refused testing. If the employee is
seriously injured and cannot provide a specimen at the time of the accident, he
or she shall provide the necessary authorization for obtaining the hospital
reports and other documents that would indicate whether there were any
controlled substances in his or her system.
      (3)   Adherence to post-accident testing requirements is a condition of
continued employment with the county.
   (D)   Mandatory random selection. In addition to employees required to be
randomly tested by the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991,
being 49 USC §§ 45101 et seq., the county will conduct mandatory random testing
for all employees who perform safety sensitive functions as follows:
      (1)   A selection process, which removes discretion in selection, will be
adopted by a majority vote of the Fiscal Court;
      (2)   The random testing will be reasonably spaced over a 12-month
period; and
      (3)   Once notified, the employee will immediately proceed to the
collection site. The employee will not be notified prior to duty that he or she
is to be tested. If the employee is not scheduled to work within 72 hours he or
she will not be randomly tested until drawn again.
   (E)   Return-to-duty testing. Before an employee returns to duty after
engaging in conduct prohibited by this policy, the employee shall undergo a
return-to-duty alcohol test with a result of less than a 0.02 breath alcohol
concentration (BAC) or receive a confirmed negative result from a controlled
substance urinalysis test.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998; Am. Order 9, passed 1-12-2000)
§ 35.08 COLLECTION OF SPECIMENS; LABORATORY ANALYSIS.
   (A)   Breath alcohol testing. A qualified breath alcohol technician
according to 49 C.F.R. pt. 40 procedures will conduct breath alcohol testing at
a prearranged location. Refusal to provide breath will be considered a positive
test and the employee will be removed from a safety sensitive function until
resolved.
   (B)   Specimen collection. Specimen collection will be conducted in
accordance with applicable state and federal law. The collection procedures
will be designed to ensure the security and integrity of the specimen provided
by each employee, and those procedures will strictly follow federal chain-of-
custody guidelines. Every effort will be made to maintain the dignity of each
employee submitting specimen for analysis in accordance with these procedures.
   (C)   Laboratory analysis. Only a laboratory certified by the Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS) to perform urinalysis for the detection of the
presence of controlled substances will be retained by the county. The
laboratory will be required to maintain strict compliance with federally
approved chain-of-custody procedures, quality control, maintenance and
scientific analytical methodologies.
   (D)   Follow-up testing. Following a determination that an employee is in
need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and/or
use of controlled substances, the county shall see that the employee is subject
to unannounced follow-up testing as directed by the substance abuse
professional, as required by 382 C.F.R. 605(c)(2)(ii). Follow-up alcohol
testing shall be conducted only when the employee is performing safety
sensitive functions, just before the employee is to perform or just after the
employee has performed safety sensitive functions.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998; Am. Order 9, passed 1-12-2000)
§ 35.09 CONSEQUENCES; APPEAL OF TEST RESULTS.
   (A)   (1)   An employee testing positive for alcohol or drug use is subject
to disciplinary action. Refusal to submit to testing will also be considered a
positive test. REFUSAL includes not providing a breath or urine sample as
directed, neglecting to sign appropriate control forms, using alcohol within 8
hours of an accident unless a test sample has been taken earlier, or engaging
in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process.
      (2)   Any employee testing positive for the presence of a controlled
substance will be contacted by the county’s Medical Review Officer. The
employee will be allowed to explain and present medical documentation to
explain any permissible use of drugs. All discussions between the employee and
the Medical Review Officer will be confidential. The employee may seek
assistance from a substance abuse professional who, in conjunction with the
Medical Review Officer, will take appropriate action, which may include
diagnosing the problem and recommending treatment.
   (B)   Within 72 hours after the employee has been notified of a positive
test result for drugs, he or she may request a retest of the split sample. The
signed request will be provided to the Medical Review Officer in writing, who
will then initiate the new laboratory analysis. If the subsequent laboratory
detects a different result, the test will be voided by the Medical Review
Officer, and the Program Administrator will be notified. A new sample may be
requested as appropriate.
   (C)   The employee may seek assistance from a substance abuse professional
who, in conjunction with the Medical Review Officer, will take appropriate
action, which may include diagnosing the problem and recommending treatment.
      (1)   If the employee acknowledges a substance abuse problem, requests
assistance and completes the substance abuse treatment recommended by the
substance abuse professional, these may be considered to be mitigating factors.
      (2)   The employee’s successful completion of an approved treatment
program may be a condition of continued employment.
      (3)   An employee will be required to submit to at least 6 unannounced
drug tests during the first year and follow-up testing may be conducted for up
to 60 months. Failure to adhere to this condition is grounds for immediate
termination.
      (4)   Nothing in these policies shall be deemed as precluding the county
from dismissing any employee who has been found to be in violation of these
policies. There is no express responsibility to retain an employee or to
provide assistance beyond referral information regarding rehabilitative
resources.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998; Am. Order 9, passed 1-12-2000)
§ 35.10 CONFIDENTIALITY.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 36.001 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Woodford County Fiscal Court recognizes that a personnel system
which recruits competent, dependable employees is indispensable to effective
and efficient county government. These personnel policies and procedures have
been developed in order to achieve optimum efficiency, economy and equity in
the pursuit of the county’s goals and the utilization of its human resources.
   (B)   The policies and procedures set forth hereinafter are intended to
implement the personnel provisions by providing procedures for:
      (1)   Classifying positions in the county service;
      (2)   Recruiting persons for that service; and
      (3)   Compensating employees equitably for their service to the county.
   (C)   While the county is committed to the equitable treatment of its
employees, it is expressly noted that nothing in these policies is intended to
create a contract of employment. Any individual may voluntarily leave
employment or may be terminated by the county at any time, for any lawful
reason, or for no reason at all. Any oral, written statements, custom or course
of dealing to the contrary are hereby expressly disavowed.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998)
§ 36.002 SCOPE OF COVERAGE.

(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998)
§ 36.003 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The effective date of this chapter is July 1, 1998 and subsequently amended.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998)
§ 36.004 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.
   (A)   The Woodford County Fiscal Court seeks to provide equal employment
opportunity for all persons regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age,
marital status, national origin, citizenship status, disability or veteran
status. Equal opportunity extends to all aspects of the employment
relationship, including hiring, transfers, promotions, training, terminations,
working conditions, compensation, benefits, and other terms and conditions of
employment.
   (B)   The Woodford County Fiscal Court complies with federal and state equal
employment opportunity laws and strives to keep the workplace free from all
forms of harassment, including sexual harassment. The Woodford County Fiscal
Court considers harassment in all forms to be a serious offense.
   (C)   Employees who have been subject to prohibited discrimination or
harassment should immediately report the incident to their supervisor, the
Personnel Administrator or County Judge/Executive. Complaints are investigated
immediately and handled as confidentially as possible. The Woodford County
Fiscal Court ensures that employees following this complaint procedure are
protected against illegal retaliation.
   (D)   Any reported violations of EEO law or this policy are investigated.
Supervisors or employees found to have engaged in discriminatory conduct or
harassment are subject to immediate disciplinary action, including possible
termination of employment.
§ 36.005 AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES.
   (A)   Woodford County complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability and protects qualified applicants and
employees with disabilities from discrimination in hiring, promotion,
discharge, pay, job training, fringe benefits and other aspects of employment.
   (B)   The county will provide reasonable accommodation to qualified
individuals with a disability who, with or without an accommodation, can
perform the essential functions of the job, unless the accommodation will
impose an undue hardship for the county.
      (1)   Any person (employee or citizen) who believes that he or she has
been subjected to prohibited discrimination may personally or by a
representative file a complaint with the office of the County Judge/Executive.
A person who has not personally been subjected to discrimination may also file
a complaint.
      (2)   When a person (citizen, applicant or employee) believes he or she

act or decision was based on handicapped status, that person shall have the

been made at least 5 days prior to the next scheduled Fiscal Court meeting. If
not, then the meeting shall be at the subsequent meeting.
          (e)   Step Five: The Judge/Executive, with the approval of the Fiscal
Court, shall respond in writing within 10 calendar days of the Fiscal Court
meeting with the aggrieved person. The decision shall be the final procedure
for the complainant at the local level.

the aggrieved person and the Judge/Executive and the Woodford County Fiscal
Court shall be prepared and shall be preserved in the records of the Woodford
County Fiscal Court.

§ 36.006 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   It shall be the policy of the Woodford County Fiscal Court that its

to sign assuring compliance.
   (B)   It is the policy of Woodford County Fiscal Court that no employee
shall engage in unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or
use of a controlled substance in the workplace. Controlled substances means a
controlled substance in Schedules I through V of the Controlled Substances Act
(21 U.S.C. 812), and as further defined by regulation at 21 C.F.R. 1308.11
through 1308.15, including any future additions or amendments.
   (C)   The purpose of this policy is to avoid the dangers of drugs in the

advise employees of available sources of counseling, rehabilitation and
employee assistance.
   (D)   Each employee is notified hereby that he or she shall notify the
County Judge/Executive and Department Head within 5 days of any criminal drug
statute conviction for a violation in the workplace. Within 30 days, the county
shall take appropriate action.
   (E)   Employees found to be abusing drugs, but not convicted of any drug
statute violation, will be subject to appropriate personnel action up to and
including termination, or be required to participate satisfactorily in a drug
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for those purposes. The
employer is not required to pay for this rehabilitation.
   (F)   Any employee violating the terms of this policy is subject to
immediate dismissal.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998)
§ 36.007 HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Commitment.  Woodford County is committed to maintaining a work
environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. In keeping with this
commitment, the county will not tolerate harassing conduct that affects
tangible job benefits, that interferes with an individual’s work performance,
or that creates an intimidating, hostile, offensive working environment by
anyone, including any supervisor, coworker, vendor, client or citizen.
   (B)   Definition.  
      (1)   Harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national
origin, age or disability constitutes discrimination in the terms, conditions
and privileges of employment. Harassment is verbal, physical or visual conduct
that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of
his or her race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age or disability,
or that of his or her relatives, friends or associates, and that:
         (a)   Has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile
or offensive work environment;
         (b)   Has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
individual’s work performance; or
         (c)   Otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment
opportunities.
      (2)   Harassing conduct includes but is not limited to the following:
         (a)   Epithets, slurs, negative stereotyping, or threatening,
intimidating or hostile acts, which relate to race, color, religion, gender,
national origin, age or disability; and
         (b)   Written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility
or aversion toward an individual or group because of race, color, religion,
gender, national origin, age or disability and that is placed on walls,
bulletin boards or elsewhere on the employer’s premises, or circulated in the
workplace.
   (C)   Complaint procedures.  Employees encountering harassment should tell
the offending person that his or her actions are inappropriate and offensive.
The employee shall document all incidents of harassment in order to provide the
fullest basis for investigation. In addition, the employee shall notify his or
her supervisor of the harassment, as soon as possible, so that steps may be
taken to protect the employee from further harassment, and appropriate
investigative and disciplinary measures may be initiated.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998)
§ 36.008 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Compliance. Woodford County is aware of, and complies with, all
federal and state equal opportunity laws, which make it illegal for sexual
harassment to occur within the work place.
   (B)   Definition.
      (1)   EEOC defines sexual harassment as “unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of sexual
nature” which constitute unlawful sex discrimination when:
         (a)   Submission to the conduct is either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual’s employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of the conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decision affecting that individual; and/or
         (c)   The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Sexual harassment may include explicit sexual propositions, sexual
innuendo, suggestive comments, sexual-oriented kidding or teasing, practical
jokes; jokes about gender-specific traits; foul or obscene language or
gestures; displays of foul or obscene language or gestures; displays of foul or
obscene printed or visual material; and physical contact, such as patting,
pinching or brushing against another’s body.
   (C)   Complaint procedures.  
      (1)   All employees are responsible for helping to assure the county
avoids harassment, and have the responsibility for reporting any occurrence of
harassment or sexual harassment. If an employee feels that he or she has
experienced or witnessed harassment, the employee is to notify his or her
immediate supervisor, the Personnel Administrator or County Judge/Executive.
Employees may request to report the harassment to a member of a specific sex.
Such request should be made to their supervisor, County Judge/Executive, or
Personnel Administrator. Reports are to be made as soon as practicable within
24 hours, and preferably in writing. Verbal reports, however, will also be
taken in the case of unusually sensitive circumstances.
      (2)   The county’s policy is to investigate all such complaints. To the
fullest extent practicable, the county will keep complaints and terms of their
resolution confidential. If an investigation confirms that harassment has
occurred, the county will take corrective action in accordance with the nature
and extent of the offense. The county also prohibits retaliation against any
employee bringing a claim of sexual harassment.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998)
§ 36.009 HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT; FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND EMPLOYMENT

accusation of harassment and sexual harassment can have a serious effect on
innocent men and women. Individuals falsely accusing another of harassment or
sexual harassment will be disciplined in accordance with the nature and extent
of his or her false accusation.

raise questions he or she may have regarding the harassment policy or sexual
harassment, with his or her immediate supervisor, a higher-level manager, the

employment.
   (B)   Common infractions. The following is a list of common infractions.

   (A)   Verbal warning.
      (1)   In the case of a minor infraction, the immediate supervisor or
Department Head or County Judge/Executive shall administer the verbal reprimand
without rancor and explain the actions necessary to correct the problem as soon
as possible after the offense.
      (2)   The date of the verbal reprimand, along with a description of the
occurrence which prompted the reprimand and any comments the employee may have
made, shall be noted by the person giving the reprimand in his or her own
supervisory file. A copy shall be forwarded to the Personnel Administrator.
Verbal warnings shall be taken out of folder after 3 years.
   (B)   Written warning.
      (1)   In the case of either a second minor infraction or a more serious
first infraction, the immediate supervisor or Department Head or County Judge/

the warning and noting any previous verbal and/or written warnings.
      (2)   Written warnings shall state that the employer’s expectation of the
employee and the dates the employee’s performance will now be reviewed for
improvement. Written warnings shall explain the consequences of continued
infractions.
      (3)   The employee shall sign the written warning or a witness shall sign
the warning; a copy of the written warning shall be forwarded to the Personnel
Officer to be placed in the employee’s personnel file.
   (C)   Suspension, with or without pay.  
      (1)   In situations where the county has become aware of alleged
misconduct by an employee which, if substantiated, could result in disciplinary
action, the Judge/Executive with approval of the Fiscal Court may suspend the
employee with or without pay, if it is determined the action is necessary to
assure public confidence in governmental oversight of its employees, or to
assure the integrity of the county’s inquiry into the allegations.
      (2)   In situations where the infraction puts other employees or citizens
at risk, or creates a hostile work environment as defined in the harassment and
sexual harassment policies, the Department Head may relieve an employee of his
or her duties without consent until the Judge/Executive and the Fiscal Court
can be notified.
         (a)   After either a serious violation or repeated minor violations,
the supervisor or Department Head shall request, in writing, that the County
Judge/Executive suspend the employee with or without pay. The request shall
include the reason(s) for the suspension, along with details of previous
disciplinary actions taken against the employee.

Court, may suspend an employee for any period up to and including 4 calendar
weeks, depending upon the offense’s severity.
         (c)   When a decision to suspend an employee is made, the County
Judge/Executive shall provide written notification to the employee within 3
working days. If possible, verbal notification shall be provided to the
employee immediately and followed by the written notice. The notice shall
include the reason(s) for and duration of the suspension.
         (d)   Consistent with existing personnel procedures, the county shall
immediately begin an investigation into the allegations against the employee.
This investigation shall be carried out expeditiously, and in no instance shall
it be delayed beyond what is considered reasonable and necessary to conduct a
complete investigation.
         (e)   Upon reaching a determination as to the culpability of the
employee, the appointing authority shall take action, as follows:
            1.   In the event the allegations against the employee are valid,
the appointing authority shall invoke disciplinary action as deemed
appropriate. These actions shall not include payment of wages in the event the
suspension is extended beyond the investigative period; or
            2.   In the event the allegations against the employee are proven
to be false, the employee shall immediately be reinstated to his or her
position. If the suspension was without pay, then the employee shall be paid
retroactive to the time of suspension.
         (f)   During the time an employee is on suspension, he or she is
considered to be performing services for the county. Therefore, the employee
must remain available to return to work within 24 hours of receiving written or
verbal confirmation of his or her reinstatement from the appointing authority.
In the event the employee is notified of this reinstatement verbally, the
county shall provide written verification within 1 working day.
         (g)   Nothing in this policy or procedure should be construed as
limiting the authority of the 1ocal government to suspend an employee without
pay in those instances where that action is deemed appropriate.

§ 36.053 RIGHT TO RESPOND.
   (A)   Although Woodford County has chosen to include an appeals process in
its personnel policies relating to employee termination, it is specifically not
the Fiscal Court’s intention to create any proprietary right or employment
situation that compromises its at-will employment status. As expressly stated
in this chapter’s Statement of Purpose in §
36.001, nothing in these policies is intended to create a contract of
employment.
   (B)   (1)   A regular full-time employee who has been notified of intent to
dismiss him or her has the right to appear personally or with counsel before
the Fiscal Court to respond to the letter of intent to dismiss.
      (2)   The written request to respond must be made within 5 working days
of the employee’s receipt of the letter of intent to dismiss, excluding the day
it was received. If the employee does not submit a request within 5 working
days, it will be deemed that the employee has waived his or her right to
respond.
      (3)   The right to respond meeting shall be at the next scheduled court
meeting if the request has been made at least 5 days prior to the Fiscal Court
meeting. If the request has not been made at least 5 days prior to the next
Fiscal Court meeting, the employee shall meet with the Fiscal Court at the
subsequent scheduled court meeting.
      (4)   The meeting is informal. It gives the employee the opportunity to
respond to charges contained in the letter of notice of intent to dismiss.
      (5)   Within 5 working days, excluding the day of the meeting, the Fiscal
Court shall uphold, alter, modify or rescind the intended dismissal. The
employee will be notified, in writing, of the Fiscal Court’s decision.
      (6)   The action shall be recorded in the employee’s personnel file.

may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment. (Exceptions to this include absences eligible for and covered by
Family and Medical Leave Act and Medical Leave of Absence policies of the
Woodford County Fiscal Court.)

   (E)   Employees absent because of sickness or off-duty injury or disability
may use accrued vacation leave during time off only after accrued sick leave
has been exhausted.
   (F)   Employees serving an initial introductory period may not take vacation
leave; employees on promotional introductory period may take accrued vacation
leave.
   (G)   Vacation leave should be requested 1 month in advance. Vacation leave
may be disapproved if the employee’s services are required at the requested
time.
   (H)   When a former employee is reinstated, the person shall be considered a
new employee for vacation leave purposes.
   (I)   Compensation in cash for vacation in lieu of time off shall not be
given.

   (K)   Employees shall be paid for accrued vacation when employment
terminates, if the 6-month initial introductory period has been completed.
   (L)   (1)   A maximum of 96 vacation hours may be carried over to the
following calendar year. On December 31 of each year, vacation hours in excess

January 1 of the following year.
      (2)   At the end of the 2004 calendar year, employees are allowed to
carry an amount no greater than their 2004 accrual. This allows employees time
to adjust to the new method of accruing time per month. After 2004, the policy
listed in division (L)(1) of this section will be in effect.
   (M)   Attendance. Attendance is a critical component of an employee’s
success in the workplace. In the event an employee exhausts the balance of
available sick, holiday and vacation hours and is off work without pay, they
may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment. (Exceptions to this include absences eligible for and covered by
Family and Medical Leave Act and Medical Leave of Absence policies of the
Woodford County Fiscal Court.)

§ 36.067 SICK LEAVE.
   (A)   Sick leave is provided so that an employee will not be seriously
handicapped financially if he or she is unable to work because of illness. Sick
leave abuse may be cause for dismissal.
   (B)   (1)   All employees occupying full-time regular positions shall
receive 8 hours of sick leave credit for each month of service. Exception:
Ambulance employees shall receive 12 hours of sick leave credit for each month
of service.
      (2)   Employees may utilize sick leave credit when they are unable to
perform their duties because of sickness or injury or when they are
quarantined, or when their absence from work is required due to sickness in the
immediate family or for scheduled doctor’s appointment for spouse, child or
parent (see Family and Medical Leave Act policy).
      (3)   All foreseeable leave for these purposes shall require specific
prior written approval of the Department Head. In the event sick leave is taken
for 3 consecutive 8-hour work days for any purpose, the Department Head or
Personnel Officer shall require a certificate from a medical doctor.
(Exception: Ambulance Department employees, after 2 consecutive 24-hour work
shifts.) The Department Head or Personnel Administrator has the authority to
request a medical statement if circumstances surrounding an absence of less
time warrants further documentation.
      (4)   For accrual purposes, a new employee who reports for work on or
before the fifteenth of the month shall accrue the full amount for that month;
if employed on or after the sixteenth, a new employee shall begin accruing sick
leave at the beginning of the following month.
      (5)   The county employees may accrue unlimited sick leave hours.
      (6)   Sick leave cannot be transferred to another employee.

sick leave and forward sick leave records to the Personnel Officer.
      (10)   Absences due to sickness, injury or disability in excess of
accumulated sick leave, at the request of the employee, and with the approval
of the Department Head, may be charged to vacation leave credit.
      (11)   Employees who terminate employment shall not be paid for unused
sick leave.
      (12)   Woodford County has adopted the Retirement Standard Sick Leave
Program with the County Employees Retirement System. At retirement, employees
shall receive service credit for unused sick leave to be used in determining
the employee’s retirement benefit. Woodford County shall make the payment for
accumulated sick leave up to the first 6 months (1,040 hours) of unused sick
leave. If the employee has over 6 months of accumulated sick leave, the
employee may pay the Retirement System for the remainder of accumulated sick
leave to receive additional service credit.
      (13)   (a)   Consistent with the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978,
pregnancy/childbirth shall be treated as a temporary disability, and is
eligible for use of sick leave. The ability of the employee to return to work
shall be determined by the employee’s physician, consistent with the individual
medical needs of the employee. Before returning to work the employee must
provide documentation from the physician indicating the employee may return to
her job.
         (b)   Employees absent from work due to pregnancy/childbirth may
utilize vacation leave after all sick leaves have been utilized. Leave beyond
this amount shall be leave without pay. During leave due to pregnancy/
childbirth, vacation days shall continue to accrue and shall be credited if the
employee returns to work. Insurance benefits will continue to be paid for full-
time employees who provide written certification of their intent to return to
work following childbirth. An employee who is not planning to return to work
following childbirth is requested to submit a timely resignation to allow the
county’s staffing needs to be met.
         (c)   To the extent possible, an employee shall submit her written
request for the leave in advance, indicating the approximate dates of absence
from work, and her anticipated return to work.
      (14)   Returning to work after absence. All employees returning to work
after more than 3 days off work due to illness, work-related injury or non-
work-related injury must provide a statement from a physician certifying their
fitness before they return to work. The statement must include any restrictions
to the employee’s ability to perform their duties and the potential impact any
prescribed or recommended medications may have on their ability to perform
their duties. Based on the restrictions provided, the Personnel Administrator
will recommend to the Judge/Executive whether the employee should be allowed to
return to work with the documented restrictions. Determining factors may
include duration of restrictions, safety of job site, etc.
   (C)   Attendance. Attendance is a critical component of an employee’s
success in the workplace. In the event an employee exhausts the balance of
available sick, holiday and vacation hours and is off work without pay, they
may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment. (Exceptions to this include absences eligible for and covered by
Family and Medical Leave Act and Medical Leave of Absence policies of the
Woodford County Fiscal Court.)

§ 36.068 BENEFIT LEAVE SHARING.
   (A)   (1)   Employees who accrue benefit leave (sick and vacation), and who
have exhausted their leave balances may have benefit time donated to them by
other eligible county employees. Both recipients and donors must meet the
definition of full-time employee of the Woodford County Fiscal Court or
Woodford County Detention Center.
      (2)   A donor may not donate an amount of leave which would cause his or
her sick leave balance to go below 160 hours or vacation leave to go below 80
hours.
      (3)   An employee becomes eligible to receive donated benefit leave when
the following criteria are met:
         (a)   The employee and absence qualifies for approved leave under the
guidelines of the Family and Medical Leave Act or the Woodford County Fiscal
Court Medical Leave of Absence Policy;
         (b)   The employee has exhausted all of his or her available paid
leave; and
         (c)   The employee has complied with administrative policy regarding
appropriate use of sick leave.
      (4)   The forms needed to receive or donate leave may be obtained from
the Personnel Administrator.
   (B)   Eligible recipients. Employees eligible to receive donated time must
be employees of the Woodford County Fiscal Court or Woodford County Detention
Center. Employees of other elected officials (i.e., County Clerk, County
Attorney, Sheriff, Coroner), are not eligible for this benefit unless
specifically authorized by the Woodford County Fiscal Court. The employee must
be on an approved leave of absence that qualifies for the Family and Medical
Leave Act or the Woodford County Fiscal Court Medical Leave of Absence. This
leave-sharing program may also be available to individuals who have exhausted
benefits under these policies, as long as the reason for time off work would
otherwise still qualify for 1 of these programs.
   (C)   Eligible donors. Employees eligible to donate leave time are those
employed directly by the Woodford County Fiscal Court or Woodford County
Detention Center. Employees of other elected officials (i.e., County Clerk,
County Attorney, Sheriff, Coroner), are not eligible for this benefit unless
specifically authorized by the Woodford County Fiscal Court.
   (D)   Procedure.  
      (1)   Recipient. Recipient completes application and submits it along
with physician’s certification (if applicable) to his or her Department Head
who, after signing the document, submits it to the Personnel Administrator. The
Personnel Administrator verifies that the employee will exhaust all accrued
benefit time during the projected absence. The employee does not have to have
exhausted all leave before submitting the application. The employee is then
notified whether the request has been approved or denied.
      (2)   Donor. Donor completes donation form and submits it to his or her
Department Head who, after signing the document, submits it to the Personnel
Administrator.
         (a)   The Personnel Administrator verifies the donor’s leave balance
eligible for donation. The employee is then notified whether the donation has
been approved or denied.
         (b)   The Personnel Administrator is responsible for transferring the
appropriate hours to the recipient. Copies of all donation and receipt records
will be kept in each affected employee’s confidential file separate from the
regular personnel file.
      (3)   Sequence of leave usage. Donated leave will be transferred to the
recipient at the time of donation, not on a pay-period basis, up to the amount
requested. As the recipient accrues leave of his or her own, that leave time
must be used first. Then, the donated time may be used.
       (4)   Recipient retaining leave after return to work. The recipient may
retain the donated leave upon return to work only if the recipient documents
that leave will be needed for continuing treatment relating to the condition
which caused the initial absence. For example, if the employee was absent due
to surgery to remove a malignant tumor and returns to work, but will require
periodic absences for radiation therapy, the excess leave may be retained for
that purpose. The employee may not retain the excess leave to be used for any
unrelated condition.
      (5)   Sequence of restoring unused leave to donors. When the recipient
returns to work and the donated leave is no longer needed for the qualifying
condition, excess leave shall be returned to donors in reverse order of
donation (last donor’s leave is returned first). If the donor has left
employment, the returned hours should be credited to the inactive record.
(Order passed 10-12-2004)
§ 36.069 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT.
   (A)   The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, being 29 USC §§ 2611
et seq., requires covered employers with at least 50 employees to provide
eligible employees with up to 12 workweeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a
12-month period for specified family and medical reasons. The FMLA applies to
all public agencies, including state, local and federal employers. Thus,
Woodford County is a “covered” employer as defined in the legislation.
   (B)   Employee eligibility.
      (1)   To be eligible for FMLA benefits, an employee must:
         (a)   Work for a covered employer;
         (b)   Have worked for the employer for a total of 12 months;
         (c)   Have worked at least 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months;
and
         (d)   Work at a location in the United States or in any territory or
possession of the United States where at least 50 employees are employed by the
employer within 75 miles.
      (2)   All full-time and part-time employees are eligible for this benefit
once they have met the eligibility requirements stated above.
   (C)   Leave entitlement.
      (1)   The county will grant an eligible employee up to a total of 12
workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period beginning from the date an
employee’s first FMLA leave begins, for 1 or more of the following reasons:
         (a)   For the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee;
         (b)   For placement with the employee of a son or daughter for
adoption or foster care;
         (c)   To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child or parent)
with a serious health condition; or
         (d)   To take medical leave when the employee is unable to work
because of a serious health condition.
      (2)   In the event the county employs both the husband and the wife, the
aggregate amount of leave allowed for purposes of childbirth or adoption, or
taking care of a sick parent is no more than 12 workweeks during any 12-month
period.
   (D)   Serious health condition.  In context of this policy, a SERIOUS HEALTH
CONDITION means an illness, injury impairment, or physical or mental condition
that involves 1 of the following:
      (1)   Hospital care. Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a
hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, including any period of
incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with or consequent to such
inpatient care;
      (2)   Absence plus treatment.  A period of incapacity of more than 3
consecutive days (including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity
relating to the same condition), that also involves:
         (a)   Treatment 2 or more times by a health care provider, by a nurse
or physician’s assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider, or
by a provider of health care services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders
of or on referral by a health care provider; or
         (b)   Treatment by a health care provider on at least 1 occasion which
results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the
health care provider.
      (3)   Pregnancy. Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for
prenatal care;
      (4)   Chronic conditions requiring treatment. A chronic condition which:
         (a)   Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care
provider, or by a nurse or physician’s assistant under direct supervision of a
health care provider;
         (b)   Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring
episodes of a single underlying condition); and
         (c)   May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity
(e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy and the like).
      (5)   Permanent/long-term conditions requiring supervision. A period of
incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which
treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the
continuing supervision of but need not be receiving active treatment by a
health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke or the
terminal stages of a disease; or
      (6)   Multiple treatments (nonchronic conditions). Any period of absence
to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery therefrom) by
a health care provider or by a provider of health care services under orders of
or on referral by a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after
an accident or other injury; or for a condition that would likely result in a
period of incapacity of more than 3 consecutive days in the absence of medical
intervention or treatment, such as cancer (chemotherapy, radiation and the
like), severe arthritis (physical therapy) and kidney disease (dialysis).
   (E)   Notice.  
      (1)   Birth or adoption of a child or foster care. Employees are required
to give 30 days’ notice of the need for leave when the need for leave is
foreseeable. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, the employee must give
as much notice as is reasonably practical. An employee’s right to leave for a
birth or placement for adoption or foster care expires at the end of the 12-
month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement.
      (2)   Planned medical treatment for serious health condition. Employees
are required to give 30 days’ notice unless there is a medical emergency or
unforeseen event. Where leave is necessary for planned medical treatment, the
employee is required to make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so
as not to unduly disrupt the county’s operations.
   (F)   Timing of leave. The 12 weeks’ leave may be taken consecutively or
intermittently if medically necessary. Employees needing intermittent FMLA
leave must attempt to schedule their leave so as not to disrupt the county’s
operations. The county reserves the right to assign the employee to an
alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits during the period of
intermittent leave, if the position better accommodates the employee’s need for
FMLA leave.
   (G)   Certification.  
      (1)   The county will require that a claim for medical leave be supported
by a medical care provider’s certification. To comply with this requirement,
any employee requesting the leave will be provided with a copy of Form WH-380,
Certification of Health Care Provider, developed and approved (March 1995) by
the United States Department of Labor.
      (2)   In the event the county has reason to doubt the adequacy of the
medical certification, the county may seek a second, nonbinding opinion at the
county’s expense. If that opinion differs from the opinion obtained by the
employee, a third, binding opinion can be obtained, at the county’s expense,
from a health care provider agreed upon by both the employee and the county.
   (H)   Substitution of paid leave. It is the policy of Woodford County that
employees will be required to substitute accumulated paid leave for FMLA leave.
Respectively, the employee shall utilize sick leave and vacation leave in place
of unpaid leave. To the extent the employee does not have 12 weeks of
accumulated leave, the remainder shall be unpaid leave.
   (I)   Benefits during leave.
      (1)   During the period of an employee’s FMLA leave the county will
continue to provide all health care benefits that are provided as part of the
employee’s employment. While an employee is on Family Medical leave he or she
shall continue to pay to the county any insurance premiums he or she is
currently paying by payroll deduction or make a written arrangement to adjust
payroll deductions when he or she returns to work. If arrangements are not made
to reimburse the county, then insurance coverage shall revert to a single plan,
and the employee shall sign all necessary papers.
      (2)   Sick, holiday and vacation leave shall accrue while an employee is
on Family Medical Leave.
   (J)   Rights and benefits upon return to work.
      (1)   Upon return to work from FMLA leave, an employee shall be restored
to the position he or she held when the leave began, or to an equivalent
position with equivalent pay, benefits and other terms and conditions of
employment. The FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit
that accrued prior to the start of an employee’s leave. In instances where an
employee has taken FMLA leave due to personal illness, the employee will be
required to provide certification from a medical care provider of the
employee’s fitness to return to work. If the employee does not return to work,
the balance of all unpaid insurance premiums shall be due within 30 days of the
last day of insurance coverage. If an employee does return to work and his or
her employment is terminated prior to full reimbursement to the county, the
balance of unpaid insurance premiums shall be due within 30 days of the last
day of insurance coverage.
      (2)   Exceptions to this policy shall be made as required to ensure
compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act.
      (3)   The county expressly reserves the right to deny the previous job to
key employees in instances where the restoration would result in substantial
and grievous economic injury to the county. KEY EMPLOYEE is defined as a
salaried FMLA-eligible employee who is among the highest-paid 10% of all county
employees.

to pay an employee prior to beginning the unpaid portion of the leave.
      (2)   During the period of an employee’s leave of absence, the county
will continue to provide all health care benefits that are provided as part of
the employee’s employment. While an employee is on leave he or she shall
continue to pay to the county any insurance premiums he or she is currently
paying by payroll deduction or make a written arrangement to adjust payroll
deductions upon return to work. If arrangements are not made to reimburse the
county, then insurance coverage shall revert to a single plan.
      (3)   Sick, holiday and vacation leave will not accrue while an employee
is on medical leave of absence.
   (F)   Rights and benefits upon return to work. Upon returning to work,

requires employers sponsoring group health plans to offer employees and certain
eligible dependents the opportunity to purchase a temporary extension of health
coverage, at group rates, in certain instances when coverage under the plan
would otherwise end. The following information is intended to give employees of
Woodford County information regarding their rights and obligations under this
federal legislation. Additional information may be obtained in the Judge/
Executive’s office.
      (2)   Qualifying events.  Employees and eligible dependents covered under
the county’s health and dental insurance plans are entitled to purchase
continuation coverage if a qualifying event, as described below, occurs:
         (a)   Termination of employment/reduction of hours. An employee and
his or her eligible dependents can purchase up to 18 months of COBRA coverage
if the employee (and his or her dependents) loses health coverage as a result
of the employee terminating employment (other than as a result of gross
misconduct) or reducing the employee’s hours of employment.
         (b)   Death, divorce, entitlement to Medicare or loss of dependent
status. An employee’s eligible dependents can purchase up to 36 months of COBRA
coverage if the dependents lose health coverage because of the employee’s
death, divorce/legal separation or entitlement to Medicare, or because the
dependent ceases to be an eligible dependent under the plan.
      (3)   Eligible dependent. A dependent is eligible to purchase COBRA
coverage if the dependent was covered under the group plan on the day before a
COBRA event and will lose coverage as a result of the COBRA event. Each
affected employee and dependent can make a separate election whether or not to
purchase COBRA coverage. An employee or dependent cannot, however, elect COBRA
if he or she was entitled to receive Medicare on the day before the COBRA
event.
      (4)   Employer notification of employee/dependent eligibility.  
         (a)   When the qualifying event is the employee’s termination of
employment, reduction of work hours or the employee’s eligibility for Medicare,
Woodford County shall notify the off-site service provider, if applicable,
within 30 days of the qualifying event. The service or court representative has
14 days to generate the qualifying event notice. All qualified beneficiaries
have 60 days from the later of the date of the notice or the loss of coverage
date to elect COBRA.
         (b)   When the qualifying event is the employee’s divorce, legal
separation or a dependent no longer meeting the plan’s definition of dependent,
the employee shall notify the employer within 60 days (from the later of the
date of the event or the date coverage is lost on account of the event).
      (5)   Time frame for selecting coverage. All qualified beneficiaries have
60 days from the later of the date of the notice or the loss of coverage date
to elect COBRA (according to regulations, the election is deemed made on the
date it is sent to the employer).
      (6)   Premium for COBRA coverage.  Employees or eligible dependents who
elect to purchase COBRA coverage may be charged 102% of the cost of providing
the coverage. Under certain circumstances, employees who are determined by the
Social Security Administration to be disabled when their employment is
terminated are entitled to extend their coverage from 18 months to 29 months.
In these cases the premium for the additional 9 months of coverage may be as
much as 150% of the cost of providing coverage.
      (7)   Payment of premium. The initial/retroactive premium (defined as the
premium due from the loss of coverage date to the COBRA election date) must be
made within 45 days after the date the employee or dependent elects to purchase
COBRA coverage. Additional premiums are due on the first of the month.
Qualified beneficiaries are allowed a grace period of 30 days.
      (8)   Termination of coverage. The COBRA coverage period will end on the
first to occur of the following dates:
         (a)   The date the 18-, 29- or 36-month maximum coverage period ends;
         (b)   The date the employer terminates all group health plans;
         (c)   The first day an employee or dependent fails to timely pay the
COBRA premiums;
         (d)   The date the employee or dependent is covered under another
group health plan, unless the other group plan excludes or limits coverage for
a preexisting condition affecting the employee or dependent; or
         (e)   The first date the employee or dependent is entitled to Medicare
benefits.
      (9)   This is intended to be a summary of employee rights under the COBRA
law. Details regarding individual benefits will be sent upon notification of a
qualifying event and will be subject to the laws and interpretations in force
at that time.
   (C)   Workers’ compensation insurance and safety policy.
      (1)   The health and safety of employees is a primary concern of Woodford
County. As a condition of employment, employees are required to comply with all
safety procedures that are established for the position held by the employee.
Additionally, any employee who becomes aware of any unsafe or hazardous
condition shall report the situation to his or her supervisor or the County
Judge/Executive immediately. Failure to comply with established workplace
safety rules, report workplace injuries or failure to report unsafe/hazardous
conditions of which the employee is aware will result in personnel action, up
to and including termination from employment.
      (2)   Woodford County carries workers’ compensation insurance. The
benefits of workers’ compensation for a job-related injury include payments for
lost income, medical treatment and new job training.
      (3)   All job-related injuries must be reported to the employee’s
immediate supervisor or the County Judge/Executive as soon as possible after
the injury occurs, but no later than the end of the work day/shift. A first
report of injury should be completed by the Department Head or his or her
designee within 24 hours of the notification of the injury by the employee and
submitted immediately to the Judge/Executive or his or her designee for
reporting to the county’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier.
      (4)   The workers’ compensation insurance carrier pays temporary total
disability (TTD) benefits during the period in which the worker is recovering
from an injury or disease and is unable to return to some type of work. TTD is
not payable unless the employee is unable to work for more than 7 days. Once an
employee misses 8 days from work due to a work-related injury, the employee is
entitled to benefits from the workers’ compensation insurance carrier for each
additional day he or she is unable to work. If the employee exceeds 14 days, he
or she is also entitled to the payment of benefits for the first 7 days.
      (5)   If the Department Head foresees that the employee will not be off
work for more than 14 days, the employee may use his or her accumulated sick
time for up to the first 7 days he or she is off work due to the job-related
injury.
      (6)   Sick, holiday and vacation leave shall accrue during the period an
employee is being paid disability benefits and is covered under the Family and
Medical Leave Act. If the employee is not eligible for FMLA or once the FMLA
benefits are exhausted, these benefit accruals will cease.
      (7)   At the end of an employee’s workers’ compensation disability leave,
the employee’s unused sick, holiday and vacation leave accruals shall be
resumed at the same levels as provided when the leave began. However, the
employee shall be subject to any changes affecting the entire work force that
may have taken place while the employee was on the leave.
      (8)   While an employee is on workers’ compensation leave, he or she
shall continue to pay to the county any insurance premiums currently being paid
by payroll deduction or make a written arrangement to adjust payroll deductions
when he or she returns to work. If arrangements are not made to reimburse the
county, then insurance coverage shall revert to a single plan and the employee
shall sign all necessary papers.
      (9)   If the employee does not return to work, the balance of all unpaid
insurance premiums shall be due within 30 days of the last day of insurance
coverage. If an employee does return to work and his or her employment is
terminated prior to full reimbursement to the county, the balance of unpaid
insurance premiums shall be due within 30 days of the last day of insurance
coverage.
      (10)   Employees who are eligible for the Family and Medical Leave Act
(FMLA) will be notified that this time will run concurrently with the time away
from work due to the work-related injury. This notification will be provided by
the Personnel Administrator and will include the information pertinent to the
benefits associated with the Family and Medical Leave Act.
(Order 9, passed 2-10-2004)
      (11)   Additional information on workers’ compensation may be obtained
from the office of the Judge/Executive.
   (D)   Unemployment insurance.  All employees are covered under this program.
Woodford County pays 100% of the cost for this coverage. An individual who
terminates his or her employment with the county may or may not be eligible to
receive payments under this program, depending upon the circumstances involved
in the termination.
   (E)   Social Security. The county and the employee both contribute to the
Social Security program at rates specified by the U.S. Congress.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998)
§ 36.077 EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE/CAREER DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Woodford County may pay for training and development classes for its
employees in an effort to enhance their professional and personal growth and to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the county’s programs and
operations. The county’s ability to provide for this training will depend upon
the availability of funds.
   (B)   Participation in career development programs must be approved in
advance by the County Judge/Executive.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998)
§ 36.078 INCLEMENT WEATHER.
   (A)   In the event of occurrence of bad weather conditions, the Courthouse
and the department offices may be closed at the direction of the County Judge/
Executive. In the event of a closure, county employees shall receive their
regular pay for the subject time period.
   (B)   Where individual circumstances exist, such as longer-than-average
distance of travel to and from the workplace, the employee must notify his or
her supervisor, and may exercise his or her own judgment in not reporting to
work. If county offices are not subsequently closed, this time off will be
charged at the discretion of the employee to vacation or holiday leave or leave
without pay.
(Order 10, passed 5-27-1998)
§ 36.079 EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT.
   (A)   Covered individuals.
      (1)   All employees who incur approved business expenses are reimbursed.
Employees who travel out of town on county business are reimbursed for their
transportation, meals, lodging and certain miscellaneous expenses while away
from home up to the limits described in this policy.
      (2)   Local transportation expenses for required business travel, other
than commuting to and from work, are reimbursed. Employees are paid a flat
mileage rate for use of their own vehicles, plus parking and tolls. Taxicab,
subway and bus fares also are reimbursed.
   (B)   Mileage reimbursement policy.
      (1)   When it is convenient for employees to use their personal vehicles
for county business, they are reimbursed for business travel at the approved
per-mile rate set by the Fiscal Court. Local travel expenses between the
employee’s home and assigned work location are not reimbursable. However, if
employees are required by business necessity to travel from home directly to a
site other than their assigned work location, the county will reimburse them
for the difference between the mileage in their normal commute to their
assigned work location and the total miles driven on business.
      (2)   The mileage reimbursement rate is determined using the American
Automobile Association (AAA) Daily Fuel Gauge Report for Kentucky for regular
unleaded gasoline. The gasoline cost used for the calculation is located on the
AAA website at http://198.6.95.31/kyavg.asp. The reimbursement rate will be
caluclated quarterly during the final calendar week of the quarter. If
appropriate, the reimbursement rate will fluctuate and be changed on January 1,
April 1, July and October 1 as follows:
 
AAA Average Weekly Fuel Cost Reimbursement per Mile
$.01 to $1.499               32 cents per mile
$1.50 to $1.699              33 cents per mile
$1.70 to $1.899              34 cents per mile
$1.90 to $2.099              35 cents per mile
$2.10 to $2.299              36 cents per mile
Greater than $2.299          36 cents + 1 cent for every 20 cent increase
 
      (3)   When using a private vehicle for county purposes, the employee
assumes liability for the vehicle. All employees who use their personal
vehicles for company business must have a current driver’s license and vehicle
liability insurance in the minimum amounts required by state law. Otherwise,
the vehicle is not authorized for company use.
   (C)   Meal expense.  
      (1)   An employee is eligible for reimbursement for meal expenses while
traveling for the county’s business if the travel requires an absence during
the mealtime hours set forth below and the employee must be in travel status
during the entire mealtime. For example, to be eligible for breakfast
reimbursement, an employee must leave at or before 6:30 a.m. and return at or
after 9:00 a.m. This requirement applies to all meals.
 
                   Authorized Travel Maximum          Maximum Reimbursement
Meal               Times             Reimbursement
                                     (Non-High Rates) (High Rates)
Breakfast          6:30 – 9:00 a.m.$7               $8
Lunch              11:00 – 2:00 p.m$8               $9
Dinner             5:00 – 9:00 p.m.$15              $19
Maximum daily rate Overnight only    $30              $36
 
      (2)   Per-meal limits apply to travel not involving an overnight absence.
If the travel requires the employee to be absent overnight, the maximum daily
amount may be spent in any combination of meals. The list of high-rate areas
recognized by the Kentucky Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet
for state travel expense purposes is used by the county. A copy of the Travel
Expense High Rate Areas is kept in the Judge/Executive’s office.
      (3)   Under no circumstance will employees be reimbursed for the purchase
of any alcohol or tobacco products.
   (D)   Lodging expense.  
      (1)   Employees will be reimbursed for the actual cost of lodging if:
         (a)   The lodging is determined to be the most economical; and
         (b)   A receipt is provided to substantiate the expense.
      (2)   Reimbursement for lodging must not exceed the cost of a single room
rate, except that if employees share lodging, each employee will be reimbursed
the lesser of the single rate or 1/2 the double rate.
   (E)   Miscellaneous expense. Other expenses may be reimbursed subject to
approval by the Fiscal Court. These expenses must be necessary to the
employee’s travel and substantiated by proper receipts.
   (F)   Documentation of expenses. Employees must document business expenses
on a Business Expense Record to receive reimbursement. This document must be
completed by the employee, approved by the Department Head and submitted to the
Finance Officer within 30 days of the incurred expense. Expenses must be
documented with receipts and/or other proof of expenditures attached to the
form. Without this documentation, reimbursement can only be made with explicit
approval by the Fiscal Court.
   (G)   Reimbursements. Reimbursement for expenses are made by check and
normally made within 3 weeks of the completed documents being provided to the
Finance Officer.

§ 36.080 USE OF COUNTY-OWNED OR PERSONAL VEHICLE.
   (A)   During the course of conducting county business, it is often necessary
to be an operator or passenger in a moving vehicle. It shall be the policy of
the Woodford County Fiscal Court that any vehicle (personal or county-owned),
being used to perform service on the county’s behalf, be operated in accordance
with all local, state and federal regulations. This includes but is not limited
to adhering to speed limits (unless an emergency or performance of duties
dictates otherwise), proper use of seat belts and operating the vehicle in a
safe manner. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to
and including transfer of responsibilities not requiring use of a vehicle or
termination of employment.
   (B)   Effective January 1, 2007, any personal use of employer provided
vehicles may be taxable/reportable income. The value of the personal use will
be determined and included in the wages of the employee.
(Order 9, passed 2-10-2004; Am. Order 16, passed 9-12-2006)
§ 36.081 INTERNET USE AND EMAIL POLICY.
   (A)   Introduction.
      (1)   Woodford County Fiscal Court provides its employees with systems to
access the internet and use electronic mail (e-mail) so they can work more
productively. The messages sent and received on the e-mail system, like other
documents created by employees, are the property of Woodford County Fiscal
Court. E-mail should not be used to communicate sensitive or confidential
information. Employees should anticipate that an e-mail message might be
disclosed to or read by individuals other than the intended recipient(s), since
messages can be easily forwarded to other individuals. In addition, while
Woodford County Fiscal Court endeavors to maintain the reliability of its e-
mail system, employees should be aware that a variety of human and system
errors have the potential to cause inadvertent or accidental disclosures of e-
mail messages.
      (2)   This policy explains rules governing the appropriate use of the
internet and e-mail and sets out Woodford County Fiscal Court’s rights to
access messages on the e-mail system.
   (B)   Access to employee e-mail. Employees should not have any expectation
of privacy with respect to messages or files sent, received or stored on
Woodford County Fiscal Court’s e-mail system. Authorized access to employee e-
mail by other employees or outside individuals includes but is not limited to
the following:
      (1)   Access by the systems administration staff during the course of
system maintenance or administration;
      (2)   Access approved by the employee, the employee’s supervisor or
designee of Woodford County Fiscal Court when there is an urgent business
reason to access the employee’s mailbox;
       (3)   Access approved by the employee’s supervisor or designee of
Woodford County Fiscal Court when there is reason to believe the employee is
using e-mail in violation of Woodford County Fiscal Court’s policies; and
      (4)   Access approved by Woodford County Fiscal Court’s human resource
department or County Attorney in response to Woodford County Fiscal Court’s
receipt of a court order or request from law enforcement officials for
disclosure of an employee’s e-mail messages.
   (C)   Employee response to e-mail. Employees must review and respond to all
business-related e- mail messages on a regular basis. In the event an employee
does not have all the information to respond completely, he or she should
acknowledge that he or she has received the message and follow up with complete
information as soon as possible.
   (D)    Passwords. Each user accesses the e-mail system by means of a log-in
name and password.
      (1)   Passwords are intended to keep unauthorized individuals from
accessing messages stored on the system and establish the identity of the
person sending an e-mail message. The failure to keep passwords confidential
can allow unauthorized individuals to read, modify or delete e-mail messages;
circulate e-mail forgeries; and download or manipulate files on other systems.
      (2)   The practice of using passwords should not lead employees to expect
privacy with respect to messages sent or received (see division (B) of this
section).
      (3)   Employees also should not disclose their log-in or password to
anyone, except when required by an urgent business matter (see division (B)(2)
of this section).
   (E)   Personal use. Woodford County Fiscal Court allows incidental personal
use of its e-mail system subject to the following conditions and restrictions:
      (1)   Personal use must be infrequent and must not:
         (a)   Involve any prohibited activity (see division (F) below);
         (b)   Interfere with the productivity of the employee or coworkers;
         (c)   Consume system resources or storage capacity on an ongoing
basis; or
         (d)   Involve large file transfers or otherwise impact or deplete
system resources available for business purposes.
      (2)   Using e-mail to participate in any newsgroup, mailing list,
bulletin board or other type of discussion forum that is not job-related is not
incidental personal use and is strictly prohibited.
      (3)   Employees should not have any expectations of privacy with respect
to personal e-mail sent or received on Woodford County Fiscal Court’s e-mail
system. Employees should delete personal messages as soon as they are read or
replied to. Employees should not store copies of the personal messages they
have sent. Because e-mail is not private, employees should avoid sending
personal messages that are sensitive or confidential.
   (F)   Prohibited activities. Employees are strictly prohibited from using
the internet or e-mail system in connection with any of the following
activities. This list is not all-inclusive, but a sampling of prohibited
activities. Individual situations will be reviewed and investigated on a case-
by-case basis as needed.
      (1)   Engaging in illegal, fraudulent or malicious activities;
      (2)   Transmitting statements, language, images or other materials that
are reasonably likely to be perceived as offensive or disparaging of others
based on race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability,
religious or political beliefs;
      (3)   Downloading, copying or otherwise obtaining music, movies, software
and the like without proper purchase of products;
      (4)   Using abusive or objectionable language in either public or private
messages;
      (5)   Knowingly visiting pornographic or illegal sites, disseminating,
soliciting or storing sexually oriented messages or images;
      (6)   Participating in nonbusiness related activities that will cause
congestion, disruption of networks or systems, including but not limited to
internet games, online gaming, instant messaging and the like;
      (7)   Engaging in activities on behalf of organizations with no
professional affiliation with the Woodford County Fiscal Court;
      (8)   Sending or storing offensive, obscene or defamatory material;
      (9)   Annoying or harassing other individuals;
      (10)   Sending uninvited e-mail of a personal nature;
      (11)   Using another individual’s account or identity without explicit
authorization;
      (12)   Attempting to test, circumvent or defeat security or auditing
systems;
      (13)   Permitting any unauthorized individual to access Woodford County
Fiscal Court’s e-mail system; or
      (14)   Distributing or storing chain letters, jokes, solicitations or
offers to buy or sell goods, or other nonbusiness material of a trivial or
frivolous nature.
   (G)   Confidential information.
      (1)   All employees are expected and required to protect all confidential
information. Confidential information should never be transmitted or forwarded
to outside individuals or companies not authorized to receive the information.
      (2)   Woodford County Fiscal Court also requires its employees to use e-
mail in a way that respects the confidential and proprietary information of
others. Employees are prohibited from copying or distributing copyrighted
material, for example software, database files, documentation or articles,
using the e-mail system.
      (3)   E-mail is an inappropriate method of communicating certain types of
confidential information. Employees should consult their supervisor and the
systems administrator before e-mailing highly sensitive or confidential
information.
   (H)   Storage policy.  All documents created during the course of business
are potentially subject to public access, including e-mail documents. Proper
retention and storage of these documents is governed by the Local Government
Record Retention Schedule issued by the Kentucky Department of Libraries and
Archives. Long-term retention of documents should not be on the electronic e-
mail system; these documents must be printed to paper and stored appropriately.
   (I)   Encryption. Encrypting e-mail messages or attached files sent, stored
or received on Woodford County Fiscal Court’s e-mail system is prohibited
except where explicitly authorized by the court. Employees are prohibited from
using or installing any encryption software without prior permission from the
Woodford County Fiscal Court.
   (J)   Policy violations. Employees violating this policy are subject to
discipline, up to and including termination. Employees using the internet or e-
mail system for defamatory, illegal or fraudulent purposes and employees who
access unauthorized areas of Woodford County Fiscal Court’s computer system
also are subject to civil liability and criminal prosecution.
(Order 9, passed 2-10-2004)
§ 36.082 CELLULAR PHONE, PAGERS, MONITORING DEVICES POLICY.
   This policy outlines the use of personal cell phones, pagers and other
monitoring devices at work, the personal use of business cell phones/pagers,
and the use of cell phones/pagers while traveling.
   (A)   Personal cellular phones/pagers. While at work, an employee is
expected to exercise the same discretion in using personal cellular phones/
pagers as is expected for the use of company phones. Excessive personal phone
calls during the workday, regardless of the phone used, can interfere with
employee productivity and be distracting to others. A reasonable standard the
court encourages is to limit personal calls during work time to an as-needed
basis. Employees are therefore asked to make any other personal calls on
nonwork time where possible and to ensure that friends and family members are
aware of the court’s policy. Flexibility may be provided in circumstances
demanding immediate attention. The court will not be liable for loss of or
damage to personal cellular phones/pagers brought into the workplace.
     (B)   Camera phone or other monitoring devices.  Use of cameras, camera
feature on cellular phones or any other monitoring devices is prohibited in the
workplace. Employees with this type of phone may use the telephone features of
this equipment as per the guidelines listed in division (A) above; however, any
use of the camera feature is grounds for disciplinary action up to and
including termination of employment. Any other type of monitoring device is
strictly prohibited in the workplace.
   (C)   Personal use of court-provided cellular phones/pagers.  
      (1)   The court may issue a business cell phone/pager for work-related
communications. To protect employees from incurring a tax liability for the
personal use of this equipment, the court encourages employees to use these
tools for business reasons only.
      (2)   However, the court recognizes that there may be times that
employees use the phone/pager for intermittent personal use. Employees are
responsible for reviewing the itemized bill for their court- issued account
each month and reimbursing the court at the established rate for all personal
calls that exceed the monthly plan limits. Payments shall be made monthly to
the Treasurer.
      (3)   Cellular phones/pagers remain the property of the court and as
such, the equipment cannot be used for any purpose that contravenes law, public
policy or court policy. Examples of prohibited behavior include but are not
limited to harassing calls and calls made in furtherance of illegal activities.
      (4)   If employees are in possession of a court-issued cellular phone/
pager, they are expected to protect the phone from loss, damage or theft. Upon
resignation or termination of employment, or at any time upon request,
employees may be asked to produce the phone/pager for return or inspection. If
employees are unable to present the phone in good working condition within the
time period requested, they will be expected to bear the cost of a replacement
and be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment.
      (5)   Employees are also responsible for ensuring that their use of
cellular phones gives consideration to the protection of the court’s non-
physical assets. To protect against the misuse of the court-issued cellular
phone account, employees are encouraged to activate key guards and to protect
this telephone number from becoming known by inappropriate individuals. Because
cellular telephone calls can be intercepted, employees are encouraged to use
discretion when discussing court information over any personal or court-issued
cellular phone.
      (6)   If a court-issued cellular phone is capable of accessing the
internet, the employee is responsible for ensuring that any internet access on
his or her account is for a valid business purpose and occurs only when a more
economical alternative is not available within a time frame that meets his or
her business need. When using the court-issued cellular phone for internet
access, the employee remains responsible for the proper use thereof and for the
physical and logical protection of the court’s assets, including the phone and
the court’s information resources.
   (D)   Use of cellular phones while traveling.  
      (1)   If an employee’s job responsibilities include regular or occasional
driving or operating equipment or machinery, and he or she is issued a cell
phone for business use, he or she is expected to refrain from using the phone
while driving or operating equipment or machinery. Safety must come before all
other concerns. Regardless of the circumstances, including slow or stopped
traffic or slow or stopped equipment or machinery operation, employees are
strongly encouraged to pull off to the side of the road and safely stop the
vehicle before placing or accepting a call. If acceptance of a call is
unavoidable and pulling over or stopping operation is not an option, employees
are expected to keep the call short, use the hands-free option if available,
refrain from discussion of complicated or emotional issues, and keep their eyes
on the road and focused on safe equipment or machinery operation. Special care
should be taken in situations where there is traffic, inclement weather or if
employees are driving in an unfamiliar area.
      (2)   If an employee’s job responsibilities do not specifically include
driving as an essential function, but he or she is issued a cell phone for
business use, he or she is also expected to abide by the provisions above while
driving or operating equipment or machinery. The court does not under any
circumstances condone unsafe driving or unsafe operation of machinery.
      (3)   If an employee is charged with a traffic violation resulting from
the use of a cellular phone while driving, he or she will be solely responsible
for all liabilities that result from those actions.
   (E)   Taxation of personal use of county provided cell phone. Effective
January 1, 2007, any personal use of employer provided electronic devices is
taxable/reportable income. The value of the personal use will be determined and

§ 36.083 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   From time to time, differences may arise between employees and
employers. Every attempt should be made by both to resolve these differences on
an informal basis. Employees and supervisors shall work together to resolve any
grievance or dispute.
   (B)   Pending failure of resolution on an informal basis, any grievance or
dispute, which may arise from employment with the county, shall be resolved in
the following manner:
      (1)   Using the grievance initiation form, the employee shall present in
writing the grievance and suggestions as to how the grievance may be resolved
to his or her immediate supervisor within 7 calendar days of its occurrence.
The supervisor or Department Head shall then attempt to adjust the matter and
shall respond to the employee in writing within 7 days of the presentation. A
sample form is referenced in §
36.085.
      (2)   If the grievance remains unadjusted, the employee may then present
it in writing to the Judge/Executive within 7 calendar days after the response
by the supervisor or the Department Head is due. The Judge/Executive should
hear all parties concerned and shall attempt to resolve the grievance. The
Judge/Executive shall respond in writing to the employee within 7 days of the
meeting of the parties.
      (3)   If the grievance remains unresolved, the employee may make a
written request, within 7 days after the response of the Judge/Executive is
due, to meet with the Woodford County Fiscal Court to present the grievance on
the day of the next scheduled court meeting. The Judge/Executive with the
approval of the Fiscal Court shall respond in writing within 10 calendar days
of the Fiscal Court meeting with the employee.
      (4)   The decision of the Judge/Executive with the approval of the Fiscal
Court is final.
      (5)   A copy of all previous written documents involved in the action
shall be attached to the grievance and made a part thereof.
      (6)   All employees are assured there will be no reprisal against any
employee because he or she submitted a grievance. All employees should
recognize that group grievances are impossible to handle in a reasonable way
and therefore will not be accepted.
      (7)   In the event that a grievance is with a Department Head, he or she
may present the written grievance to the Judge/Executive and proceed with
division (B)(2) above and the following steps.

(Order 10, passed 1-22-2008)
§ 36.087 PAID PARENTAL LEAVE POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose/objective. The Woodford County Fiscal Court will provide up to
six weeks of paid parental leave to employees following the birth of an
employee's child or the placement of a child with an employee in connection
with adoption or foster care. The purpose of paid parental leave is to enable
the employee to care for and bond with a newborn or a newly adopted or newly
placed child. This policy will run concurrently with Family and Medical Leave
Act (FMLA) leave, as applicable. This policy will be in effect for births,
adoptions or placements of foster children occurring on or after October 13,
2020.
   (B)   Eligibility.
      (1)   Eligible employees must meet the following criteria:
         (a)   Have been employed with the county for at least 12 months (the
12 months do not need to be consecutive);
         (b)   Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 consecutive
months immediately preceding the date the leave would begin; and
         (c)   Be a full- or part-time regular employee (temporary employees
and interns are not eligible for this benefit).
      (2)   In addition, employees must meet one of the following criteria:
         (a)   Have given birth to a child;
         (b)   Be a spouse or committed partner of a woman who has given birth
to a child; or
         (c)   Have adopted a child or been placed with a foster child age 17
or younger. The adoption of a new spouse's child is excluded from this policy.
   (C)   Amount, timeframe and duration of paid parental leave.
      (1)   Eligible employees will receive a maximum of six weeks of paid
parental leave per birth, adoption, or placement of a child/children. The fact
that a multiple birth, adoption, or placement occurs (e.g., the birth of twins
or adoption of siblings) does not increase the six-week total amount of paid
parental leave granted for that event. In addition, in no case will an employee
receive more than six weeks of paid parental leave in a rolling 12-month
period, regardless of whether more than one birth, adoption or foster care
placement event occurs within that 12-month timeframe.
      (2)   Each week of paid parental leave is compensated at 100% of the
employee's regular, straight-time weekly pay. Paid parental leave will be paid
on a biweekly basis on regularly scheduled pay dates.
      (3)   Employees must take paid parental leave in one continuous period of
leave, and any unused paid parental leave will be forfeited.
      (4)   Upon termination of the individual's employment, he or she will not
be paid for any unused paid parental leave for which he or she was eligible.
   (D)   Coordination with other policies.
      (1)   Paid parental leave taken under this policy will run concurrently
with leave under the FMLA; thus, any leave taken under this policy that falls
under the definition of circumstances qualifying for leave due to the birth or
placement of a child due to adoption or foster care will be counted toward the
12 weeks of available FMLA leave per a 12-month period. All other requirements
and provisions under the FMLA will apply. In no case will the total amount of
leave—whether paid or unpaid—granted to the employee under the FMLA exceed 12
weeks during the 12-month FMLA period. Employees should refer to the Family and
Medical Leave Policy in §
36.069 for further guidance on the FMLA.
      (2)   After the paid parental leave is exhausted, the balance of FMLA
leave (if applicable) will be compensated through employees' accrued sick,
vacation and personal time. Upon exhaustion of accrued sick, vacation and
personal time, any remaining leave will be unpaid leave. Employees should refer
to the Family and Medical Leave Policy in §
36.069 for further guidance on the FMLA.
      (3)   The county will maintain all benefits for employees during the paid
parental leave period just as if they were taking any other county paid leave
such as paid vacation leave or paid sick leave.
      (4)   If a county holiday occurs while the employee is on paid parental
leave, such day will be charged to holiday pay; however, such holiday pay will
not extend the total paid parental leave entitlement.
      (5)   An employee who takes paid parental leave that does not qualify for
FMLA leave will be afforded the same level of job protection for the period of
time that the employee is on paid parental leave as if the employee was on
FMLA-qualifying leave.
   (E)   Requests for paid parental leave.
      (1)   The employee will provide his or her supervisor and the human
resource (HR) department with notice of the request for leave at least 30 days
prior to the proposed date of the leave (or if the leave was not foreseeable,
as soon as possible). The employee must complete the necessary HR forms and
provide all documentation as required by the HR department to substantiate the
request.
      (2)   As is the case with all county policies, the county has the
exclusive right to interpret this policy.

Road Engineer for acceptance by the Woodford County Fiscal Court of the
existing storm water detention/retention areas, which petition must be signed
by 50% or more of all individual lot owners having a maintenance or ownership
interest in and to the storm water detention/retention area, the County Road
Engineer shall prepare a report to the county setting forth his recommendations
regarding whether such subject area should be accepted by the county. In making
his recommendations, the County Road Engineer shall address the following:
      (1)   That 50% or more of all individual lot owners having ownership
control of, or maintenance responsibilities for the subject area have signed
the petition. The County Road Engineer shall be assisted in such determination
by the Woodford County Attorney and the Property Valuation Administrator, who
shall be asked to examine the petition and certify that the necessary
percentage of signatures are located thereon.
      (2)   A deed of conveyance shall be prepared, which shall convey to the
county fee simple ownership in the area, which deed shall be prepared at the
sole cost and expense of those conveying the ownership interest, including
filing fees. In the event that actual ownership of the area is vested by an
undivided interest in and to each lot owner in the subdivision or residential
area, then all such parties shall be required to execute the deed of conveyance
in order that such fee simple ownership is conveyed with good and merchantable
title, which deed shall further contain an acknowledgment that a financial
obligation shall be imposed upon the individual owners in the form of a
maintenance fee imposed by the county, and which shall state that this
obligation shall continue to bind their heirs, successors, and assigns. The
conveyance of deed shall also state that in the event the individual lots or
residential subdivision serviced by the area is annexed by the City of
Versailles, City of Midway, or other municipality, ownership of the area shall
immediately transfer to the municipality annexing; or in the event that the
municipality refuses to accept such transfer, ownership of the area shall then

      (5)   Prior to making his recommendation, the County Road Engineer shall
have inspected the area and shall have determined that same is constructed
properly so that it may be maintained as required, and further, that all
structures located within the area are in good working condition at the time
deed transfer to the county occurs.
   (B)   Acceptance and transfer to the county. Upon transfer by deed to the
county of the area to be maintained, the county shall assume the responsibility
of all maintenance of the area, and the county shall then effectively pro-rate
the cost of the continued maintenance of the area among all individual lot
owners whose lots are located in the vicinity of, and are serviced by, the
storm water detention/retention area. However, rather than bill all of the
individual lot owners, the sum total cost shall be billed annually to the
impacted Home Owners’ Association (HOA), and/or Neighborhood Association (NA).
The HOA or NA shall then remit payment to the county from its association
account, which account is anticipated to have been funded at least in part with
dues or assessments from the lot owners in that particular association
earmarked for this maintenance. The county’s annual fee shall be adjusted each
year to reflect the actual costs incurred by the county for the previous fiscal
year.

negotiate with any individual who has not shown evidence of financial ability
to consummate the purchase or rental of a housing accommodation.

gender identity and sexual orientation;
      (3)   To cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an

familial status, disability, gender identity and sexual orientation; or
   (D)   An employer to give and to act upon the results of any professionally
developed ability test provided that the test, its administration, or action

   (A)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, net profit
shall be apportioned as follows:
         (a)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in
more than 1 tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) of this section, and
the denominator of which is 2; and
         (b)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than 1 tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) of this section.
      (2)   For the purposes of divisions (A) thru (D) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the Occupational
Tax Office.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the county during the tax period by the business
entity for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation
paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the county based on the time the
individual’s service is performed within the county.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the county during the tax period, and
the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sales, lease or rental of tangible personal property is in the
county if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
county regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory or other place of storage in the county and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenue from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the county based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income producing activity within the county and
the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-
producing activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the county, the
business entity may petition the county or the county may require, in respect
to all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any 1 or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of 1 or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the county; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   For the purposes of payroll apportionment, compensation is paid or
payable for work done or services performed or rendered by an employee, both
within and without the county, the license tax shall be measured by that part
of the compensation paid or payable as a result of work done or service
performed or rendered within the county. The license tax shall be computed by
obtaining the percentage which the compensation for work performed or services
rendered within the county bears to the total wages and compensation paid or
payable. In order for the county to verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s
reported percentages under this division, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate
records to establish apportionment. For the purposes of this section, the
employer or employee, as specified in §
111.05 of this chapter, shall file a payroll apportionment form as supplied by
the Occupational Tax Office.

shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter ending
thereafter, on or before the end of the month following the close of each
quarter, make a return and report to the county, and pay to the county, the tax
required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or
required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the county.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the county any sums

fails to withhold or pay over to the county sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld

required to be paid to the county. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
county.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall, annually on or before February 28 of each year, complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the county a reconciliation of the occupational
license tax withheld where compensation is paid or payable to employees. Either

a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the county, shall be submitted.

license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee
for payment to the county during the preceding calendar year.
   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this chapter shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid to one or
more employees of any business entity, and neither the corporate dissolution or
withdrawal of the business entity from the county, nor the cessation of holding
any corporate office, shall discharge that liability of any person; provided
that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each or every person
holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became obligated.
No person shall be personally and individually liable under this division who
had no authority to collect, truthfully account for, or pay over any tax
imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes imposed by this chapter
become or became due.
   (I)   Every employee receiving compensation in the county subject to the tax
imposed under §
111.03 shall be personally liable for the tax, notwithstanding the provisions
of divisions (G) and (H) of this section. In all cases where the employer does
not withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee, such employee
or employees shall be responsible for filing with the county each quarter in
the same manner as if they were the employer. If an employer fails to or is not
required to withhold, report, or pay the license fee it shall become the duty
of the employee to file with the county. The only employer that is not required
to withhold, report and pay the occupational license tax is the federal
government, including the United States Postal Service. The payment required to
be made by an employee, can be made quarterly, for the periods ending March 31,
June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, or at any time the
employee wishes to make an estimated payment for the year in which wages are
earned. All license fees must be received by February 28 for the preceding
calendar year, together with a copy of the employee’s W-2 form. Employers not
required to withhold, report or pay the license fee must annually during the
month of January of each year, make a return to the Occupational Tax
Administrator, in which is set forth the name and social security number of
each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar year, giving the
amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation earned during such
preceding year by each such employee. This list shall include all current full
time employees, part time employees, temporary employees, and terminated
employees, whether it be voluntary or involuntary.
(Ord. 2008-14, passed 7-8-2008)
§ 111.06 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (A)   All business entity returns for the preceding taxable year shall be
made by April 15 of each year, except returns made on the basis of a fiscal
year, which shall be made by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
the close of the fiscal year. Blank forms for returns shall be supplied by the
county.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its
occupational license tax return with the county. Whenever, in the opinion of

business entity in order to audit the return, the county may compel the
business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and
schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed. The county
may also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the federal
government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns and comply with rules as the county from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the county deems it necessary, the county may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath or keep records, as the county deems sufficient to
determine the tax liability the business entity.
   (D)   The county may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the
taxable income of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of
the business entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity, as
appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the county at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return, determined without
regard to any extension of time for filing the return.
   (F)   It shall be the responsibility of persons who make Federal Form 1099
“non-employee compensation” payments to natural persons other than employees
for services performed within the county to maintain records of such payments

manager, operator, or employee related to the establishment in which these
events occurred. In no event is an owner or agent of the premises to forcibly

authority if the person refuses.

fails or refuses to comply with this directive and the owner, manager,
operator, or employee who observed the violation, or if a different person who
directed the person (or persons) in violation to leave the premises, fails to

persons) from the premises, the owner, manager, operator, or employee failing
to take appropriate steps required by this subchapter shall be in violation of
this subchapter.
      (4)   In all events, the establishment in which a violation occurs shall
be in violation of this subchapter for each violation that occurs on its
premises and in connection with which the owner, manager, operator, or employee

      (5)   An employee who observes a person (or persons) violating this
subchapter shall immediately notify his or her owner, manager, or supervisor of
the violation in satisfaction of the employee’s responsibility under this
subchapter. The failure of the employee’s owner, manager, or supervisor to take
appropriate steps required by this subchapter in response to the employee’s
notice shall not constitute a violation on the part of the employee.
      (6)   In the event all duties required under this section are satisfied
yet the person violating this subchapter persists in his or her violation and/
or refuses to vacate the premises on which the violation occurred, the owner,
manager, supervisor, and/or employee shall immediately contact one or more of
the agencies or departments authorized above to enforce this subchapter,
informing the agency or department of the circumstances of the violation.
      (7)   The mere presence of a person smoking within premises of an
establishment governed by this subchapter does not constitute a violation on
the part of the establishment. The establishment and its agents shall only be
charged for a violation of this subchapter if the responsible agent(s) of the
establishment fail to timely satisfy each responsibility prescribed for them in
this section.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, an employee,

   The title of this chapter shall be the Historic Structures Preservation
Ordinance for the county, and shall be cited herein as this chapter.
(Ord. 1-99, passed 2-23-1999)
§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BUILDING. In addition to its ordinary meaning, any structure constructed or
used for residence, business, industry, government, education, religion,
entertainment or other public or private purposes, or accessory thereto.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any building or structure situated on real property in
any historic district, and a landmark or other site, building, structure or
other object included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places maintained by the Secretary of the Interior under the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.
   STRUCTURE. In addition to its ordinary meaning, anything constructed or
made, the use of which requires permanent location in or on the ground or
attachment to something having a permanent location, in or on the ground,
including but not limited to buildings, signs and rock fences.
(Ord. 1-99, passed 2-23-1999)
§ 151.03 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   The Woodford County Fiscal Court finds that many structures and
improvements having a distinctive character or special historic, aesthetic,
architectural or cultural interest or value have been irrevocably altered,
modified, demolished or uprooted, notwithstanding the feasibility and
desirability of preserving and continuing the use and existence of these
structures and improvements, and without adequate consideration of the
irreplaceable loss to the people of the county. In addition, distinctive or
historic neighborhoods, areas, places and archaeological sites have been and
may be similarly uprooted or may have their distinctiveness destroyed, although
the preservation thereof may be both feasible and desirable. It is the finding
of the Woodford County Fiscal Court that the distinctive character of this
county can only be maintained and enhanced by respecting its historic,
aesthetic, architectural, archaeological and cultural heritage, and by
preventing the destruction of these civic and community assets.
   (B)   The Woodford County Fiscal Court hereby declares as a matter of public
policy that the preservation, protection, perpetuation and use of
neighborhoods, areas, places, structures and improvements having a special or
distinctive character or a special historic, aesthetic, architectural,
archaeological or cultural interest or value, and which serve as visible
reminders of the history and heritage of this county, Commonwealth or nation is
a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity,
safety, welfare and economic well-being of the people.
   (C)   The purpose of this chapter is to effect the goals as set forth in the
above findings and declaration of public policy and specifically, but not
exclusively, to:
      (1)   Effect and accomplish the preservation, protection, perpetuation
and use of historic landmarks, landmark sites and neighborhoods, areas, places,
structures and improvements having a special or distinctive character or a
special historic, aesthetic, architectural, archaeological or cultural interest
or value to this county, Commonwealth or nation;
      (2)   Promote the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of
the people and safeguard the county’s history and heritage as embodied and
reflected in the landmarks, sites and districts;
      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values in those districts and in
this county as a whole;
      (4)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable accomplishments;
      (5)   Strengthen the economy of this county;
      (6)   Protect and enhance this county’s attractions to residents,
tourists and visitors and serve as a support and stimulus to business and
industry; and
      (7)   Enhance the visual and aesthetic character, diversity and
distinctiveness of the county.
(Ord. 1-99, passed 2-23-1999)
§ 151.04 DESIGNATION AS HISTORIC STRUCTURE.
   (A)   Any landowner in the county shall be entitled to have his or her
property or building or structure thereon designated as an historic structure,
which location shall be identified by description and research data, setting
forth the address, boundaries and general nature and characteristics, and filed
with the Clerk of the Fiscal Court on a form and in a manner approved by the
Fiscal Court.
   (B)   In considering the designation of any landmark, the Fiscal Court shall
apply the following criteria with respect to that property; provided, however,
that no neighborhood, area, site, place, structure or improvement shall be
required to satisfy more than 1 of these criteria to qualify for the
designation:
      (1)   Its character, interest or value as part of the development or
heritage of the county, the Commonwealth or the United States;
      (2)   Its exemplification of the historic, aesthetic, architectural,
archaeological, educational, economic or cultural heritage of the county, the
Commonwealth or the United States;
      (3)   Its location as a site of a significant historic event;
      (4)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the culture and development of the county, the Commonwealth or
the United States;
      (5)   Its embodiment of distinguishing architectural characteristics;
      (6)   Its identification as the work of a locally or nationally
recognized architect or master builder;
      (7)   Its embodiment of elements of architectural design, detail,
materials or craftsmanship which represent a significant architectural
innovation; or
      (8)   Its unique location, significance, physical characteristics,
significant architectural or historic characteristics, representing a
neighborhood or district within the county or representing an established or
familiar visual feature within a neighborhood or district in the county.
(Ord. 1-99, passed 2-23-1999)
§ 151.05 FISCAL COURT ACTION.
   (A)   Within 21 days after making the designation as provided for in §
151.04 above, the Clerk of the Fiscal Court shall present the request to the
full Fiscal Court. To be effective, any designation application must be
confirmed by the Fiscal Court. Any designation not brought to a vote of Fiscal
Court within 90 days after application submission shall be deemed confirmed.
The Fiscal Court shall notify the owner(s) of the affected property of the
designation. Any aggrieved applicant shall have an appeal to Woodford Circuit
Court of any final designation by Fiscal Court by filing an action therein
within 30 days of the Fiscal Court vote on the matter. After submission of
application, and pending Fiscal Court review and approval, no building,
wrecking, grading or other permits shall be issued by any government agent or
agency.
   (B)   Upon the confirmation of a designation as historic structure by Fiscal
Court, the requesting landowner shall record notice of the designation with the
Woodford County Clerk’s Office, at the landowner’s expense.
   (C)   The Fiscal Court, after application and prior to exercising its
authority to designate buildings or structures as historic structures, shall
first obtain the voluntary written consent of the owner of the building or
structure, and only after advising the owner, in writing, of any advantages and
disadvantages to the owner which are likely to result from the exercise of that
authority, in a form and manner to be prescribed and approved by the Fiscal
Court. Failure of the applicant to consent in this regard shall toll the 90-day
period for Fiscal Court action by a period equal to the number of days it takes
for the applicant to respond.
(Ord. 1-99, passed 2-23-1999)
§ 151.06 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
   (A)   Every person in charge of an historic structure shall keep in good
repair:
      (1)   All of the exterior portions of the improvements; and
      (2)   All interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may
cause or tend to cause the exterior portions of the improvements to
deteriorate, decay or become damaged, or otherwise to fall into a state of
disrepair.
   (B)   The provisions of this section shall be in addition to all other
provisions of law requiring the improvements to be kept in good repair.
(Ord. 1-99, passed 2-23-1999)
§ 151.07 DEMOLITION PROHIBITED.
   No person shall be permitted to disturb, demolish, destroy, reconstruct or
otherwise affect historic structures. No public or private utility, attempting
to take property under the law of eminent domain, shall be permitted to
disturb, demolish, destroy, reconstruct or otherwise affect historic structures
without first obtaining necessary grading, wrecking and/or other appropriate
permits from the Woodford County Planning Commission. If the Planning
Commission rejects the permit request of the private or public utility, then
the Public Service Commission may override the decision of the Planning
Commission and issue a certificate of convenience and necessity for the
requested permit(s), if it determines that there is no acceptable alternate
site and that the public convenience and necessity requires the proposed
construction, which determination must be more than conclusory in nature, and
which must be supported by reliable and verifiable documentation, research and/
or studies and analysis. In a case involving water lines, regulation of the
size and dimension of water lines shall remain within the jurisdiction of the
Planning Commission and/or Fiscal Court. Provided, however, that the terms of
this provision shall not bind or apply to Woodford County Government or to any
of its agencies or districts, or to the Federal Highway Administration,
Kentucky Department of Transportation or other similar government agency.
(Ord. 1-99, passed 2-23-1999) Penalty see § 151.99
§ 151.08 RELEASE OF DETERMINATION.
   The decision of any landowner opting to have his or her property determined
to be an historic structure under this chapter may be withdrawn only by a
successor titleholder to the real property upon which the historic structure(s)
rest. The successor titleholder shall file a release of determination with the
Woodford County Court Clerk, at his or her expense, to void any historic
structure determination.
(Ord. 1-99, passed 2-23-1999; Am. Ord. 3-99, passed 4-13-1999)

§ 154. 47 PURCHASE OF CONSERVATION EASEMENTS.
   If the application is complete and the minimum criteria established in §
154.45 are met, the application shall be evaluated and scored by the Woodford
County Rural Land Board. However, if WRLB is working with an accredited land
trust, the evaluation criteria of the accredited land trust must supersede
those presented herein.
   (A)   Area of parcel (12 possible points plus 15 potential bonus points).
The purpose of this criterion is to assist in building a critical mass of
agricultural land. These points shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Basic.
 
Over 350 acres (12 points)
251-350 acres  (10 points)
121 -250 acres (8 points)
41-120 acres   (6 points)
21-40 acres    (2 points)
10-20 acres    (1 point)
 
      (2)   Bonus. Additional points will be assigned to parcels of 30 or more
acres if the landowner agrees not to subdivide the parcel and build residences
on those parcels. The property owner shall receive 1 bonus point for each right
to develop a 1-acre tract which is extinguished up to a maximum of 15 bonus
points.
   (B)   Length of public road frontage (5 possible points). The purpose of
this criterion is to encourage the preservation of parcels with significant
road frontage. These points shall be calculated as follows:
 
1,001 feet+         (5 points)
501 feet-1,000 feet (3 points)
300 feet-500 feet   (1 point)
 
   (C)   Proximity and/or “batch” application (15 possible points). The purpose
of this criterion is to encourage the protection of large contiguous blocks of
rural land. Distances shall be measured from the parcel’s boundary lines and
the points from division (C)(2) of this section (part of “batch application”)
are in addition to any points from division (C)(1) of this section (proximity
to another property protected with conservation easement). These points shall
be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Proximity.
 
Adjacent         10 points
Within 1/2 Mile  5 points
Within 1 Mile    3 points
More than 1 Mile 0 points
 
      (2)   Batch application. The purpose of this criterion is to encourage
landowners of contiguous parcels pursuant to §
154.02 to apply to the program as a joint batch application pursuant to §
154.02. Each application submitted as a “batch application” will be
individually evaluated and the batch will be given 5 additional points for
being part of a batch application.
   (D)   Quality of soils (30 possible points). The purpose of this criterion
is to examine the quality of soils on the property for agriculture. Soil
information will be provided by the landowner in the application and verified
by the Woodford County Rural Land Board with the assistance of the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The NRCS maps will be the basis to
decide this question. These points shall be calculated as follows:
 
At least 80% prime farmland                                     30 points
At least 70% prime farmland                                     25 points
At least 60% prime farmland                                     20 points
At least 50% prime farmland                                     15 points
At least 50% statewide important                                10 points
At least 25% prime farmland & less than 50% statewide important 5 points
 
   (E)   Farm activity (5 possible points). The purpose of this criterion is to
evaluate whether the parcel is actively farmed. In evaluating whether the
parcel is actively farmed, consideration will be given to the percentage of
cropland and/or pasture land of the property as well as agricultural activities
pursuant to §
154.02. These points shall be calculated as follows:
 
Actively farmed more than 5 of last 10 years 5 points
 
   (F)   Environmentally sensitive areas (10 possible points). The purpose of
this criterion is to protect environmentally sensitive areas. If the parcel
includes environmentally sensitive areas (ESA) as determined by data produced
by the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS), Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), the most recently adopted Versailles-Midway-Woodford County zoning
ordinance, and the most recently adopted comprehensive plan, it will receive up
to 5 points. These points shall be calculated as follows:
 
At least 50% environmentally sensitive areas 10 points
At least 25% environmentally sensitive areas 5 points
 
   (G)   Designated rural greenways (5 possible points). The purpose of this
criterion is to protect designated rural greenways. If any part of the parcel
is located within one of the rural greenways, as determined by the most
recently adopted comprehensive plan, it will receive 5 points.
   (H)   Designated focus areas (10 possible points). The purpose of this
criterion is to protect the designated focus areas, as determined by the most
recently adopted comprehensive plan and Rural Land Board. If any part of the
parcel is located within one of the focus areas, the application receives 10
points.
   (I)   Natural protection areas (10 possible points).
      (1)   The purpose of this criterion is to protect the special natural
protection areas. These points shall be calculated as follows:
         (a)   Parcel is included in “A” list of special natural (10 points)
protection areas provided by data from The Kentucky Division of Forestry, The
Nature Conservancy, and in the most recently adopted comprehensive plan.
         (b)   Parcel is included in “B” list of special natural (5 points)
protection areas provided by data from The Kentucky Division of Forestry, The
Nature Conservancy and the most recently adopted comprehensive plan.
      (2)   Alternatively, applicants will be eligible to demonstrate the
parcel contains special natural protection areas not identified in the most
recently adopted comprehensive plan. The landowner who indicates on the
applicant’s application that the property includes rare or unusual flora or
fauna, special indigenous plant sites, wildlife habitat or provides wildlife
ecosystem linkages necessary to ensure biodiversity will need to provide
background information relating to the existence of these resources on the
property. The existence of these items should be independently verified by the
Woodford County Rural Land Board or a state conservation agency or an
independent non-profit conservation organization such as The Nature
Conservancy. If the landowner can document that the parcel includes special
natural protection areas not identified in the most recently adopted
comprehensive plan, the application would receive points, not to exceed 10, due
to this inclusion.
   (J)   Linkages (4 possible points). The purpose of this criterion is to
protect linkages within the rural areas. This criterion examines whether the
parcel is located near or has the ability to be linked to parks, nature
preserves, nature sanctuaries, historic sites or other lands that have been
specifically designated for long term natural resource use, conservation or
preservation purposes. Distance is measured from parcel boundaries. These
points shall be calculated as follows:
 
Contiguous or provide direct linkage 4 points
Within 1/2 mile or provide a buffer  2 points
Within 1 mile                        1 point
 
   (K)   Historic/cultural resources (11 possible points). The purpose of this
criterion is to protect the historic/cultural resources of the rural area.
Points in divisions (3) through (5) are in addition to any points accumulated
from division (1) or (2), and shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   If any part of the property is listed in the National Register of
Historic Places, or is designated a locally designated historic district or
landmark, it would receive 3 points, or if the property is determined eligible
for the National Register, it would receive 2 points.
      (2)   If any part of the property is located in a National Register
Historic District, or is located in the Old Historic District (OH) or a locally
designated historic district, it would receive 2 additional points.
      (3)   If the property includes stone fences, the property would receive 2
additional points. A minimum of 100 linear feet of stone fence is necessary.
      (4)   If any part of the property is designated as a national Historic
Landmark, it would receive 2 additional points.
      (5)   If the property contains any registered or significant
archeological sites, it would receive 2 additional points.
   (L)   Scenic resources (11 possible maximum points). The purpose of this
criterion is to protect the scenic resources of the rural area. Points in
divisions (4) through (6) are in addition to any points accumulated from
divisions (1), (2) or (3).
      (1)   If the property is located on one of the Heritage Preservation
Districts or other scenic rural roads identified in the most recently adopted
comprehensive plan, the property would receive 2 points;
      (2)   If the property is located on a local/state designated scenic or
historic byway or highway, it would receive 3 points; or
      (3)   If the property is located on a federally designated scenic or
historic byway or highway, it would receive 5 points.
      (4)   If the property is adjacent to I-64 or Bluegrass Parkway and/or is
part of the scenic viewshed visible from I-64 or Bluegrass Parkway, it would
receive 2 additional points.
      (5)   If the property is part of the scenic viewshed visible from
publicly owned land such as parks, nature preserves, sanctuaries, historic
sites, the property would receive 2 additional points.
      (6)   If the property contains other scenic features, such as tree-lined
canopy, or significant view sheds, it would receive 2 additional points. The
scenic features of the property must be documented and independently verified.
   (M)   Elimination of undeveloped nonconforming tracts (15 possible points).
The purpose of this criterion is to encourage consolidation/elimination of
nonconforming tracts of less than 30 acres. Such tracts may be part of a
platted property or part of a larger parcel. For each nonconforming tract of
less than 30 acres which is consolidated/eliminated, add 1 point up to maximum
of 15 points.
   (N)   Urban service area boundary (15 possible points). The following point
additions shall be applied in the following cases:
      (1)   If the property is contiguous or within 1/2 mile to the existing
urban service area boundary, add 5 points.
      (2)   If the property is between 1/2 mile and 1 mile of the existing
urban service boundary, add 10 points.
      (3)   If the property is more than 1 mile from the existing urban service
boundary, add 15 points.

parcel of eligible land and a written report shall be made to the Woodford
County Rural Land Board prioritizing the applications according to the
selection criteria established pursuant to §
154.45.
   (B)   The Woodford County Rural Land Board may, by majority vote of those
voting members present, determine to hear appeals from those landowners who are
dissatisfied either with determinations of the Woodford County Rural Land Board
as to their eligibility pursuant to §
154.45, or as to the evaluation and scoring of their application pursuant to §
154.46. The Board shall determine by majority vote of those voting members
present:
      (1)   How appeals will be heard, unless it has adopted a specific bylaw
or regulation to govern those proceedings; and
      (2)   Whether remedial action will be taken.
   (C)   After consideration of the written report of the Woodford County Rural
Land Board, as well as the inspections of the parcels of land and the
determinations made on appeals, if any, the Woodford County Rural Land Board
shall upon a vote of 7 voting members determine which landowners the Woodford
County Rural Land Board shall submit to an accredited land trust to begin
negotiations for purchase of a conservation easement. This determination shall
be made in accordance with the goal of purchasing conservation easements from
as many rural landowners as possible in order to accumulate a critical mass of
land to be retained in the future for agricultural, rural and natural lands
preservation and management purposes, without overlooking the future urban
needs of the community. The Board shall not be required to purchase
conservation easements in the exact order of priority of applications as
determined by the selection criteria established pursuant to §
154.45, so long as it proceeds in compliance with this section, pursues the
purchase of highest priority conservation easements first, gives due
consideration to each application, and gives consideration to all of the goals
of the most recently adopted comprehensive plan.

§ 154.50 APPRAISAL.
   (A)   If the Woodford County Rural Land Board or an accredited land trust
and the landowner reach an agreement as to the terms of the proposed deed of
easement, the Board shall secure an appraisal to determine the conservation
easement value. The Board may confer this responsibility to an accredited land
trust and contribute to the cost of the appraisal. The cost of the appraisal
shall be paid for from funds held by the Woodford County Rural Land Board and/
or the accredited land trust with whom the Board is partnering and the
methodology shall be determined by the Board in accordance with the following:
      (1)   The appraisal shall be conducted per the requirements of the IRS
and/or relevant federal or state funding agencies by a certified real estate
appraiser who is qualified to appraise property for easement purchase. The
appraisal shall to the extent possible be based on an analysis of comparable
sales.
      (2)   The appraisal shall include, at a minimum, a legal description of
the appraised parcel of land, description of improvements, photos of the parcel
of land, color aerial photos of the subject parcel of land (photos may be
Woodford County GIS based), pertinent data for each comparable sale, any
attributes which limit the development of the parcel of land, and a description
of the area or neighborhood in which the parcel of land is located.
      (3)   The appraisal shall contain an analysis of the highest and best use
of the parcel of land, the valuation methodology used by the appraiser to

§ 154.51 PURCHASE.
   (A)   The WRLB may partner with an accredited land trust to purchase
conservation easements in Woodford County.
   (B)   After receipt of all information relating to an application, the
Woodford County Rural Land Board may, upon a vote of 7 voting members,
authorize the partnering accredited land trust to enter into a contract of sale
with a landowner for purchase of a conservation easement on a parcel of land at
a specified price.
   (C)   Reserved.
   (D)   The Woodford County Rural Land Board will reserve the right to freeze
available funds until the application qualifies for matching funding from other
sources.
   (E)   Rescission rule. A waiting period of 30 days will be provided to each
applicant upon contract approval. The purpose of the waiting period is to
assure that the landowner fully understands the rules of the easement purchase.
During this 30-day waiting period, the landowner can remove their property from
further consideration by the Woodford County Rural Land Board or the partner
accredited land trust. Once the waiting period has expired, the deed will be
signed by the appropriate parties, the monies for easement purchase will be
provided to the landowner, and the conservation easement will be recorded. In
the event a landowner opts out of the easement purchase, certain expenditures
by the accredited land trust and/or the Woodford County Rural Land Board should
be repaid by the landowner. These expenditures include but are not limited to
any appraisal fees, attorney fees, and other incurred expenses of the
accredited land trust and/or the Woodford County Rural Land Board.
(Ord. 2009-06, passed 7-14-2009; Am. Ord. 2023-05, passed 5-23-2023)
§ 154.52 RECORDING.
   (A)   The purchase price may be paid for from funds held by the Woodford
County Rural Land Board, the federal government, the state, other nonprofits,
private donations and/or the accredited land trust. Prior to closing, a title
search shall be completed by an attorney approved by the accredited land trust
and/or the Woodford County Rural Land Board which determines that the landowner
has clear, marketable, fee simple title to the parcel of land. The landowner
shall execute a deed which shall be recorded by the attorney.
   (B)   A conservation easement may also be acquired by an exchange of the
interest which the government owns in other than eligible lands for eligible
lands, upon approval by the Woodford County Fiscal Court.
   (C)   Within 10 working days of recording the conservation easement, the
Woodford County Rural Land Board shall notify the divisions of planning,
building inspection, GIS, engineering and historic preservation; the department
of finance; and other appropriate government offices, of the conservation
easement acquisition.
   (D)   Any applications which fulfill the criteria set forth in this chapter
and in the regulations adopted by the Woodford County Rural Land Board, but
which are not offered a contract to purchase because available funds are not
sufficient within the current fiscal year, shall be considered in the next
application cycle, provided that the landowner updates the information on the
application. These applications shall not be given any preference or priority
at that time, but will be considered under the terms and conditions of this
chapter along with all other applications submitted at that time. However,
payment of a new application fee shall not be required.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 154.65 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any of the enforcement rights in this section may be assigned to a
partnering accredited land trust. The Woodford County Rural Land Board shall
promptly investigate all complaints of violation of Conservation Easements.
Additionally, the Woodford County Rural Land Board shall use its best efforts
to prevent violations by inspecting the land and structures to which each
conservation easement applies at least once annually in order to ascertain
whether the landowner is complying with all of the conditions of the deed of
conservation easement and this chapter. In the case of any investigation or
inspection, the Woodford County Rural Land Board shall record all findings and
actions in the official records. If the Woodford County Rural Land Board finds
that the provisions of any conservation easement are being or have been
violated, an order may be issued on behalf of the Woodford County Rural Land
Board to require that the landowner take the action necessary to correct the
violation.
   (B)   If an order of the Woodford County Rural Land Board is disregarded,
the County Attorney may seek by appropriate proceedings an injunction against
any threatened construction or other development or activity on the parcel of
land which would violate the conservation easement, and in such event, he/she
shall seek a mandatory injunction requiring the removal of any structure
erected in violation of a conservation easement and the restoration of the land
and structures to their original character as of the effective date of the
conservation easement, insofar as possible. If an injunction is sought, the
County Attorney shall also seek to recover the costs of any successful
enforcement proceeding and damages, if appropriate, and pursuant to the terms
of the conservation easement record a lien against the property until paid.
   (C)   After a conservation easement has been acquired by the Woodford County
Rural Land Board, an agency and instrumentality of the Woodford County Fiscal
Court, whether by purchase or donation, no building permit shall be issued for
any structure or any certificate of occupancy for any use, which would violate
the terms of the conservation easement.
(Ord. 2009-06, passed 7-14-2009; Am. Ord. 2023-05, passed 5-23-2023)
§ 154.66 RELEASE.
   All conservation easements or other interests in land which are purchased
pursuant to this chapter shall be perpetual, unless released by a court of
competent jurisdiction after it is determined that it has become impossible to
fulfill any of the conservation purposes of the easement, as such process is
detailed in the conservation agreement.
(Ord. 2009-06, passed 7-14-2009; Am. Ord. 2023-05, passed 5-23-2023)
§ 154.67 PLANNING COMMISSION DUTIES.
   (A)   During every 5-year update of the comprehensive plan, and at any other
time that the Planning Commission reviews the location of the urban service
boundary, the Planning Commission shall consider the following matters with
regard to the inclusion within the urban service boundary of any property for
which a conservation easement or other interests in land designed to preserve
and manage agricultural, rural and natural lands has been purchased or donated:
      (1)   Whether the inclusion of the property within the urban service
boundary is consistent with the goals of the most recently adopted
comprehensive plan;
      (2)   Whether the inclusion of the property in the urban service boundary
is in the public interest because development of the property is necessary to
accommodate growth and to encourage development in a more contiguous pattern
than might otherwise occur; and
      (3)   Whether inclusion of the property in the urban service boundary is
likely to have an adverse impact upon other properties from which a
conservation easement has been purchased under the program or upon surrounding
farmland.
   (B)   In reviewing these issues, the Planning Commission shall consult with
and receive recommendations from the Woodford County Rural Land Board and other
entities holding interests in land designed to preserve and manage
agricultural, rural and natural lands.
