is repealed at the same or at a subsequent session of the Council as long as
the repealing act takes effect prior to the effective date of the original
amendment.

shall have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or
amendment as the case may be.

MOTIONS
§ 31.35 PROGRESS OF A MOTION.
   (A)   A member seeks recognition by addressing the Chairperson. The
Chairperson should be addressed by the appropriate title: Mayor; Mister or
Madame Chairperson; or Mister and Madame President; whichever is appropriate.
   (B)   The Presiding Officer recognizes the City Council member by his or her
name, "Council member Smith" or by a nod to the member. The person recognized
has the floor and is the only member entitled to speak.
   (C)   The Council member proposes a motion. "I move that..."
   (D)   Another member seconds the motion. If no member seconds the motion,
the Chairperson may declare the motion lost for lack of second.
   (E)   The Chairperson states the motion to the Council. After it has been
stated to the Council, it may be referred to as the question, proposition or
measure.
   (F)   (1)   The Council discusses or debates the motion. If more than one
member desires to speak to the motion and seeks the floor, certain principles
guide the decision of the Chairperson. Preference should be given to the
proposer of the motion. A member who has not spoken to the motion should be
given preference over a member who has.
      (2)   The Chairperson should alternate recognition to those who favor the
question with those who oppose it, if he or she knows the opinions of the
various members. The Chairperson should recognize a member who seldom speaks in
preference to one who speaks often.
   (G)   The Chairperson calls for a vote on the motion. He or she may, before
taking the vote, ask if there is any further discussion. A vote is taken by the
Chairperson announcing, "All in favor of the motion say aye". Following the
affirmative vote, the Chairperson then says, "Those opposed, say no". If the
Chairperson cannot determine the number of voices votes, he or she may ask the
members of the Council to vote by a show of hands. However, the final vote on
an ordinance, must be recorded call vote. A roll call vote is taken by the
Chairperson or Clerk calling the name of each Council member present.
   (H)   The Chairperson announces the result of the vote: "The motion is
carried" or "the motion is lost".

§ 33.189 HEARING; NOTICE; FINAL ORDER.
   (A)   When a hearing has been requested, the Code of Ordinance Enforcement
Board shall schedule a hearing.
   (B)   Not less than seven calendar days before the date of the hearing, the
Code of Ordinance Enforcement Board, through the Hopkinsville Fire Department,
shall notify the requester of the date, time and place of the hearing. The
notice may be given by regular first-class mail; certified mail, return receipt
requested; by personal delivery; or by leaving the notice at the person’s usual
place of residence with any individual residing therein who is 18 years of age
and who is informed of the contents of the notice.
   (C)   (1)   Any person requesting a hearing before the Code of Ordinance
Enforcement Board who fails to appear at the time and place set for the hearing
shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing to contest the citation
and the determination that a violation was committed shall be final. In this
event, the citation as issued shall be deemed a final order determining the
violation was committed and imposing the civil fine set forth in the citation,
and the alleged violator shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the
final order to District Court.
      (2)   Notice of the final order shall be provided by the cited violator
by regular first-class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; personal
delivery; or by leaving the notice at the person’s usual place of residence
with any individual residing therein who is 18 years of age or older and who is
informed of the contents of the notice.
   (D)   All testimony at the hearing shall be taken under oath and recorded.
Testimony shall be taken from the Code Enforcement Officer, the alleged
violator and any witnesses to the violation offered by the Code Enforcement
Officer or alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but
fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings.
   (E)   At the hearing, the Code of Ordinance Enforcement Board shall, based
on the evidence, determine whether a violation was committed. If it determines
no violation was committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered.
If it determines a violation was committed, an order shall be issued upholding
the citation and the Code of Ordinance Enforcement Board shall order the
offender to pay a civil fine in an amount up to the maximum authorized by
ordinance, and may order the offender to remedy a continuing violation within a
specified time.
   (F)   With regard to any hearing concerning an unsafe structure, the Code of
Ordinance Enforcement Board, as part of its decision and written order, in
addition to the fines set forth in division (E) above, may additionally make
provision for the offender to cure the violation. Said provision shall not
exceed 90 days unless special conditions exist, such as insurance settlement or
pending litigation involving the property. In the event such a provision is
ordered, the order shall provide that the owner or responsible person is
required to:
      (1)   Cure the violation within the time period set forth in the order
pursuant to the standards set forth herein;
      (2)   Submit a work write-up to the enforcement officer within 45 days of
the order, which shall include a detailed description of the proposed
improvements to the real estate to cure the violation;
      (3)   Obtain the enforcement officer's approval of the work write-up
before commencing to improve the real estate;
      (4)   Obtain a building permit from the city before making any
improvements to a structure;
      (5)   Prohibit the installation or hook up of any permanent utilities
until final approval is obtained from the enforcement officer;
      (6)   Prohibit any person from occupying the real estate in violation
until final approval is obtained from the enforcement officer; and
      (7)   Obtain the enforcement officer's final approval of the completed
improvements and of the curing of the violation within the time period
established in the order.
   (G)   If the owner or responsible person of an unsafe structure in violation
of this chapter fails to properly cure or remedy the violation within seven
days following entry of an order by the Code of Ordinance Enforcement Board
upholding a citation, or within the period to cure as otherwise provided by
order of the Code of Ordinance Enforcement Board, whichever is later, then the
city, in its discretion and without obligation, may enter upon the real estate
and take such action as it deems appropriate to cure the violation and abate
the nuisance. The action may include the cutting or removing of grass and
weeds, the removal of trash, debris, garbage, refuse, materials, waste, junk,
litter and other matter constituting a violation, the repair of any unsafe or
unsanitary condition and the demolition and removal of any unsafe structure.
   (H)   Every final order of the Code of Ordinance Enforcement Board shall be
reduced to writing, which shall include the findings of fact and conclusions of
law reached and the date the order was issued. A copy shall be furnished to the
person named in the citation. If the person named in the citation is not
present when the final order is issued, the order shall be delivered by regular
first-class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; personal delivery;
or by leaving the notice at the person’s usual place of residence with any
individual residing therein who is 18 years of age or older and who is informed
of the contents of the notice.

   (A)   If any penalties, abatement costs, or fees remain unpaid, the city
shall possess a lien on property owned by the person found by a final non-
appealable order as defined by KRS 65.8805(8) or by a final judgment of the
court to have committed a violation of a city ordinance for all fines assessed
for the violation and for all charges, attorney fees, and any other fees
incurred by the city in connection with enforcement of the ordinance, including

prima facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the regularity of the
proceedings pursuant to KRS 65.8801 to 65.8839.
   (B)   The lien shall be recorded in the office of the Christian County
Clerk. The lien shall be notice to all persons from the time of its recording
and shall bear interest until paid at the rate allowed by law.
   (C)   Subject to KRS 65.8836, the lien shall take precedence over all other
liens, except state, county, school board and city taxes; shall continue for
ten years following the date of the nonappealable final order, or final
judgment of the court; and may be enforced by judicial proceedings, including
an action to foreclose.
   (D)   In addition to the remedy prescribed in division (A) above, the person
found to have committed the violation shall be personally responsible for the
amount of the lien, including all civil fines assessed for the violation and
for all charges, fees, and abatement costs incurred by the city in connection
with the enforcement of the ordinance. The city may bring a civil action
against the person and shall have the same remedies as provided for the
recovery of a debt.

DUTIES, GOALS, CAPABILITIES OF PREPARING A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND AIDING IN ITS
IMPLEMENTATION
 
        The Planning Commission, created by local ordinances, is made up of
        appointed citizens. However, all are to serve the interests of the entire
Duties: citizenry of our communities. As a tool to be referenced in their decision
        making process, the community's Comprehensive Plan serves as “the general
        plan of the community which states its official statement of major policies
        concerning desirable future physical development.”
        Therefore, it should be the goal of the Planning Commission to act as a
Goals:  conduit for the citizens, and to aid in the desirable future physical
        development of our communities.
 
 
                                     It shall be the job of the staff to
                                     provide the necessary technical guidance
                                     needed by the Commission to weigh its
                                     decisions based upon both the community's
Capabilities of Preparing the        objectives, reflected in a Comprehensive
Comprehensive Plan:                  Plan, and the proposal being considered.
                                     Therefore, as a support staff, it should
                                     be their job to research and offer
                                     recommendation, not to misdirect or take
                                     the lead on issues opposing the
                                     community's major goals and objectives.
                                     The job is not over once the Plan is
                                     prepared, reviewed and amended by both
                                     citizen and legislative bodies; it is just
                                     the beginning.
                                     It now becomes the job of the entire
                                     community to transform the plans into
                                     reality; into bricks and mortar. The
                                     degree to which these plans become real
                                     can be measured by the participation and
Aiding in the Comprehensive Plan’s continued interest shown by our total
Implementation:                      community.
                                     Government, and its public agencies, can
                                     take the lead in implementation of the
                                     Plan through adoption, referral, capital
                                     improvement programming, and Plan
                                     updating.
                                     However, it takes a unique combination of
                                     public/private cooperation to make the
                                     plan real in our communities. Without
                                     private, self-imposed actions to see to it
                                     that the Plan is followed, we will fail.

   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts;
   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of the city depends upon
the public's confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers
and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the private
interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled; and
   (C)   The government of the city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
(Ord. 30-94, passed 12-20-1994)
§ 36.03 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring that
standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for officers
and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in their
application and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
KRS 65.003, as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly and any amendments
made subsequent to that date.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

the contract is awarded after public notice and competitive bidding, unless the
officer or employee is authorized to participate in establishing the contract
specifications, awarding the contract, or managing the contract performance

the same time, whether in the same or a different city.
   (B)   Pursuant to KRS 61.080, no city officer may also hold a county office.
In addition, the statute also states that the following city and consolidated
local government offices are incompatible with any other public office:
      (1)   Member of the legislative body of cities of the first class;
      (2)   Mayor and member of the legislative council of a consolidated local
government; and
      (3)   Mayor and member of the legislative body in cities of the home rule
class.
   (C)   In addition to the Constitution and statutory provisions, there are
common law incompatibilities that have been defined by the courts. City
officers and employment positions are deemed incompatible when one office or
position of employment was inherently inconsistent in function with the other
when there arises an implication that the duties and responsibilities of both
cannot be performed at the same time with a necessary degree of impartiality
and honesty.
   (D)   KRS 61.090 provides that the acceptance of an incompatible office
operates to vacate the first office.

§ 36.18 WITHDRAWAL FROM PARTICIPATION.
   (A)   An officer or employee must refrain from acting on or discussing,

failing to act on the matter, may personally or financially benefit any of the
persons or entities listed in §
36.15(C) above. Such an officer or employee should join the public if the
withdrawal occurs at a public meeting or leave the room if it is a legally
conducted closed meeting under KRS 61.810 and KRS 61.815.
   (B)   Withdrawal at a meeting requires the public announcement, on the
record, of the reason for withdrawal.
   (C)   Ongoing conflict. An officer or employee whose outside employment or
other outside activity or relationship can reasonably be expected to require
more than sporadic withdrawal must resign or cease such outside employment or
activity. An officer or employee should not begin employment or an activity or
relationship that can reasonably be expected to require more than sporadic
withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is in such a situation, he or
she should not accept the position with the city.
   (D)   Request to withdraw. If an officer or appointed board member is
requested to withdraw from participation in a matter for the reason that he or
she has a conflict of interest, by:
      (1)   Another member;
      (2)   A party to the current matter; or
      (3)   Anyone else who may be affected by a decision relating to this
matter, the member must decide whether to withdraw on the official record. If
the member decides not to withdraw, the challenging member(s) may file a
complaint with the ethics board.

§ 37.01 OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   KRS Chapter 103 authorizes the city to issue industrial building
revenue bonds in order to promote local economic development through the
introduction, retention and expansion of business and industry. The city will
issue industrial revenue bonds only for projects located in the city and
encourages the use of local and Kentucky bond counsel, architects, engineers,
contractors and the like in the development of the project.
   (B)   Although, pursuant to KRS Chapter 103, industrial revenue bonds do not
constitute an indebtedness of the city, the merits of each application will be
scrutinized as to whether any proposed project will benefit the entire
community and whether other forms of financing are feasible or desirable.
(Ord. 07-2002, passed 4-16-2002)
§ 37.02 APPLICATION PROCESS.
   (A)   Applicants seeking approval of a project for financing through the
issuance of industrial revenue bonds should initiate negotiations by
correspondence with the Mayor or his or her designee. The applicant should
submit a detailed proposal in the form of a letter of inducement addressed to
the Mayor specifying the characteristics of the project, including an estimate
of the benefits to the community, as itemized cost/benefit analysis and a
description of the public service impact of the project.
   (B)   Applicants must complete an industrial building revenue bond
application form and submit same to the City Administrative Officer. An
application deposit of $2,500 must accompany the application. Any amount of the
application deposit not required to compensate the city for necessary expenses
incurred during review of the application will be refunded.
(Ord. 07-2002, passed 4-16-2002)
§ 37.03 APPLICATION REVIEW.
   (A)   The City Administrative Officer is responsible for reviewing the
proposed terms of the bond issuance and may require the applicant to submit the
following:

      (2)   A copy of the letter of inducement addressed to the Mayor;
      (3)   An independent audit and certified financial statement of the
applicant or applicants for the most current complete year, prepared and
certified by an independent certified public accounting firm. Audit statements
prepared by an independent certified public accounting firm for the last three
complete years are preferred and may be requested by the City Administrative
Officer; and
      (4)   A letter from the proposed purchaser of bonds confirming its intent
and evidencing its ability to purchase the bonds.
   (B)   The City Administrative Officer may request additional information if
necessary in order to adequately review any project.
   (C)   The City Administrative Officer may promulgate written policies and
guidelines for the review of applications for the issuance of industrial
building revenue bonds not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Following receipt of the City Administrative Officer's recommendation,
the Mayor shall respond to the applicant and may propose qualifications or
reservations to the terms of bond issuance.
   (E)   The city may require that applicants for the issuance of industrial
revenue bonds arrange for the private placement of the bonds with reputable
financial institutions.
(Ord. 07-2002, passed 4-16-2002)
§ 37.04 PROJECT APPROVAL.
   (A)   Following completion of the review process described in §
37.03 above, an inducement resolution and memorandum of agreement, setting
forth the general terms and conditions of the loan arrangement and other
matters pertaining to the project shall be forwarded to the City Council for
consideration. The City Council may request any additional information it deems
necessary to adequately review the project.
   (B)   If the inducement resolution is passed, the passage would constitute
an expression of the intent of the City Council to issue industrial building
revenue bonds to finance the applicant's project. Passage of the inducement
resolution must precede any expenditures by the applicant for the project in
order for the expenditure to be eligible for reimbursement from the proceeds of
the bonds issued to finance the project.
   (C)   The city, as consideration for the issuance of the bonds and the use
of the proceeds to finance a qualified project, will enter into a loan
agreement with a successful applicant. The applicant will acknowledge its
obligations under the agreement by a note which will require payments of
principal and interest corresponding in time and amount to the principal and
interest payments becoming due on bonds issued to finance the project.
(Ord. 07-2002, passed 4-16-2002)
§ 37.05 ISSUANCE OF BONDS; FEE.
   (A)   The final legal step prior to issuance of industrial building revenue
bonds is the passage of a bond ordinance by the City Council, which ordinance,
if passed, shall include:
      (1)   The loan agreement between the city and the applicant; and
      (2)   The indenture of trust between the applicant and the trustee for
the bond holders.
   (B)   If bonds are issued, the city requires an issuing fee of .02% (.0002)
of the principal amount of the bond issue in consideration for the issuance of
the bonds and to satisfy all costs, including attorney's fees, incurred by the
city in issuing the bonds.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 PURPOSE; POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the waste water collection and treatment system for the city
and enables the Commission to comply with all applicable state and federal laws
required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment
Regulations (40 C.F.R. part 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal waste
water system which will interfere with the operation of the system or including
interference with its use or disposal of municipal sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal waste
water system which will pass through the treatment works, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the
system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim municipal and
industrial waste waters and sludge from the system; and
      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
waste water system.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal waste water system through the issuance of
permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to the city and to persons outside the city
who are, by contract or agreement with the Commission users of the city's
publicly owned treatment works (POTW). Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Manager of the city's POTW shall administer, implement and enforce the
provisions of this chapter.

the effective date of this chapter. Construction shall be completed within 120
days of approval of plans and notification by the Manager. No user who
commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter
shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental
and/or slug discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and
approval of the plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from
the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental and/or slug
discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and
notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions.
   (B)   Written notice. Within five days following an accidental and/or slug
discharge, the user shall submit, to the Manager, a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. The notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a
result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this subchapter or
applicable law.
   (C)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or suffer the dangerous discharge to occur are advised
of the emergency notification procedure.

   (A)   The user charge shall reflect the costs of operation and maintenance,
including replacement, of the POTW.
   (B)   Each user shall pay its proportionate share of operation and
maintenance (including replacement cost based on volume of flow).
   (C)   The city shall review, not less often than annually, the user charge
system. The user charge shall be revised as necessary to accomplish the
following:
      (1)   Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and
maintenance costs among users as provided herein; and
      (2)   Generate at least sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and
maintenance costs necessary for the proper operation and maintenance, including
replacement, of the sewage works.
   (D)   All flow to the sewage works not directly attributable to user (such
as, infiltration/inflow) shall be distributed among all users of the sewage
works based upon the volume of flow of the users.
   (E)   Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a
regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charge which is
attributable to operation and maintenance of the POTW.
(Ord. 7-92, passed 2-4-1992)
§ 52.108 SURCHARGES.
   (A)   Excessive strength surcharge.
      (1)   In the event a user discharges wastes to the sewage works in excess
of the limitations as stated in §
52.061(B)(20), the user shall pay a surcharge based upon the excess strength of
its wastes.
      (2)   The surcharge will be calculated by obtaining the normal sewer
service; then from the analysis of the discharge determining the strength of
the discharge waste; selecting the proper multiplier based on the strength of
the discharge and then multiplying the normal sewer service by that figure.
      (3)   The costs of treatment for each parameter removed by the POTW shall
be reviewed at the time of and in conjunction with the review of the user
charge. Surcharge rates shall be revised where necessary to approximate current
treatment costs. These rates shall be in effect until the next rate review.
   (B)   Method of billing surcharge.
      (1)   The excessive strength surcharge shall be based on the following
formula, with the total applied to the monthly bill of effected users:
Actual Test Results - Current Limits = Amount Exceeding Limitation
Surcharge = (AEL) × 8.34 × (TMF) × (CP)
   AEL = Amount Exceeding Limitation (mg/1)
   TMF = Total Monthly Flow (MGD)
    CP = Cost per Pound
      (2)   No reduction in sewage service charges fees or taxes shall be
permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the sewage
works contains less than the current limitations.

ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
§ 52.135 SUSPENSION ORDER; NOTIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The Manager may suspend the waste water treatment service and/or an

which is presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons, the POTW or the environment.
   (B)   Any user notified of a suspension of waste water treatment service
and/or the industrial user discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate
the contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Manager shall take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to
any individuals. The Manager shall allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth
in §
52.139 are initiated against the user.
   (C)   An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or part, for
imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and measures taken to prevent any future

administrative orders issued pursuant to division (B) of this section.
   (B)   Compliance order. When the Manager finds that an industrial user has
violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued
thereunder, he or she may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for
the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service
shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may
also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment
technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices.
   (C)   Cease and desist orders. When the Manager finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, the Manager may issue an order to cease and desist all such

show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall
be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or

places it in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is not the result of
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper
operation, shall inform the Manager thereof immediately upon becoming aware of
the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written report thereof
shall be filed by the user within five days. The report shall contain:
      (1)   A description of the upset, its cause(s) and impact on the
discharger's compliance status;
      (2)   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance and, if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to be restored; and
      (3)   All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset.
   (B)   An industrial user which complies with the notification provisions of
this section in a timely manner shall have an affirmative defense to any
enforcement action brought by the Manager for any noncompliance with this
chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder by the user, which arises out of
the documented and verified upset.

discovery of an unanticipated bypass. If necessary, the Manager may require the
industrial user to submit a written report explaining the cause(s), nature and
duration of the bypass and the steps being taken to prevent its recurrence.
   (C)   An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is for
essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system.
Industrial users anticipating a bypass must submit notice to the Manager at
least ten days in advance. The Manager may only approve the anticipated bypass
if the circumstances satisfy those set forth in this section.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 54.001 TITLE AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Title. This chapter shall be known as the "Surface and Storm Water
Utility Ordinance for the City of Hopkinsville, Kentucky".
   (B)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard the lives, health,
safety, welfare and property of the public; promote sound development policies
and construction procedures which respect the city's watercourses; establish
minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated
with increased surface and storm water runoff; provide for the planning,
design, construction, use, maintenance, repair and inspection of the surface
and storm water systems; establish programs and regulations to assure the
quality of the water in such a system; decrease drainage-related damage to
public and private property; meet the requirements of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II regulations as established by the
Clean Water Act; and minimize flooding and provide for the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter within the city.
      (2)   This chapter complements other city ordinances and regulations
regarding protection of the surface and water systems.
      (3)   This chapter is enacted to protect and preserve the public health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the city. The provisions of this chapter
shall be liberally construed to accomplish this purpose.
(Ord. 32-2005, passed 12-6-2005)
§ 54.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   It is hereby determined that:
   (A)   Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover
alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase surface and
storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding potential, stream channel
erosion and sediment transport and deposition;
   (B)   Surface and storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of
water-borne pollutants;
   (C)   Surface and storm water runoff, soil erosion and non-point source
pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of surface and
storm water runoff from development sites;
   (D)   The regulation of surface and storm water runoff discharge from land
development projects and other construction activities in order to control and
minimize increases in surface and storm water runoff rates and volumes, erosion
and non-point source pollution associated with surface and storm water runoff
is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety;
   (E)   Existing surface and storm water runoff and drainage systems must be
adequately maintained, operated and replaced through a funding program that is
fair and equitable;
   (F)   All developed real property within the service area contributes runoff
that impacts the surface and storm water management system and should
participate financially in the development, operation, maintenance and
administration of the surface and storm water management system;
   (G)   The extent of a parcel's impervious surfaces and rate of surface and
storm water runoff from the parcel are primary factors determining the parcel's
contribution to flow rate and quantity of runoff and impacts upon the surface
and storm water management system;
   (H)   The public health, safety and welfare is adversely affected by poor
ambient water quality and flooding results from the quality and quantity of
surface and storm water;
   (I)   All real property in the city either uses or benefits from a properly
maintained surface and storm water system;
   (J)   The extent of use of the surface and storm water system by each
property is dependant on factors that influence runoff, including but not
limited to, land use and the amount of impervious surface on the property;
   (K)   The costs of improving, maintaining, operating and monitoring the
surface and storm water system should be allocated, to the extent practicable,
to all property owners/developers/applicants based on the impact of runoff from
the impervious areas of their property on the surface and storm water
management system; and
   (L)   Management of the surface and storm water system to protect the public
health, safety and welfare requires adequate revenues and it is in the interest
of the public to finance surface and storm water management adequately with a
user fee system that is reasonable and equitable so each user of the system
pays to the extent to which he or she contributes to the need for it.

   (A)   The storm water management program is established and the storm water
system is provided to protect the waterways and land in the City of
Hopkinsville by managing flooding and to benefit the natural environment. The
cost of designing, developing, improving, operating, maintaining and monitoring
the storm water system required in the City of Hopkinsville should, therefore,
be allocated, to the extent as practicable, to all property based on the impact
on the storm water system. In order to provide revenue to fund those costs and
to fairly allocate those costs, a Storm Water Management Fund (“the Fund”) is
established.
   (B)   All revenues collected from the storm water management fee from
grants, permit fees and other charges collected under the Chapter, shall be
deposited into the Fund. The City Council may make additional appropriations to
the Fund. All disbursements from the Fund shall be for the purposes of the Fund
as set forth.
(Ord. 36-2005, passed 1-3-2006; Ord. 45-2006, passed 12-5-2006)

§ 54.095 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   (A)   A monthly service fee is imposed upon all real property in the City of
Hopkinsville, beginning no earlier than April 1, 2006, to fund storm water
management programs. This service fee shall be known as the storm water
management fee (“fee”). Any real property developed or added through annexation
into the City of Hopkinsville after January 1, 2006 shall be subject to a
monthly service fee.
   (B)   The fee is based on:
      (1)   The extent to which runoff from each property creates the need for
the storm water management program;
      (2)   The amount of impervious area on each property; and
      (3)   The cost of implementing a storm water management program.
(Ord. 36-2005, passed 1-3-2006; Ord. 45-2006, passed 12-5-2006)
§ 54.096 CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINATION OF THE STORM
WATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   (A)   For purposes of determining the storm water management fee, all
properties in the City of Hopkinsville are classified into one of the following
classes:
      (1)   Single-family residential (SFR) property;
      (2)   Non-single family residential (non-SFR); or
      (3)   Non-developed property.
   (B)   The Council finds that the contribution to runoff of most parcels of
real property in the City of Hopkinsville classified as single-family
residential is similar and that it would be excessively and unnecessarily
expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the improvements (such
as buildings, structures and other impervious areas) on each parcel. Therefore,
all single-family residential properties in the city shall be charged a flat
storm water management fee, equal to the base rate, as provided herein.
   (C)   The fee for non-SFR property in the City of Hopkinsville shall be the
base rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total
impervious area (square feet) of the property by the ERU. The impervious
surface area for non-SFR property is the square footage for the buildings and
other improvements on the property. At the sole discretion of the utility, the
impervious surface area of non-SFR property may be approximated through site
examination, mapping information, aerial photographs and other available
information. The minimum storm water management fee for other developed
property shall equal the base rate for single-family residential property.
(Ord. 36-2005, passed 1-3-2006; Ord. 45-2006, passed 12-5-2006)
§ 54.097 BASE RATE.
   A monthly base rate for the storm water management fee is established for
all single-family residential property as one ERU. The base rate for all
single-family residential property which contains impervious surface area less
than one-half of the ERU as set forth in §
54.103 shall pay one-half of the established fee as set forth in §
54.098.
(Ord. 36-2005, passed 1-3-2006; Ord. 45-2006, passed 12-5-2006)
§ 54.098 SCHEDULE OF MONTHLY RATES FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   The following schedule of rates shall apply to each property. This schedule
includes the rate for the storm water utility fees.
 
Rate Category                 Rate per Month
Single-family residential     $3
Non-single-family residential $3
                              Multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by
                             dividing the total impervious area (square feet)
                              of the property by one equivalent residential
                              unit (ERU).

§ 54.099 FEE FOR TAX-EXEMPT PROPERTIES; EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The City Council finds that all real property in the City of
Hopkinsville contributes to runoff and either uses or benefits from the
maintenance of the storm water system. Therefore, all real property in the
city, including property that is tax exempt from property tax by the Kentucky
Revised Statutes, as amended, shall be charged with the fee.
   (B)   Property which is owned by the City of Hopkinsville shall be charged
with the fee.
   (C)   All federal, state, county and city roads are exempt from the fee and
are considered to be part of the City of Hopkinsville drainage system.
   (D)   Non-developed property in its natural state shall be exempt from the

§ 54.100 ASSESSMENT NOTICES.
   (A)   The utility may, but is not required to, send assessment notices for
the fee to property owners prior to the billing for the fee.
   (B)   If assessment notices are sent, the notice shall include the following
information:
      (1)   The classification of the property for purposes of determining the
fee;
      (2)   For property classified as other developed property:
         (a)   The impervious surface area of the property; and
         (b)   The method by which the impervious surface area of the property
was determined; that is whether the computation of the impervious surface area
of the property is based on information in the Christian County Property
Valuation Office, site examination, mapping information, aerial photographs or
other methods.
      (3)   The amount of the base rate (i.e., the single-family residential
fee), and for other developed property, the number of base units on the
property.
(Ord. 36-2005, passed 1-3-2006; Ord. 45-2006, passed 12-5-2006)
§ 54.101 WHEN STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FEE PAYABLE; INTEREST AND PENALTIES; LIEN
ON RENTAL PROPERTY; ABATEMENT OF SMALL AMOUNTS DUE.
   (A)   The fee shall be billed on a monthly basis. The utility shall
determine the most effective method of billing. Billings for any particular
month shall be made by the due date shown on the bill. Any payment not received
within 15 business days after the bill due date shall be considered delinquent
and upon notification by the utility, HWEA is authorized to disconnect and
terminate water service to the premises subject to Hopkinsville Code of
Ordinances §§
53.20,
53.21 and
53.37.
   (B)   If a bill is rendered to a party who is not the property owner and the
bill becomes unpaid and/or delinquent, then the property owner shall bear the
responsibility of payment.
   (C)   The fee charged to any customer that is due for a fiscal year must be
paid within 30 days after the bill is mailed or issued to the property owner
and is overdue after that date. An overdue fee bears interest and penalties at
the rate of 12% per annum or fraction of a month that the fee is overdue.
   (D)   The fee, including interest and penalties, when overdue is a lien on
real property and may be collected by a suit against the property owner.
   (E)   The utility may abate the fee, including interest and penalties, if
the cost of collection is reasonably estimated to exceed the amount of the fee,
including any interest and penalties, due and payable.

§ 54.102 REQUEST FOR CORRECTION OF THE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   (A)   A property owner may request correction of the fee by submitting the
request in writing to the utility within 30 consecutive days after the date the
assessment notice or the bill is mailed or issued to the property owner.
Grounds for correction of the fee include:
      (1)   Incorrect classification of the property for purposes of
determining the fee;
      (2)   Errors in the square footage of the impervious surface area of the

after receipt of the property owner’s completed written request for correction
of the fee. The utility’s decision on a request for correction of the fee shall
be final.
   (C)   A property owner must comply with all rules and procedures adopted by
the utility when submitting a request for correction of the fee and must
provide all information necessary for the utility to make a determination on a
request for correction of the fee. If a property owner alleges an error
hereunder, the request for correction must include certification by a
registered engineer or professional land surveyor of the impervious surface
area of the property. Failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection
shall be grounds for denial of the request.

   This chapter shall be known as the "Illicit Discharge Detection and
Elimination (IDDE) Chapter for the City of Hopkinsville, Kentucky".
(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property
and prevent damage to the environment in the City of Hopkinsville, and more
specifically is intended to:
      (1)   Prohibit the introduction of any foreign matter, whether liquid or
solid, other than normal surface or naturally occurring storm water into the
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer system (MS4) or any conveyance;
      (2)   Prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4 or any
conveyance; and
      (3)   Establish legal authority to carry out all inspections,
surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
section.
   (B)   This chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of
pollutants into the MS4 in order to comply with requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process.
(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.03 PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   This chapter is enacted to promote the public welfare by regulating the
contribution of pollutants to the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)
by non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage system in the city.
(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.04 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Clean Water Act, EPA and KYDOW established Phase II regulations and
mandated Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination (IDDE) procedures in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky. Discharges to an MS4 that are not composed entirely
of storm water runoff contribute to increased non-point source pollution and
degradation of receiving waters. These non-storm water discharges occur due to
spills, dumping and improper connections to the MS4 from residential,
industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. These non-storm water
discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically
dispersed, small volume non-storm water discharges can have cumulative impacts
on receiving waters. The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public
health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic
life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. These impacts can be
minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the MS4
in Hopkinsville.
(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.05 AUTHORITY.
   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is empowered to regulate storm
water by the authority of the Clean Water Act. The City of Hopkinsville,
classified as a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) under Phase II of
the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Storm Water
Program, is empowered to regulate non-storm water discharges.
(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.06 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
following meaning.
   ADVERSE IMPACT. A material negative impact to the land, water and associated
resources resulting from an illicit discharge. The negative impact includes
degradation of water quality, increased sedimentation, reduced groundwater
recharge, adverse effects on aquatic organisms and other resources and threats
to public health.
   AUTHORIZED ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. The Hopkinsville Surface and Storm Water
Utility (SSWU), or its designated agent, will enforce the chapter.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP). Any structural or non-structural control
measure used to improve the quality and, as appropriate, reduce the quantity of

(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.09 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this section are
minimum standards; therefore, this section does not intend nor imply that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution or unauthorized discharge of pollutants or hazardous materials.
(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.10 DISCHARGE EXCEPTIONS/ PROHIBITIONS.
   Other than naturally occurring storm water, no person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged into the MS4 or any conveyance any materials, including,
but not limited to, pollutants or hazardous materials or waters containing any
pollutants or hazardous materials that cause or contribute to a violation of
applicable water quality standards. Allowable discharges that create or have
the potential to create unsafe conditions on city streets or other public
rights-of-way are prohibited. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any
illegal discharge to the MS4 or any conveyance is prohibited except that the
following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this
section, if the discharges do not violate applicable water quality standards.
   (A)   General exceptions. Water line flushing or water from other potable
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, uncontaminated ground water infiltration, foundation or footing
drains, air conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of

permit holder is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit and
other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has
been granted for any discharge to the MS4 or any conveyance.
   (D)   Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance
or continued existence of illicit connections to the MS4 or any conveyance is
prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection. A drainage system connection permit is required by the city before
any drainage system is connected to the MS4. The drainage system connection
permit shall be accompanied by a $50 fee. A person is considered to be in
violation of this section if the person connects a line conveying sewage or any
other pollutant or hazardous materials to the MS4 or any conveyance or allows
such a connection to continue.
   (E)   Industrial or construction activity discharges. Any person subject to
an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall
comply with all provisions of the permit. Proof of compliance with the permit
may be required in a form acceptable to the city prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4 or any conveyance. However, should an illicit discharge
be detected from such activities, the city shall have the authority to regulate
the site per the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.11 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   (A)   The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or any
conveyance through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at such
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants or hazardous materials to the MS4 or any
conveyance. These BMPs shall be part of a BMP plan as necessary for compliance
with requirements of the NPDES permit.
   (B)   In the event of any accidental illicit discharge into the MS4 in an
amount that could cause a threat to public health, safety or welfare of the
citizens of the city or the environment, the person responsible for the
discharge or his or her designee shall:
      (1)   Give notice of the accidental discharge to the SSWU or its
designated agent as soon as practicable. In no event shall this notice be more
than two hours after the discovery of the accidental discharge or when the
responsible person becomes aware of the circumstances of the incident;
      (2)   Call 911 immediately to report the accidental discharge if an
emergency response by government agencies is needed;
      (3)   Submit a written report of the accidental discharge within five
days of the time of the accidental discharge. The report shall contain the
following information:
         (a)   A description of the accidental discharge; this description
shall include, but may not be limited to, the material discharged, the amount
of material discharged and the amount of material recovered;

any adverse impact to the MS4 and/or any watercourse;
      (5)   The city and/or the SSWU and/or its designated agent shall assume
no liability for any improper reporting by a responsible person regarding an
accidental discharge; and
      (6)   Reporting of an accidental discharge as defined in this section
does not relieve the responsible person from complying with all other reporting
requirements as mandated by applicable laws and/or regulations.
(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.12 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES AND INSPECTION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   The SSWU or its designated agent shall be permitted to enter and
inspect any property or facilities subject to regulation under this section as
often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this section. If a
discharger has security measures in force that require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access by the SSWU or its designated agent
(Ord. 32-2005 § 24, as amended). (See
Ch. 54 of this code of ordinances.)
   (B)   Facility operators shall allow the SSWU or its designated agent ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law.
   (C)   The SSWU or its designated agent shall have the right to install on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agent to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's discharge.
   (D)   The SSWU or its designated agent shall have the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the SSWU or its designated agent and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
   (F)   Any interference with allowing the SSWU or its designated agent access
to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of
this section. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the SSWU reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this section.
   (G)   If the SSWU or its designated agent has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which storm water is discharged and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
section, or any order issued hereunder to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, the SSWU may seek all appropriate remedies
from any court of competent jurisdiction, including the issuance of a search
warrant (Ord. 32-2005 § 26, as amended). (See
Ch. 54 of this code of ordinances.)
(Ord. 36-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 55.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Enforcement. The SSWU or its designated agent may pursue appropriate
legal proceedings for the enforcement of this chapter and the SSWU shall be
entitled to recover its costs expended and reasonable attorney's fees in such
proceedings. If the person, property or facility has or is required to have a
storm water discharge permit from KYDOW, the SSWU shall notify the appropriate
state authorities of the violation. Any of the following enforcement remedies
and penalties, to be applied independently or in a sequence as deemed
necessary, shall be available to the city or the SSWU in response to violations
of this chapter:
      (1)   Enforcement proceedings for this section shall be initiated by the
issuance of a notice of violation (NOV) or a citation by the SSWU or its
designated agent;
      (2)   The provisions of this chapter may be enforced by the Code of
Chapter Enforcement Board established in
Chapter 33 of the Hopkinsville Code of Ordinances or in the alternative, the
Christian County District Court as a misdemeanor and/or violation;
      (3)   For violations involving active permits, the city or the SSWU may
revoke and require surrender of a permit or certificate by notifying the permit
holder, in writing, of the reason for the revocation. Permits or certificates
may be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved plans thereby
resulting in an illicit discharge as defined herein (Ord. 32-2005 § 23, as
amended) (See
Ch. 54 of this code of ordinances.);
      (4)   For violations involving active construction sites, the SSWU or its
designated agent may issue a stop work order and require that all activities
cease, except those actions that are necessary to eliminate the illicit
discharge. Unacceptable or untimely actions attempting to eliminate the illicit
discharge may be used as justification to revoke permits as described above;
      (5)   Suspension of MS4 access due to illicit discharges in emergency
situations. The city or the SSWU may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of persons, to
the MS4, or to waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply
with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city or the SSWU may take
such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4, or
waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons; and/or
      (6)   Suspension of MS4 access due to the detection of illicit discharge.
Any person discharging to the MS4 or any conveyance in violation of this
section may have their MS4 access terminated if the termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The city or the SSWU shall require the violator to
disconnect access to the MS4 at their cost or take corrective action to
eliminate the source of the illicit discharge. A person commits an offense if
the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this
section without the prior approval of the SSWU.
   (B)   Penalties.
      (1)   Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of
its requirements shall be fined not more than $500, nor less than $100.
      (2)   Each day such violation continues after receipt of a notice of
violation shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein shall prevent
the SSWU from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation (Ord. 32-2005 § 36, as amended).
   (C)   Costs of abatement of a violation.
      (1)   Any person causing a violation of this section which requires the
city and/or the SSWU to expend public funds for the response to the violation,
its abatement or the cleanup or removal of any prohibited discharges,
pollutants or hazardous materials shall be liable to the city and/or the SSWU
for all recoverable fees and costs incurred by the city and/or the SSWU for the
response, cleanup and removal, including but not limited to, personnel costs of
any city departments, replacement costs of supplies and equipment contaminated
as a result of the discharge, proper disposal of contaminated materials,
cleanup, evacuation and administrative and other expenses, including legal
expenses, incurred in recovering the costs.
      (2)   Any such illegal discharges shall be considered a public health
hazard and the city or SSWU shall have a lien against the property for its
recoverable costs if these costs are not paid within 90 days of invoice.

§ 56.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the "Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control
(EPSC) Chapter for the City of Hopkinsville, Kentucky".
(Ord. 37-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 56.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property and
prevent damage to the environment in the City of Hopkinsville, and more
specifically is intended to:
   (A)   Conserve, preserve and enhance the natural resources of the city,
including its soils, waters, vegetation, fish and wildlife;
   (B)   Control soil erosion and sedimentation arising from development and
other land disturbing activities (i.e. grading and clearing) to prevent adverse
impacts and off-site degradation including short-term and long-term damage to
public and private property;
   (C)   Comply with all applicable state and federal requirements for clean
water, including limitations on discharge of pollutants as set forth in
Kentucky's Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (KPDES); and all applicable
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit for
Phase II municipalities; and
   (D)   Provide definitive procedures for erosion prevention and sediment
control (herein under EPSC) regulations and review, as applied in the city.
(Ord. 37-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 56.03 PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   This chapter is enacted to promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating
and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any
development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in
the movement of earth or land in the city.
(Ord. 37-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 56.04 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Clean Water Act, EPA and KYDOW established Phase II regulations and
mandated Erosion Protection and Sediment Control (EPSC) procedures for
construction in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. During the construction process,
soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers
water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic
habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates
repair of sewers, ditches, sinkholes and drywells. Streets and roads with
sediment deposits are slick and hazardous to the public. In addition, clearing
and grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation necessary
for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
(Ord. 37-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 56.05 AUTHORITY.
   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is empowered to regulate storm
water by the authority of the Clean Water Act. The City of Hopkinsville,
classified as a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) under Phase II of
the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Storm Water
Program, is empowered to regulate non-storm water discharges.

(Ord. 37-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 56.10 PERMITS AND PLANS.
   (A)   General. A grading and clearing permit is required (Ord. 32-2005, §
16-22, see
Ch. 156) to be obtained from the SSWU for land disturbances as set out herein
below. The landowner and/or developer shall also coordinate with the KYDOW and
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether any permits are required
from those agencies before construction begins. No permit shall be required
from the SSWU for emergency activity that is immediately necessary for the
protection of life, property or natural resources. In the event of an emergency
activity, notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone,
facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person
or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
SSWU within three business days of the visit or phone notice. This notification
should include details of emergency measure(s) taken and if needed, a plan for
permanent repair. Grading and clearing permit applications shall include the
appropriate fee of $50 which is in addition to the fees required for all
activities requiring a land excavation, grading, paving, swimming pool,
building and all other types related permits required from the city for
construction permits requiring a notice of intent (NOI). The grading and
clearing permit is required to be obtained from the SSWU for improvements
meeting any the following criteria:
      (1)   Any land alterations in the public right of way, within 20 feet of
a public roadway, ten feet of a ditch or within a drainage easement;
      (2)   An increase in impervious area greater than 3,350 square feet and
site disturbance less than one acre and which is not part of a Storm Water
Management Plan (SWMP); and/or
      (3)   Site disturbances of 2,000 square feet or more.
   (B)   Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control Plan (EPSC Plan).
      (1)   The SSWU requires an EPSC Plan to accompany the grading and
clearing permit for development that disturbs one acre or greater (per KPDES
general permit). The plan must be approved before obtaining a grading and
clearing permit. When preparing the EPSC, the design engineer and/or developer
should determine the best practices to protect active construction sites by
selecting source control and sediment containment practices. In doing so, most
erosion problems can be avoided and sediment containment issues can be
addressed prior to construction disturbances.
      (2)   All EPSCs shall be designed in a manner to minimize the need for
maintenance and reduce the chances of failure. Design guidelines should follow
the most recent version of Kentucky Best Management Practice for Construction
Erosion, Sediment, and Pollutant Runoff from Construction Sites: Planning and
Technical Specifications Manual (Kentucky BMP Manual) and must be submitted in
an accepted digital format.
      (3)   Storm water easements and covenants shall be provided by the
property owner for access for facility inspections and maintenance. Easements
and covenants shall be recorded with Christian County Clerk's Office prior to
the issuance of a permit. Final design shall be approved by the SSWU or its
designated agent.
      (4)   The EPSC Plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
         (a)   Site boundaries;
         (b)   Lakes, streams, channels, ditches, wetlands and other
watercourses on or adjacent to the site;
         (c)   Location and approximate dimension of storm water drainage
systems and natural drainage patterns on or immediately adjacent to the sites;
         (d)   Location and approximately dimension of all land disturbance
area;
         (e)   Potential locations of stockpiles;
         (f)   A natural resources map identifying soil types, forest cover,
topography, 100-year flood plain, critical areas and other natural features of
concern. This map should be to scale equivalent to balance of submittal;
         (g)   A schedule of events for the construction of the development
site, including stripping and clearing, rough grading, construction of
utilities, infrastructure, final grading and landscaping. Sequencing shall
identify the expected date on which clearing will begin, the estimated duration
of exposure of cleared areas, areas of clearing, installation of temporary
erosion prevention and sediment control measures and establishment of permanent
vegetation;
         (h)   All EPSC measures necessary shall be shown on the plan by
location and referred to by a legend for all phases of construction. Depending
upon the complexity of the project, the drafting of intermediate plans may be
required at the close of each season. Multiple EPSC plan sheets may be
necessary to best convey requirements for each phase;
         (i)   Seeding mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seedbed
preparation, expected seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer
application and type and quantity of mulch for both temporary and permanent
vegetative control measures; and
         (j)   Provisions for maintenance of control facilities, including
easements and estimates of the cost of maintenance.
      (5)   Modifications to the plan shall be submitted as follows. The
modifications may be authorized by the SSWU by written authorization to the
permittee.
         (a)   Major amendments of the EPSC plan require an engineer's
signature and shall be submitted to the SSWU for acceptance.
         (b)   Field modifications of a minor nature shall require an
engineer's signature and shall be noted and dated on the EPSC record drawings
and available for review and acceptance by the SSWU.
      (6)   EPSC plans shall be accompanied by a $50 fee which is in addition
to the grading and clearing permit fee, and any other applicable fees.
(Ord. 37-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 56.11 REVIEW AND ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   The SSWU or its designated agent will review each permit application to
determine its conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Approval
indicates that minimum requirements or intent are met and does not imply a
guarantee of performance. Based on the review of the permit application, the
SSWU will:
   (A)   Approve the permit application;
   (B)   Approve the permit application subject to such conditions as may be
necessary to meet the requirements/intent of the objectives of this chapter,

After EPSC measures have been installed, the permittee shall contact the SSWU
and request a preconstruction inspection.
   (B)   Upon completion of the preconstruction inspection and approval of EPSC
measures, the grading and clearing permit will be issued.
   (C)   The SSWU shall make inspections as deemed necessary to ensure the EPSC
measures as outlined in the Kentucky BMP Manual are being properly implemented
and maintained during construction. If minimum requirements for the EPSC are
not met, the permittee may be notified and enforcement actions shall be taken.
   (D)   The permittee or his or her agent shall make regular inspections of
all control measures to determine the overall effectiveness of the EPSC plan
and the need for additional control measures. The minimum frequency of these
inspections shall be once every seven calendar days and before and after storm
events of a half-inch of precipitation or more. All inspections shall be
documented in written form and kept on the construction site. Reports should be
available for the city or state inspectors to review.
(Ord. 37-2007, passed 11-20-2007)
§ 56.13 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   In the event an owner/developer/applicant or on-site personnel impede or
attempt to impede, in any manner, utility personnel or duly appointed agents of
the utility from performance of inspections as outlined in this chapter, a
search warrant as authorized by the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky shall
be obtained to assure the inspection process can be completed as required and
mandated.

§ 57.09 COMPLIANCE WITH BUILDING CODE REQUIRED.
   No gas service from the Commission's distribution system shall be made
available to any buildings hereafter constructed without proof of compliance
with all applicable planning, zoning, and building codes.
(Ord. 19-2011, passed 10-18-2011)
§ 57.10 AUTHORIZATION FOR PASS THROUGH ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   Authorization. The Commission is hereby authorized to pass gas cost
adjustments on to customers, whether increases or decreases, from the supplier
of the Commission gas system to maintain the balanced efficiency of the gas
division. The Commission shall be apprised of such increases or decreases as
the case may be, whenever they occur.
   (B)   Pass Through Adjustments (PTA). The PTA adjustment is intended to
assure that the gas division adjusts for volatile changes in the commodity cost
of gas. The "Commodity Cost of Gas" is the Commission's monthly gate cost of
gas. This includes the actual gas cost plus the interstate pipeline volumetric
and storage costs involved in transporting the gas from the source of supply to
the Commissioner's gate regulator station. The PTA will be calculated as needed
to be applied to the first billing that follows. Any balance over or under
recovery of gas cost at the end of each month may be passed through to the
subsequent month PTA accordingly. The “monthly” cost of gas is the Commission’s
system’s actual gate cost of gas compared to the base cost of gas. If the
monthly cost of gas exceeds the base cost of gas, the amount will be an
increase. If the monthly cost of gas is less than the base cost of gas, the
amount will be a decrease. The cost of gas at the wellhead, or source of
supply, has been unregulated for years and is affected by free market factors
such as supply, demand, and competition. The Commission system does not profit
from the PTA adjustment. It adjusts for the gas system’s monthly city gate gas
costs only. It does not affect operation and maintenance, fixed demand costs,
or other costs incurred by the utility. The PTA will be calculated monthly on
the last business day of each month to be applied to the first billing that
follows. Any balance over or under recovery of gas cost at the end of each
month may be passed through the subsequent month PTA accordingly.

§ 57.11 NATURAL GAS AGREEMENT; MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The General Manager shall have the authority, under circumstances
where it is economically feasible and beneficial for the Commission to do so,
to modify the specific terms of the natural gas agreement entered into between
the Commission and a specific end use consumer that is eligible for and has
elected to receive service as the General Manager deems necessary to induce
such consumer to locate plant facilities in the natural gas service area, or to
locate plant expansions that will increase the consumer’s usage of natural gas
at its facilities in the natural gas service area, rather than locating such
plant facilities or plant expansions in other locations not served by the
division.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, the Commission
through its General Manager shall have authority to negotiate terms and grant
incentives to encourage commercial and industrial customers to connect to the

customers who agree to purchase volumes of gas over a period of time sufficient
to justify special incentives within the discretion of the Commission. Such
special contracts must be reviewed and approved by the Commission on an
individual basis. This section shall not be construed to require the Commission
to enter into any contract, or to agree to any specific terms, conditions or
provisions, with any natural gas customer.

event customer fails to curtail his use of gas in accordance with the
Commission's verbal notice of curtailment. The Commission shall have the
authority, under circumstances where it is economically feasible and beneficial
to the city, to modify the specific terms of the WACOG natural gas sales
agreement entered into between the Commission and a specific industrial end use
customer, under §
57.11 herein, as the Commission deems necessary to induce such customer to
locate plant facilities in the city or the city's service area or to locate
plant expansions that will increase the customer's usage of natural gas at its
facilities in the city or the city service area, rather than locating such
plant facilities or plant expansions in other locations not served by the
Commission.
   (E)   Interruptible or Firm Sales and/or Interruptible or Firm
Transportation Service may be offered if available from the Commission's
supplier and if offered by the Commission. If offered, the rate for the
specific service will be set by the Commission and will include, operations and
maintenance costs, fixed costs, and any other costs incurred by the Commission.
   (F)   Due to the volatility of natural gas operating costs, the monthly
meter charge, fees, the base rate, the weighted average cost of gas (WACOG),
Interruptible/Firm Sales, and/or Interruptible or Firm Transportation Service,
if available and offered, may be set, adjusted and approved annually by the
Commission and will remain stable throughout the fiscal year (July 1 through
June 30), unless otherwise approved by the Commission.

   In the event any bill or part thereof for gas service is not paid in full by
the fifteenth day after the due date, HWEA is authorized to disconnect and cut
off the gas service to any premises associated with any accounts for which the
account holder or other responsible party is liable, even those premises whose
associated accounts are not past due. Once gas service is disconnected to any
premises for nonpayment, HWEA is authorized to refuse to resume service to any
such premises until the entire past due account for which service was
disconnected is paid in full.
(Ord. 06-2015, passed 6-16-2015)
§ 57.99 PENALTY.
   If any industrial or commercial purchaser of natural gas from the Commission

(Ord. 40-2006, passed 10-17-2006) Penalty, see §
99.99
§ 99.24 CITY MAINTAINED RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   Unless otherwise set forth and referenced in this chapter or by agreement by
the city, the city has no maintenance responsibilities for private drives,
private alleys and/or private easements platted within the corporate city
limits.
   (A)   Streets.
      (1)   Dedication and acceptance of city streets shall comply with the
provisions of the Hopkinsville Subdivision Regulations, the Hopkinsville Public
Improvement Specifications, and this chapter.
      (2)   The city may, in cases where a private drive has been opened to
unrestricted use of the general public for five years, dedicate and accept the
drive into public maintenance without formal dedication or record dedication
plat. When a request is made to accept a drive for maintenance, the following
procedures apply.
         (a)   A written request shall be submitted to the Planning Commission
and shall state the use and purpose to base maintenance responsibilities. The
request shall also state any other information regarding past use or history of
the drive(s).
         (b)   The location of the drive(s) will be placed on a map showing
adjoining property owners.
         (c)   The Planning Commission will determine the history of the drive
(s) as it pertains to:
            1.   Past use;
            2.   Public purpose;
            3.   Utility use;
            4.   Drainage use;
            5.   Future use or need; and/or
            6.   Any other information.
         (d)   The information will be forwarded to the city with a
recommendation regarding the disposition of the drive(s) and whether the city
should assume maintenance. The recommendation will be based on findings that:
            1.   The acceptance of the drive(s) fulfills a public purpose; or
            2.   The city has maintained the drive(s) in the past.
         (e)   The city can either accept the recommendation or adopt its own
determination.
         (f)   Adoption of a recommendation by Hopkinsville City Council shall
authorize the appropriate department or agency to take the necessary action.

of past maintenance work performed by city employees, the city will assume
maintenance responsibilities for the alley to a level or degree of maintenance
which satisfies the public purpose or to the level of past maintenance
activities.
      (2)   Utilities. In situations where a public utility has utilized an
alley for the construction or routing of a utility service, the public utility
is responsible to maintain the alley to the degree necessary to service or
access the utilities in question. The city will not be responsible for
maintaining the alley unless there is evidence of past city maintenance or a
public purpose. In circumstances where there are dual or multiple uses of an
alley, each perspective entity (e.g. city and/or a public utility) will
maintain the alley to the degree or level needed to meet its uses or needs.
      (3)   Procedure. When a request is made to accept an alley for
maintenance, the following procedures apply.
         (a)   A written request shall be submitted to the Planning Commission
and shall state the use and purpose to base maintenance responsibilities. The
request shall also state any other information regarding past use or history of
the alley(s).

purposes for which it was dedicated, may be used for the purpose of
constructing, operating and repairing a communications facility. PUBLIC RIGHTS-
OF-WAY do not include buildings, parks or other property owned or leased by the
city, including, by way of example and not limitation, structures in the public
rights-of-way such as utility poles and lights. No reference herein, or in any
franchise, to a public right-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or

(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.02 FRANCHISE OR LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (A)   Purpose and characteristics. In order to enable the city to treat
persons providing similar services similarly, as may be appropriate to comply
with applicable law and considering differences in circumstances; and to comply
with requirements of federal law which may require the city to separate its
authority over cable systems and open video systems from its authority over
other providers of telecommunications services, the city requires individual
authorizations for the provision of particular services. The revocation of a
franchise for one particular service in and of itself will not affect the
authority of a cable or open video system franchise holder to continue to
occupy the rights-of-way to provide services for which it holds other
authorizations. No authorization, whether in the form of a franchise or
otherwise, shall be exclusive. The issuance of a franchise or license shall not
affect the city’s right to itself construct, operate, or repair any
communications facility, with or without a franchise or license.
   (B)   When a franchise is required. A cable operator must obtain a franchise
prior to constructing a cable system or providing cable service within the
city; an operator of an open video system must obtain a franchise before
constructing an open video system or providing services within the city via an
open video system. The fact that a particular franchised communications
facility may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain
a franchise or authorization for other purposes. No franchise shall become
effective without the franchisee signing the ordinance which grants it the
franchise.
   (C)   When a license is required. Subject to the requirements of state law,
a communications facility operator must obtain a license prior to constructing
a communications facility which passes through, but does not serve, and is not
designed to serve any person in the city. For such facilities, the City
Administrative Officer is authorized to issue licenses.
   (D)   Nature of grant. Neither a franchise nor a license shall convey title,
equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way. The right granted is only the
right to occupy public rights-of-way, for the purposes and for the period
stated in the franchise or license; the right may not be subdivided or
subleased. Every franchise or license shall be:
      (1)   Interpreted in a manner that conforms to the requirements of the
city code of ordinances;
      (2)   Deemed to include all the provisions that are required to be in a
franchise or license under the code of ordinances, as if fully set forth in the
franchise or license; and
      (3)   Deemed to provide for forfeiture under the circumstances set forth
in the code of ordinances, as well as under the provisions of this chapter and
any franchise ordinance thereunder.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.03 COMPENSATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   Purpose. To ensure that the city, as far as possible, is compensated
for the rights granted, and receives fair market value for use of property over
which it exercises control, or which is held in public trust; and to ensure
that the city is compensated for expenses arising from the use of that
property; and to ensure that similarly situated persons providing the same
services are treated similarly, as far as is possible and appropriate
considering differences in circumstances; the city shall require persons using
its public rights-of-way to provide cable service, or open video system
services to pay compensation as provided in this chapter.
   (B)   Every operator must pay. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this chapter, every cable operator; and every operator of an open video system
must:
      (1)   Pay an application fee for the consideration of an application for
issuance, transfer or modification of a franchise or license in the amount of
$10,000, which fee shall be submitted along with the application. Unused
portions of the application fee shall be returned to an applicant;
      (2)   Establish a fund to cover costs of issuing permits and conducting
inspections related to the permits and compliance with conditions on right-of-
way use, as provided in division (D); and
      (3)   Pay a fee for the use of the public rights of way to conduct
business, which fee is referred to below as a “license” fee or “franchise” fee.
Subject to the exception in division (C) below, the amount paid shall be the
applicable amount specified in §
100.38.
   (C)   Exceptions. The amounts required under § 100.38 need not be paid if
state law or the city code of ordinances requires otherwise; or during any
transition period for a current franchise or license holder. This exception
shall be read narrowly; an operator that is engaged in one line of business
that is subject to this exception, shall not be excused from paying the fee for
its other lines of business. In cases subject to this exception, the highest
permissible fee shall be paid.
   (D)   Billable work order. Each communications facility operator shall file
an annual billable work order with the CAO to cover the city’s actual costs of
administration and inspection of the operator’s physical facilities and
activities in the public rights-of-way. On January 31 of each year, every
communications facility operator shall deposit with the city’s Finance Director
an amount calculated by the CAO to cover the cost of work likely to be
performed by the city under that billable work order during the succeeding July
1 through June 30. The city may draw upon that deposit to cover its costs. The
CAO at any time may require a communications facility operator to replenish the
amount deposited on January 31, if it appears that the initial deposit will be
exhausted during the course of the year. No permit issued shall be valid or of
any force or effect if an operator fails to make the required deposits. The
amount paid and used for the work orders may be credited against taxes owed to
the city, to the extent required by state law.
   (E)   Application to persons that provide different types of services. The
fact that a fee is paid on one type of service provided over a communications
facility, does not excuse an operator from its duty to pay fees on other types
of services that it may be authorized to provide over that facility. As an
example, and not as a limitation of the foregoing, a cable operator that pays a
franchise fee on revenues derived from the provision of cable services must
also pay any fees that may be established by the city from time to time on use
of the rights-of-way by persons providing telecommunications services, to the
extent the cable system is used for such purposes.
   (F)   General rules for payment of fees.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified in a franchise or a license, franchise
and license fees shall be paid to the city quarterly, and not later than 30
days after the end of each calendar quarter.
      (2)   Unless a franchise or license provides otherwise, each franchise or
license fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in
which the fee was calculated.
      (3)   No acceptance by the city of any franchise or license fee shall be
construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor
shall the acceptance of the franchise or license fee payment be construed as a
release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable.
      (4)   The franchise or license fee payment is not a payment in lieu of
any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically provided in this
chapter, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, permit fees and business license taxes are not waived and remain
applicable.
      (5)   Within 90 days following the end of the calendar year, each person
which paid a franchise fee shall submit a statement, certified as true by an
independent auditor or the chief financial officer of the person, setting forth
gross revenues of the communications facility, by category, and describing what
revenues were included and excluded in the fee calculation, and any adjustments
made to gross revenues. If payments are late, in addition to paying any
applicable penalties or damages, the person that owes the fee shall pay
interest on the amount owed at the statutory interest rates applicable to
judgments. Any person holding a license shall submit a statement showing how it
calculated the license fee owed.
      (6)   The city may, from time to time, and upon reasonable advance
written notice, inspect and audit any and all books and records reasonably
necessary to the determination of whether fees have been accurately computed
and paid.
      (7)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a person that is
obligated to pay a fee ceases to provide service for any reason (including as a
result of a transfer), such person shall make a final payment of any amounts
owed to the city within 90 calendar days of the date its operations in the city
cease, and shall provide a statement of gross revenues for the calendar year
through the dates operations ceased which statement shall contain the
information and certification required by division (F)(5) above.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.04 GENERAL CONDITIONS UPON USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Responsibility for costs. Except as expressly provided otherwise, any
act that a communications facility operator, its contractors or subcontractors
are required to perform under this section shall be performed at their cost. If
a communications facility operator fails to perform work that it is required to
perform within the time provided for performance, the city may perform the
work, and bill the communications facility operator therefor. The
communications facility operator shall pay the amounts billed within 30 days.
   (B)   Construction procedures and placement of facilities; obligation to
minimize interference with use of public rights-of-way.
      (1)   The construction, operation and repair of communications facilities
are subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the city that have
jurisdiction in such matters and shall be performed in compliance with all
laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations and practices affecting
such facilities. By way of example, and not limitation, this includes zoning
codes and safety codes and city construction standards. In addition, the
construction, operation and repair shall be performed in a manner consistent
with high industry standards. Persons engaged in the construction, operation or
repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable care in the
performance of all their activities, and use commonly accepted methods and
devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage,
injury or nuisance to the public or to property.
      (2)   Construction, operation or repair of a communications facility
shall not commence until written permits required by city code or practice have
been filed for and obtained from the proper city officials and all required
permit and associated fees paid. In any permit so issued, the city may impose
as a condition of the granting of the permit such conditions and regulations as
may be necessary to the management of the public rights-of-way, including, by
way of example and not limitation, for the purpose of protecting any structures
in the public rights-of-way, for the proper restoration of such public rights-
of-way and structures, and for the protection of the city and the public and
the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
      (3)   Operators of communications facilities must follow city-established
requirements for placement of facilities in public rights-of-way, including the
specific location of facilities in the public rights-of-way, and must in any
event install facilities in a manner that minimizes interference with the use
of the public rights-of-way by others, including others that may be installing
communications facilities. The city may require that facilities be installed at
a particular time, at a specific place, or in a particular manner as a
condition of access to a particular right-of-way; may deny access if an
operator is not willing to comply with the city’s requirements; may remove any
facility that is not installed in compliance with the requirements established
by the city, or which is installed without prior city approval of the time,
place, or manner of installation and charge the operator of the facility for
all the costs associated with removal; and may require a person using the
public rights-of-way to cooperate with others to minimize adverse impacts on
the public rights-of-way through joint trenching and other arrangements.
      (4)   Upon order of the City Administrative Officer or his or her
designee, all work which does not comply with the permit, the approved plans or
specifications for the work, or the requirements of this chapter or other
applicable law shall be removed.
      (5)   The city may require as a condition of issuing any right-of-way
permit for underground conduit, the installation of which requires excavation
of or along any traveled way, that the franchisee, licensee or holder of the
right-of-way permit emplace conduit, in excess of its present and reasonably
foreseeable requirements, for the purpose of accommodating other franchisees
and licensees for a reasonable charge.
      (6)   To the extent possible, operators of communications facilities
shall use existing poles and conduit in installing their system. In no case may
additional poles be installed in the public rights-of-way without the
permission of the city; any person who is permitted to install poles must lease
capacity on those poles to others, at a rate not higher than the rate that
would be permitted if 47 U.S.C. § 224 applied.
      (7)   Unless otherwise specified in a franchise or license, all
facilities shall be constructed, installed and located in accordance with the
following terms and conditions:
         (a)   Communications facilities shall be installed within an existing
underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity exists within the utility
facility.
         (b)   Poles may not be installed without the written permission of the
city.
         (c)   Whenever any existing telephone, electric utility, or cable
system facilities are located underground, a person installing another
communications facility must also place its communications facilities
underground.
         (d)   Whenever any existing telephone, electric utility or
communications facilities are located or relocated underground, operators of
other communications facilities that then occupy the same public rights-of-way
shall concurrently relocate their respective facilities underground.
         (e)   Any and all public rights-of-way, public property or private
property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation or
repair of a communications facility shall be promptly repaired by the
communications facility operator that disturbed or damaged the public rights-
of-way, public property or private property.
         (f)   No tree trimming shall be performed without the permission of
the city and other affected authorities, and any tree trimming must be
performed in strict accordance with the city code of ordinances.
         (g)   At the end of a scheduled franchise term, the poles and conduits
owned by a franchisee shall become the property of the city, unless the city
requires their removal; provided, however, that, if a franchise is renewed
pursuant to this chapter, the city will continue to allow a franchisee to
occupy the poles and conduits at the lowest rate charged to any other
commercial entity (not including rates that may be charged through a joint use
agreement). If the city elects to require the removal of a franchisee’s poles
and conduits, the city shall, within 180 days of the end of a scheduled
franchise term, notify a franchisee in writing that the facilities must be
removed.
   (C)   Relocation of facilities.
      (1)   A communications facility operator shall, by a time specified by
the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove any of
its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions; public
safety; public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way repair (including
resurfacing or widening); change of public right-of-way grade; construction,
installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal
lines, tracks or any other type of government-owned communications system,
public work or public facility; improvement of any government-owned utility;
public right-of-way vacation; or for any other purpose where the work involved
would be aided by the removal or relocation of the communications facility.
Collectively, such matters are referred to below as the “public work”.
         (a)   Except in the case of emergencies, the city shall provide
written notice describing where the public work is to be performed at least
four weeks prior to the deadline by which a communications facility operator
must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its
facilities. A communications facility operator may seek an extension of the
time to perform such tasks where they cannot be performed in four weeks, even
with the exercise of due diligence, and such request for an extension shall not
be unreasonably refused.
         (b)   In the event of an emergency, or where a communications facility
creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety or property,
the city may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove or relocate any
or all parts of the communications facility without prior notice, and charge
the communications facility operator for costs incurred.
      (2)   If any person that is authorized to place facilities in the public
rights-of-way requests another communications facility operator receiving the
request to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove or relocate its
facilities to accommodate the construction, operation or repair of the
facilities of such other person, the communications facility operator shall,
after 30-days’ advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary
changes requested. Unless the matter is governed by a valid contract or a state
or federal law or regulation, or in other cases where the communications
facility that is being requested to move was not properly installed, the
reasonable cost of the same shall be borne by the party requesting the
protection, support, temporary disconnection, removal or relocation and
performed at no charge to the city.
      (3)   A communications facility operator shall, at the request of any
person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily
raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings or other objects.
The expense of the temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be
paid by the person requesting the same. A communications facility operator
shall be given not less than 14-days’ advance notice to arrange for the
temporary wire changes.
      (4)   A communications facility operator may abandon any property in
place upon notice to the city, unless the city determines, in the exercise of
its reasonable discretion within 90 days of the notice of abandonment from the
operator, that the safety, appearance, functioning or use of the public rights-
of-way and facilities in the public rights-of-way will be adversely affected
thereby, in which case the operator must remove its property by a date
specified by the city.
   (D)   Facility subject to inspection; operator must provide information.
      (1)   Every communications facility shall be subject to the right of
periodic inspection and testing by the city to determine compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, a franchise agreement or license, or other
applicable law. The city shall have the right, upon request, to be notified and
present when the communications facility is tested by the operator. Each
operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system and
plans for the system as the city may from time to time issue, including
requests for information regarding its plans for construction, operation and
repair, and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed, operated or
repaired.
      (2)   Each operator of a communications facility that places facilities
underground shall be a member of the regional notification center for
subsurface installations (underground services alert) and shall field mark the
locations of its underground communications facilities upon request. The
operator shall locate its facilities for the city at no charge.
   (E)   Plans for and publicizing work.
      (1)   Work shall be publicized as the city may direct from time to time.
      (2)   Each communications facility owner shall provide the city with a
plan for any initial system construction, or for any substantial rebuild,
upgrade or extension of its facility, which shall show its timetable for
construction of each phase of the project, and the areas of the city that will
be affected.
   (F)   No discrimination.
      (1)   A communications facility operator shall not deny service, deny
access or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers or residents
of the city on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age,
conditions of physical disability, religion, ethnic background or marital
status.
      (2)   A communications facility operator shall not discriminate among
persons or the city or take any retaliatory action against a person or the city
because of that entity’s exercise of any right it may have under federal, state
or local law, nor may the operator require a person or the city to waive such
rights as a condition of taking service.
      (3)   Except as federal law prohibits enforcement of this provision, a
communications facility operator shall be prohibited from denying access or
levying different rates and charges on any group of potential customers because
of the income of the residents of the local area in which the group resides.
      (4)   A communications facility operator shall not refuse to employ,
discharge from employment or discriminate against any person in compensation or
in terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of race, color, creed,
national origin, sex, age, physical disability, religion, ethnic background or
marital status. A communications facility operator shall comply with all
federal, state and local laws and regulations governing equal employment
opportunities, as the same may be from time to time amended.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.05 PROTECTION OF THE CITY AND RESIDENTS.
   (A)   Indemnification. No franchise or other authorization to use the public
rights-of-way issued to a communications facility operator shall be valid or
effective until and unless the city obtains adequate indemnity from the
operator. The indemnity must at least:
      (1)   Release the city from and against any and all liability and
responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance
of the communications facility. Each communications facility operator must
further agree not to sue or seek any money or damages from the city in
connection with the above mentioned matters;
      (2)   Indemnify and hold harmless the city, its trustees, elected and
appointed officers, agents and employees, from and against any and all claims,
demands or causes of action of whatsoever kind or nature, and the resulting
losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys’ fees, liabilities, damages,
orders, judgments or decrees, sustained by the city or any third party arising
out of, or by reason of, or resulting from or of the acts, errors or omissions
of the communications facility operator, or its agents, independent contractors
or employees related to or in any way arising out of the construction,
operation or repair of the facility; and
      (3)   Provide that the covenants and representations relating to the
indemnification provision shall survive the term of any franchise or other
authorization and continue in full force and effect as to the party’s
responsibility to indemnify.
   (B)   Insurance. No franchise or other authorization to use the public
rights-of-way issued to a communications facility operator shall be valid or
effective until and unless the city obtains assurance that the operator (and
those acting on its behalf) have adequate insurance. At a minimum, the
following requirements must be satisfied:
      (1)   A communications facility operator shall not commence construction
or operation of the facility without obtaining all insurance required under
this division and approval of the insurance by the CAO of the city, nor shall a
communications facility operator allow any contractor or subcontractor to
commence work on its contract or subcontract until all similar such insurance
required of the same has been obtained and approved. The required insurance
must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the communications
facility operator has facilities in the public rights-of-way, and for a period
thereafter as specified in the minimum coverages described below. If the
operator, its contractors or subcontractors do not have the required insurance,
the city may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is
obtained and approved.
      (2)   Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required
insurance, shall be filed with the CAO. For entities that are entering the
market, the certificates shall be filed prior to the commencement of
construction and once a year thereafter, and as provided below in the event of
a lapse in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the public rights-of-
way as of the effective date of this chapter, the certificate shall be filed
within 60 days of the date of this chapter, annually thereafter, and as
provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage, unless a pre-existing
franchise or license provides for filing of certificates in a different manner.
      (3)   These certificates shall contain a provision that coverages
afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least 30-days’
prior written notice has been given to the city. Policies shall be issued by
companies authorized to do business under the laws of the State of Kentucky.
Financial ratings must be no less than “A” in the latest edition of Best’s Key
Rating Guide, published by A.M. Best Guide.
      (4)   In the event that the insurance certificate provided indicates that
the insurance shall terminate or lapse during the term of a franchise or other
authorization, then in that event, the communications facility operator shall
furnish, at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the date of the insurance,
a renewed certificate of insurance as proof that equal and like coverage will
be in force for the balance of the period of the franchise or license under
which the communications facility operates. Copies of policies will be provided
upon request.
      (5)   A communications facility owner or operator, and its contractors or
subcontractors engaged in work on the operator’s behalf in, on, under or over
public rights-of-way, shall maintain the following minimum insurance:
         (a)   Comprehensive general liability insurance to cover liability for
bodily injury and property damage. Exposures to be covered are: premises,
operations, products/completed operations and certain contracts. Coverage must
be written on an occurrence basis, with the following limits of liability:
            1.   Bodily injury.
               a.   Each occurrence: $1,000,000.
               b.   Annual aggregate: $3,000,000.
            2.   Property damage.
               a.   Each occurrence: $1,000,000.
               b.   Annual aggregate: $3,000,000.
            3.   Personal injury.
               a.   Each occurrence: (To be determined by city).
               b.   Annual aggregate: $3,000,000.
            4.   Maintenance. Completed operations and products liability shall
be maintained for two years after the termination of the franchise or license
(in the case of the communications facility owner or operator) or completion of
the work for the communications facility owner or operator (in the case of a
contractor or subcontractor).
            5.   Liability. Property damage liability insurance shall include
coverage for the following hazards:
               a.   X - Explosion;
               b.   C - Collapse; and
               c.   U - Underground.
         (b)   Workers’ Compensation Insurance shall be maintained to comply
with statutory limits for all employees, and in the case any work is sublet,
each communications facility operator shall require the subcontractors
similarly to provide workers’ compensation insurance for all the latter’s
employees unless the employees are covered by the protection afforded by each
communications facility operator. Each communications facility operator and its
contractors and subcontractors shall maintain during the life of this policy
employer’s liability insurance. The following limits must be maintained:
            1.   Workers’ compensation: statutory.
            2.   Employer’s liability: $500,000 per occurrence.
         (c)   Comprehensive auto liability.
            1.   Bodily injury.
               a.   Each occurrence: $1,000,000.
               b.   Annual aggregate: $3,000,000.
            2.   Property damage.
               a.   Each occurrence: $1,000,000.
               b.   Annual aggregate: $3,000,000.
         (d)   Coverage shall include owned, hired and non-owned vehicles.
      (6)   All insurance policies, excluding the Workers’ Compensation
insurance policy, shall name the city, its officers, trustees, elected and
appointed officials, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees
as additional insureds.
      (7)   Each communications facility operator shall hold the city, its
agents and employees, harmless on account of claims for damages to persons,
property or premises arising out of its construction, operation or repair of
its communications facility.
      (8)   In every franchise or license agreement, the city shall reserve the
right to require any other insurance coverage it reasonably deems necessary
depending upon the exposures.
   (C)   Surety instruments. Every communications facility operator shall
establish a cash security fund, or provide the city with an irrevocable letter
of credit in the same amount, to secure the payment of fees owed, to secure any
other performance promised in a franchise or license and to pay any taxes, fees
or liens owed to the city. The fund or letter of credit shall be in the initial
amount of $50,000, unless a franchise agreement or license provides otherwise.
The letter of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to
the City Attorney. Should the city draw upon the cash security fund or letter
of credit, it shall promptly notify the communications facility operator, and
the communications facility operator shall promptly restore the fund or the
letter of credit to the full required amount. This security fund/letter of
credit may be waived or reduced by the CAO for a franchisee or licensee where
the CAO determines in its discretion that a particular franchisee’s or
licensee’s operations are sufficiently limited that a security fund/letter of
credit is not necessary to secure the required performance.

§ 100.06 ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES.
   (A)   City Administrative Officer responsible for administration. The City
Administrative Officer or his or her designee is responsible for enforcing and
administering this chapter, and the City Administrative Officer or his or her
designee is authorized to give any notice required by law or under any
franchise or license, including by way of example and not limitation, a notice
required under 47 U.S.C. § 546. The City Administrative Officer is also
authorized to seek information from any communications facility operator, to
establish forms for submission of applications and other information, and to
take all other actions necessary or appropriate to the administration of this
chapter. Franchises may only be issued or revoked by action of the City
Council.
   (B)   Applications for franchises and licenses.
      (1)   An application must be filed for an initial franchise or license,
for a transfer or for renewal of a franchise or license. Each entity that is
required to hold a franchise or license must submit an application therefor to
the CAO in accordance with the requirements of this chapter; a request for a
cable franchise renewal properly submitted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(a) will
be reviewed in accordance with §
100.33(E). To be accepted for filing, an original and six copies of a complete
application for a franchise, and an original and three copies of a complete
application for a license, showing the routes the applicant proposes to use,
must be submitted to the CAO. All applications shall be available for public
inspection. All applications shall include the names and addresses of persons
authorized to act on behalf of the applicant with respect to the application.
      (2)   An application may be filed by any person on that person’s own
initiative or in response to a request for proposals. The CAO is authorized to
issue requests for proposals from time to time.
      (3)   An applicant that is awarded a franchise or license, shall, in
addition to making all the other payments required herein, pay to the city a
sum of money sufficient to reimburse it for all publication expenses incurred
by it in connection with the granting of a franchise or license pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter. The payment shall be made within 30 days after the
city furnishes the franchisee or licensee with a written statement of such
expenses by delivery of payment to the Director of Finance.
      (4)   No franchise or license shall become effective until all required
fees and costs are paid.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, pledges in
trust or mortgages of the assets of a franchised or licensed communications
facility to secure the construction, operation, or repair of the system may be
made without application and without the city’s prior consent; except that no
such arrangement may be made if it would in any respect or under any condition
prevent the communications facility operator or any successor from complying
with the franchise or license and applicable law, nor may any such arrangement
permit a third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or
control the communications facility, without the prior consent of the city. Any
mortgage, pledge or lease shall be subject to and subordinate to the rights of
the city under any franchise or license, this chapter or other applicable law.
   (C)   Minimum contents of every franchise or license. In addition to
satisfying the other applicable requirements of this section, every franchise
or license for a communications facility shall contain the following
provisions.
      (1)   The franchise or license shall provide that neither the granting of
any franchise or license, nor any provision thereof, shall constitute a waiver
or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power, police power, or
regulatory power of the city as may exist at the time the franchise or license
is issued or may thereafter be obtained.
      (2)   The franchise or license shall only authorize occupancy of the
public rights-of-way to provide the services and for the purposes described in
the franchise or license.
      (3)   A franchise or license shall be a privilege that is held in the
public trust and is personal to the original franchisee or licensee. The
franchise or license shall ensure that no transfer of the franchise or license
may occur, directly or indirectly, without the prior consent of the city;
except as contemplated by §
100.39 or as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.
      (4)   The franchise or license shall ensure that any person placing
communications facilities in the public rights-of-way will not discriminate in
hiring, in contracting, or in the provision of services.
      (5)   The franchise or license shall contain appropriate provisions for
enforcement, compensation, and protection of the public which are consistent
with the other provisions of this chapter.
      (6)   The franchise or license shall be for a specified term, set forth
in the franchise or license. No franchise issued under this chapter shall be
for a term of longer than ten years; no license issued under this chapter shall
be for a term of longer than five years.
      (7)   Such other terms as are required by the city code of ordinances.
   (D)   Revocation, reduction of term or forfeiture of franchise or license.
      (1)   Licenses shall be revocable at will.
      (2)   Where, after notice and providing the franchisee an opportunity to
be heard (if the opportunity is timely requested by a franchisee), the city
finds that the facility is being maintained or operated in violation of this
chapter or in substantial violation of the terms of the franchise, the city may
make an appropriate reduction in the remaining term of the franchise or revoke
the franchise. The City Administrative Officer or his or her designee is
authorized to establish and conduct a proceeding that comports with the
requirements of this division, and to issue a recommended decision, but any
such decision may be appealed to the City Council. Any appeal must be filed
within 30 days of the decision of the City Administrative Officer or it shall
be deemed waived. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchise may not be
revoked unless the franchisee:
         (a)   Was given notice of the default;
         (b)   Thirty days to cure the default;
         (c)   The franchisee failed to cure the default, or to propose a
schedule for curing the default acceptable to the city where it is impossible
to cure the default in 30 days. The required notice may be given before the
city conducts the proceeding required by this division; and
         (d)   No opportunity to cure is required for repeated violations, and
fraud shall be deemed incurable.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may declare a franchise
forfeited where the franchisee:
         (a)   Fails to begin to exercise its rights under the franchise within
a period specified in the franchise;
         (b)   Stops providing service it is required to provide in the
franchise;
         (c)   Without the prior consent of the city, transfers the franchise;
         (d)   Fails to pay the fees owed hereunder; or
         (e)   Defrauds or attempts to defraud the city or the operator’s
customers.
      (4)   The city shall give a franchisee 30-days’ notice of an intent to
declare a franchise forfeited, and shall provide the franchisee an opportunity
to show cause why the franchise should not be forfeited.
      (5)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, any franchise or license shall be
deemed revoked 120 calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of
creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business
of the franchisee or licensee, whether in a receivership, reorganization,
bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or
proceeding. Provided, however, the franchise or license may be reinstated if,
within that 120-day period:
         (a)   The assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated;
         (b)   The assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise or license, and has
executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, under which it
assumes and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and
the franchise or license; and
         (c)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of foreclosure or
other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a
franchisee or licensee, the city may revoke the franchise or license, following
a public hearing before the City Council, by serving notice upon the franchisee
or licensee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise
or license and all rights and privileges of the franchise or license will be
revoked and will terminate 30 calendar days after serving the notice, unless:
            1.   The city has approved the transfer of the franchise or license
to the successful bidder; and
            2.   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city
to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise or license
and this chapter.
   (E)   Effect of termination or forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of
a franchise, or termination or forfeiture of a license, whether by action of
the city as provided above, or by passage of time, the franchisee or licensee
shall be obligated to cease using the communications facilities for the
purposes authorized by the franchise or license. The city may require the
licensee or franchisee or its bonding company to remove some or all of the
licensee’s or franchisee’s facilities from the public rights-of-way and to
restore the public rights-of-way to their proper condition. Should the
franchisee or licensee neglect, refuse, or fail to remove the facility, the
city may remove the facility at the expense of the franchisee or licensee. The
obligation of the licensee or franchisee to remove shall survive the
termination of the franchise or license for a period of two years. Provided
that, this provision does not permit the city to take possession of, or require
the franchisee or licensee to remove, any facilities that are used to provide
another service for which the franchisee or licensee holds a valid franchise or
license issued by the city. Provided further, nothing in this section shall
affect the city’s right to take possession of abandoned facilities.
   (F)   Remedies cumulative. All remedies under this chapter and any franchise
or license are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of
one remedy shall not foreclose the use of another, nor shall the exercise of a
remedy or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties relieve a
communications facility operator of its obligations to comply with its
franchise or license. Remedies may be used singly or in combination; in
addition, the city may exercise any rights it has at law or equity. Recovery by
the city of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security
fund or letter of credit, or otherwise, does not limit a communications
facility operator’s duty to indemnify the city in any way; nor shall such
recovery relieve a communications facility operator of its obligations under a
franchise or license, limit the amounts owed to the city, or in any respect
prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. Nothing
herein shall be read to authorize the double-recovery of damages.
   (G)   Access to books and records.
      (1)   Each communications facility operator shall provide the city with
access to all books and records related to the construction, operation or
repair of the communications facility so that the city may inspect and copy
these books and records. The operator’s obligation includes the obligation to
produce all books and records related to revenues derived from the operation of
the communications facility. An operator is responsible for obtaining or
maintaining the necessary possession or control of all books and records
related to the construction, operation or repair of the communications
facility, so that it can produce the documents upon request. Books and records
must be maintained for a period of five years, except that:
         (a)   Any record that is a public record must be maintained for the
period required by state law; and
         (b)   A franchise or license may specify a shorter period for certain
categories of voluminous books and records where the information contained
therein can be derived simply from other materials.
      (2)   For purposes of this chapter, the terms “books and records” shall
be read expansively to include information in whatever format stored. Books and
records requested shall be produced to the city at the CAO’s office, unless the
city directs otherwise, or by agreement or pursuant to division (G)(3) below.
      (3)   If any books and records are too voluminous, or for security
reasons cannot be copied and moved, then a communications facility operator may
request that the inspection take place at some other location mutually agreed
to by the city and the operator; provided that:
         (a)   The operator must make necessary arrangements for copying
documents selected by the city after its review; and
         (b)   The operator must pay all travel and additional copying expenses
incurred by the city (above those that would have been incurred had the
documents been produced in the city) in inspecting those documents or having
those documents inspected by its designee.
      (4)   Without limiting the foregoing, the operator of a communications
facility shall provide the city with the following within ten days of their
receipt or (in the case of documents created by the operator or its affiliate)
filing:
         (a)   Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of
the communications facility; and
         (b)   Copies of any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or
any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the franchisee or
licensee, or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the
franchisee or licensee directly or indirectly.
   (H)   Retention of records; relation to privacy rights. Each communications
facility operator shall take all reasonable steps required, if any, to ensure
that it is able to provide the city with all information which must be provided
or may be requested under this chapter, a franchise, a license or applicable
law, including by providing appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Each
operator shall be responsible for redacting any data that applicable law
prevents it from providing to the city. Nothing in this section shall be read
to require an operator to violate state or federal law protecting subscriber
privacy.
   (I)   Reports. The city may require operators of communications facilities
to maintain records and to prepare reports relevant to determining the
compliance of the communications facility operator with the terms and
conditions of this chapter and a franchise or license.
   (J)   Maps. Each communications facility operator shall maintain accurate
maps and improvement plans which show the location, size, and a general
description of all facilities installed in the public rights-of-way and any
power supply sources (including voltages and connections). Maps shall be based
upon post-construction inspection to verify location. The operator of each
communications facility shall provide a map to the city showing the location of
its facilities, in such detail and scale as may be directed by the City
Administrative Officer. New maps shall be promptly submitted to the city when
the facility expands or is relocated. Copies of maps shall be provided on disk,
in a format specified by the City Administrative Officer.
   (K)   Compliance with laws. Each franchisee or licensee shall comply with
all applicable laws heretofore and hereafter adopted or established during the
entire term of its franchise or license.
   (L)   Reservation of authority. The city may do all things which are
necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this
chapter.
   (M)   No waiver. The failure of the city to insist on timely performance or
compliance by any person holding a license or franchise shall not constitute a
waiver of the city’s right to later insist on timely performance or compliance
by that person or any other person holding such a license or franchise.
   (N)   Chapter not a contract. The city expressly reserves the right to amend
this chapter from time-to-time in the exercise of its lawful powers. This
chapter shall not be construed to be a contract.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997; Ord. 35-2005, passed 12-20-2005)
§ 100.07 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Persons operating without a franchise or license. The operator of any
facility, the operation of which is required to be franchised or licensed under
this chapter, shall have three months from the effective date of this chapter
to file one or more applications for a franchise or a license under this
chapter. Any operator timely filing such an application shall not be subject to
a penalty under §
100.99 hereof for failure to have such a franchise or license as long as the
application remains pending; provided, however, nothing herein shall relieve
any communications facility operator of any liability for its failure to obtain
any franchise, license, permit or other authorization required under other
provisions of the code of ordinances, and nothing herein shall prevent the city
from requiring removal of any facilities installed in violation of the code.
   (B)   Persons holding franchises or licenses. Any person holding an
outstanding franchise or license from the city for a communications facility to
provide specified services may continue to operate under the existing franchise
or license to the conclusion of its present term (but not any renewal or
extension thereof) with respect to those activities expressly authorized by the
franchise or license; provided, however, that, the franchisee or licensee may
elect at any time to apply for a superseding franchise or license under this
chapter and must seek additional franchises or licenses to provide other
services; and provided further that, the person shall be subject to the other
provisions of this chapter to the extent permitted by law; provided further,
that licenses that are revocable at will may be revoked by the city, and the
licensee may be required to obtain a new license under this chapter.
   (C)   Persons with pending applications. Pending applications shall be
subject to this chapter. A person with a pending application shall be provided
30 days from the effective date of this chapter to submit additional
information to comply with the requirements of this chapter governing
applications.
   (D)   Transitional rules to be narrowly interpreted. It is the intent of the
city to apply the provisions of this chapter to communications facilities
operators, including local exchange carriers that now occupy or may in the
future occupy public rights-of-way, except to the extent federal or state law
prevents it from doing so.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.08 SPECIAL RULES FOR GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.
   Nothing herein requires the city to apply the provisions of this chapter to
the state or federal government or any agency or instrumentality thereof if the
city determines that it is not in the public interest to do so or that its
authority to do so is not clear. The City Administrative Officer is authorized
to enter into agreements with other governmental agencies to facilitate the
city’s use and management of its public rights-of-way.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.09 CALCULATION OF TIME.
   Unless otherwise indicated, when the performance or doing of any act, duty,
matter or payment is required under this chapter or any franchise or license,
and a period of time or duration for the fulfillment of doing thereof is
prescribed and is fixed herein, the time shall be computed so as to exclude the
first and include the last day of the prescribed or fixed period of duration
time.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE TO OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS
§ 100.20 APPLICATION FOR A FRANCHISE OR LICENSE.
   (A)   Contents of application for initial or renewal franchise. In order to
obtain an initial or renewal franchise, an operator of an open video system
must apply for a franchise. The application must contain the following
information and such additional information as the city may from time to time
require.
      (1)   Identity of the applicant; the persons who exercise working control
over the applicant; and the persons who control those persons, to the ultimate
parent;
      (2)   A proposal for construction of the open video system that includes
at least the following:
         (a)   A description of the services that are to be provided over the
facility;
         (b)   The identification of the area of the city to be served by the
proposed system, including a description of the proposed franchise area’s
boundaries;
         (c)   The location of the proposed facility and facility design,
including a description of the miles of plant to be installed; a description of
the size of equipment cabinets, shielding and electronics that will be
installed along the plant route; a description of the power sources that will
be used; and a description of the noise, exhaust and pollutants, if any, that
will be generated by the operation of the same; and
         (d)   A map of the route the facility will follow; a designation of
the portions of the system that will be placed above-ground and the portions
that will be placed underground, and the construction techniques that the
operator proposes to use in installing the system above-ground and under-
ground; a schedule for construction of the facility, describing when and where
construction will begin, how it will proceed, and when it will be completed;
and the expected effect on right-of-way usage, including information on the
ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system,
including, as appropriate given the system proposed, an estimate of the
availability of space in conduits and an estimate of the cost of any necessary
rearrangement of existing facilities. To the extent plans for the facility
required under this division have not been completed, an applicant may so
state, but:
            1.   The best available equivalent must be provided;
            2.   No construction may begin, even if a franchise issues, until
this information has been provided to and approved by the city; and
            3.   Any such grant will be conditional upon receipt and approval
of this information by the city.
      (3)   A description, where appropriate, of how services will be converted
from existing facilities to new facilities and what will be done with existing
facilities.
      (4)   Proof, attested to by a certified public accountant, that the
applicant has the financial resources to complete the proposed project, and to
construct, operate and repair the proposed facility over the franchise term. It
is not the intent of the city to require an applicant to prove that the
services it proposes to offer will succeed in the marketplace.
      (5)   Proof that an applicant is technically qualified to construct,
operate and repair the proposed facility. At a minimum, the applicant must show
that it has experience or resources to ensure that work is to be performed
adequately and can respond to emergencies during and after construction is
complete.
      (6)   Proof that the applicant is legally qualified, which proof must
include a demonstration that the applicant:
         (a)   Has received, or is in a position to receive, necessary
authorizations from state and federal authorities;
         (b)   Has not engaged in conduct (fraud, racketeering, violation of
antitrust laws, consumer protection laws or similar laws) that allows the city
to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with the requirements
of a franchise or the provisions of this chapter;
         (c)   Is willing to enter into a franchise, to pay required
compensation and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those
relating to the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities, and
has not entered into any agreement that would prevent it from doing so.
      (7)   An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer
thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the
application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of
applicable law.
      (8)   An applicant may show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a
franchise under division (A)(6)(b), by virtue of: the particular circumstances
surrounding the acts or omissions at issue; the steps taken by the applicant to
cure all harms flowing therefrom and to prevent their recurrence; and the lack
of involvement of the applicant’s principals, or the remoteness of the acts or
omissions from the operation of telecommunications facilities.
   (B)   Contents of application for initial or renewal license. In order to
obtain an initial or renewal license, an operator of an open video system must
apply for a license. The application must contain the information required by
division (A) above and such additional information as the city may from time to
time require.
   (C)   Additional information regarding affiliates; presumptions. To the
extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the financial or
technical resources of another person, including another affiliate, the
financial proofs required by divisions (A) and (B) should be provided for that
person as if it were the applicant. An applicant will be presumed to have the
requisite financial, technical or legal qualifications to the extent such
qualifications have been reviewed and approved by a state agency of competent
jurisdiction; or if an applicant is a holder of a franchise or license in the
city for a cable system or open video system. An applicant may initially
demonstrate its financial, technical and legal qualifications by showing that
it is entitled to such a presumption. However, nothing herein prevents the city
from conducting an independent review of qualifications.
   (D)   Applications for transfer. An application for a transfer of a
franchise or license must contain the same information required by divisions
(A) or (B), except that, if the transferor submitted an application under
divisions (A) or (B), to the extent information provided by the transferor
under divisions (A) or (B) remains accurate, the transferee may simply cross-
reference the earlier application.
   (E)   City review. The city may request such additional information as it
finds necessary, and require such modifications to the application as may be
necessary in the exercise of the city’s authority over open video systems. Once
the information required by the city has been provided, the application shall
be promptly reviewed and any approval will also be subject to a city
determination that:
      (1)   The applicant has the qualifications to construct, operate and
repair the system proposed in conformity with applicable law;
      (2)   The applicant will accept the modifications required by the city to
its proposed system. This section shall not be read to authorize the city to
exercise authority it does not otherwise have under applicable law;
      (3)   The applicant will enter into a franchise or license and will
comply with any conditions precedent to its effectiveness;
      (4)   In the case of a transfer, the city must also determine that:
         (a)   There will be no adverse effect on the public interest, or the
city’s interest in the franchise or license;
         (b)   The transferee will agree to be bound by all the conditions of
the franchise or license and to assume all the obligations of its predecessor;
and
         (c)   Any outstanding compliance and compensation issues have been
resolved or preserved to the satisfaction of the city.
      (5)   An applicant shall not be issued a franchise or license if it files
or in the previous three years filed materially inaccurate or misleading
information in a franchise or license application or intentionally withheld
information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide.
      (6)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may reject an application
for a license if it deems it in the public interest to do so.
   (F)   Compensation. Subject to the exception in §
100.03(C):
      (1)   Every operator of a franchised open video system shall pay to the
city a percentage of gross revenues derived from the operation of the open
video system in the city each quarter equal to the gross revenue percentage
paid by any cable operator, or, if there is no cable operator, the highest
amount that could be charged consistent with federal and state law. In
addition, unless a franchise provides otherwise, an open video system operator:
         (a)   Shall pay to the city, at a time directed by the city, an amount
equal to the highest amount contributed by any cable operator under its
franchise for and in support of public, educational and government use
(including institutional network use) of its cable system; and
         (b)   To the extent that a cable operator is providing other support
for public, educational or governmental use, the operator must duplicate that
support within a time and in a manner directed by the city, or provide a cash
equivalent acceptable to the city. If there is no cable operator, the city may
require the operator to pay the highest amount that may be charged consistent
with federal and state law. In applying this section, the city may take such
steps as it deems appropriate to ensure that the obligations borne by the open
video system operator are no greater or lesser than the obligation imposed upon
the cable operator providing the greatest benefits to the community. Further,
the city reserves the right, and every franchise shall be interpreted to
incorporate the right, to require the operator to pay additional compensation
if the provisions of federal law specifying the compensation to be paid by
operators changes or is declared invalid, or to ensure that the operator of an
open video system pays no less than the amount paid by any cable operator.
      (2)   Every operator of a licensed open video system shall pay to the
city a fee that recovers an amount equivalent to the fair market value of the
property used in the city. No license may be issued without an enforceable fee.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE TO CABLE SYSTEMS
§ 100.30 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESS CHANNEL. Any capacity on a cable system set aside by a franchise for
public, educational or governmental use.
   BASIC CABLE SERVICE or BASIC SERVICE. Any service tier that includes the
retransmission of local television broadcast signals.
   CABLE ACT. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C. §§ 521 et
seq., as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992, as further amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as
further amended from time to time.
   CABLE OPERATOR. Any person or group of persons:
      (1)   Who provides cable service over a cable system and directly or
through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such cable
system; or
      (2)   Who otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any
arrangement, the management and operation of such a cable system.
   EDUCATIONAL ACCESS or EDUCATIONAL USE. Any capacity on a cable system set
aside by a franchise for use by educational institutions.
   EQUITABLE PRICE. Fair Market Value adjusted downward for the harm to the
city or subscribers, if any, resulting from a franchisee’s or licensee’s breach
of its franchise or license, or violation of this chapter, and as further
adjusted to account for other equitable factors that may be considered
consistent with 47 U.S.C. § 547.
   FAIR MARKET VALUE. The price for the cable system valued as a going concern,
but with no value allocated to the franchise or license itself.
   GOVERNMENTAL ACCESS CHANNEL. Any capacity on a cable system set aside by a
franchise for government use.
   GROSS REVENUES. Any and all cash or other consideration of any cable
operator of a cable system in any way derived from the operation of that cable
system to provide cable services in the franchise area. GROSS REVENUES include,
by way of illustration and not limitation, monthly fees charged to subscribers
for any basic, optional, premium, per-channel or per-program service;
installation, disconnection, reconnection and change-in-service fees; leased
channel fees; late fees and administrative fees; revenues received from
programmers for carriage of programming on the cable system; revenues from
rentals or sales of converters or other equipment; advertising revenues;
revenues from program guides; and revenues from home shopping channels. This
provision shall be read broadly to prevent the avoidance of franchise fees by a
cable operator through arrangements with affiliates. GROSS REVENUES shall not
include any taxes on services furnished by a franchisee which are imposed
directly on any subscriber or user by the state, city or other governmental
unit and which are collected by a franchisee on behalf of the governmental
unit. GROSS REVENUES do not include amounts booked as revenues which are bad
subscriber debt, net of any collections. However, to take advantage of this bad
debt exception, a franchisee must exercise due diligence and utilize all
reasonable means to collect debt owed to it. Amounts received from a programmer
that are provided solely for the purpose of reimbursing the operator for
amounts the operator advanced to cover the programmer’s share of co-op
advertising costs shall not be treated as the operator’s gross revenues.
However, advertising costs subject to this exception do not include charges for
carriage of advertising on the cable system.
   NON-CABLE SERVICE. Any service that is authorized to be distributed over the
cable system, other than a cable service.
   PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNEL. Any capacity on a cable system set aside by a
franchise for use by the general public, including groups and individuals, and
which is available for the use on a non-discriminatory basis.
   SERVICE TIER. A package of two or more cable services for which a separate
charge is made by the franchisee, other than a package of premium and pay-per-
view services that is not subject to rate regulation under the Cable Act and
applicable FCC regulations because those services are also sold on a true à la
carte basis.
   SUBSCRIBER. The city, any government entity or any person who legally
receives any cable service from a cable operator delivered over that cable
operator’s cable system.
   USER. A person or the city utilizing a channel, capacity or equipment and
facilities for purposes of producing or transmitting material, as contrasted
with the receipt thereof in the capacity of a subscriber.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.31 NO EXCLUSIVITY.
   A franchisee may not require a subscriber or a building owner or manager to
enter into an exclusive contract as a condition of providing or continuing
service.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.32 RELATION TO 47 U.S.C. §§ 545—546.
   This subchapter shall be read and applied so that it is consistent with the
§§ 625 and 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. §§ 545—546.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.33 APPLICATIONS FOR GRANT, RENEWAL OR MODIFICATION OF A FRANCHISE OR

construction will begin, how it will proceed, and when it will be completed;
and the expected effect on right-of-way usage, including information on the
ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system,
including, as appropriate given the system proposed, an estimate of the
availability of space in conduits and an estimate of the cost of any necessary
rearrangement of existing facilities; and
         (d)   A description, where appropriate, of how services will be
converted from existing facilities to new facilities, and what will be done
with existing facilities.
      (4)   A demonstration of how the applicant will reasonably meet the
future cable-related needs and interests of the community, including
descriptions of the capacity, facilities and support for public, educational
and governmental use of the cable system (including institutional networks) the
applicant proposes to provide and why applicant believes that the proposal is
adequate to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community.
      (5)   A demonstration of the financial qualifications of the applicant,

authorizations from state and federal authorities;
         (b)   Has not engaged in conduct (fraud, racketeering, violation of
antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, or similar laws) that allows the city
to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with requirements of
the franchise, or provisions of this chapter;
         (c)   Is willing to enter into a franchise, to pay required
compensation and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those
relating to the construction, operation or repair of its facilities; and has
not entered into any agreement that would prevent it from doing so;
         (d)   The applicant must not have submitted an application for an
initial or renewal franchise to the city, which was denied on the ground that
the applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the cable-related needs
and interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to the
franchising decision were finally resolved (including any appeals) adversely to
the applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application;
and
         (e)   An applicant may show that it would be inappropriate to deny it
a franchise under division (B)(7)(b) above by virtue of the particular
circumstances surrounding the acts or omissions at issue; the steps taken by
the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and to prevent their
recurrence; and the lack of involvement of the applicant’s principals, or the
remoteness of the acts or omissions from the operation of communications
facilities.
      (8)   To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the
financial or technical resources of another person, including another
affiliate, the proofs required under divisions (B)(5) and (6) should be
provided for that person.
      (9)   A description of the applicant’s prior experience in cable system
ownership, construction, and operation, and an identification of cities and
counties in Kentucky in which the applicant or any of its principals have a
cable franchise or any interest therein, provided that an applicant that holds
a franchise for the city and is seeking renewal of that franchise need only
provide this information for other cities and counties in Kentucky where its
franchise had been scheduled to expire during the 12-month period prior to the
date its application is submitted to the city and for other cities and counties
in Kentucky where its franchise is scheduled to expire during the 12-month
period after the date its application is submitted to the city. If an applicant
has no other franchise in the state, it shall provide the information for its
operations in other states.
      (10)   An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer
thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application
and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law.
   (C)   Contents of applications for a license. Any application for a license
submitted pursuant to division (A) of this section shall contain, at a minimum,
the information required by division (B) of this section and such additional
information as the city may from time to time require.
   (D)   Procedure for applying for grant of a franchise other than an
application that is subject to 47 U.S.C. § 546.
      (1)   A person may apply for a franchise or license in response to a
request for proposals (“RFP”) issued by the city. Any response to an RFP shall
contain the information required by divisions (B) or (C) of this section, and
such other information as the RFP may require, and must be submitted in
accordance with the restrictions in the RFP. A properly filed response to an
RFP shall be evaluated in accordance with division (D)(2) below. The city may
conduct such investigations from time to time as may be appropriate to
establish RFP requirements.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (D)(1) above, a person
may apply for an initial franchise or license by submitting an unsolicited
application containing the information required in divisions (B) or (C) of this
section, and requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to division
(D)(3) below. Prior to evaluating that application, the city may conduct such
investigations as are necessary to determine whether the application satisfies
the standards set forth in division (D)(3) below, including by commencing a
proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and interests of the
community. It also may seek additional applications prior to evaluating the
application. An applicant for an initial franchise or license shall be provided
an opportunity to amend its application in light of the result of any
investigation conducted by the city, prior to evaluation of that application
pursuant to division (D)(3).
      (3)   In evaluating an application for a franchise or license, the city
shall consider the following factors:
         (a)   The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied
with applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise or
license for the city;
         (b)   For a franchise application, whether the quality of the
applicant’s service under any existing franchise in the city, including signal
quality, response to customer complaints, billing practices and the like, has
been reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served;
         (c)   Whether the applicant has the financial, technical and legal
qualifications to hold a cable franchise or license;
         (d)   Whether the application satisfies the requirements established
by the city under this chapter or in an RFP or is otherwise;
         (e)   For a franchise application, whether the application is
reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the
community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests;
         (f)   For a franchise application, whether, to the extent not
considered as part of division (D)(3)(e) above, the applicant will provide
adequate public, educational and governmental channel capacity, facilities or
financial support;
         (g)   Whether issuance of a franchise or license is in the public
interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-
way and private property that would be used by the cable system, including the
extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require
replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services or
use of the public rights-of-way; and the comparative superiority or inferiority
of competing applications; and
         (h)   Whether the approval of the application may eliminate or reduce
competition in the delivery of cable service in the city.
      (4)   If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a
franchise or license considering the factors set forth above, the city may
adopt a franchise ordinance or issue a license setting forth the terms and
conditions of the franchise or license, which franchise or license shall become
effective upon the satisfaction of conditions precedent to effectiveness, and
when signed and accepted by the applicant. If the city denies a franchise or
license, it will cause a written explanation of the denial to issue, which may
be in any appropriate form. Without limiting its authority to deny an
application for a franchise or license, the city specifically reserves the
right to reject any application that is incomplete or fails to respond to an
RFP.
      (5)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may reject an application
for a license if it deems it in the public interest to do so.
   (E)   Procedure for applying for grant of a Cable Act renewal franchise. To
the extent required by federal law, requests for renewal under the Cable Act
will be received and reviewed in a manner consistent with § 626 of the Cable
Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546. It is the proposal submitted by a franchisee under 47
U.S.C. § 546(b), and not the request for commencement of the renewal
proceedings submitted under 47 U.S.C. § 546(a), that must contain the
information required under division (B) of this section. If neither a renewal
applicant nor the city activates in a timely manner, or can activate the
renewal process set forth in 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)—(g) (including, for example, if
the provisions are repealed), and except as to applications submitted pursuant
to 47 U.S.C. § 546(h), the provisions of division (D) of this section shall
apply and a renewal request shall be evaluated using the same criteria as any
other request for a franchise. The City Council authorizes the Hopkinsville
Cable Television Oversight Authority (“HCTOA”) or its designee to hold any
proceedings required under federal law and to establish procedures governing
the conduct of such proceedings including, without limitation, procedures for
presentation of evidence. At the conclusion of any proceeding required by
federal law, the HCTOA shall transmit its findings, along with a
recommendation, to the City Council. If the HCTOA wishes to delegate the
conduct of the proceeding required by 47 U.S.C. § 546(c) to another entity, the
approval of the city is required. In any case, however, the final decision to
deny or grant renewal shall remain with the City Council.
   (F)   Informal applications for renewal. Notwithstanding the above, a cable
operator may submit a proposal for renewal of a franchise pursuant to 47 U.S.C.
§ 546(h). Such a proposal may be submitted at any time and the city may, after
affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny
the proposal at any time for any reason (including after proceedings have been
commenced in accordance with 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)).
   (G)   Application for modification of a franchise.
      (1)   An application for modification of a franchise shall include, at
minimum, the following information:
         (a)   The specific modification requested;
         (b)   The justification for the requested modification, including the
impact of the requested modification on subscribers and others, and the
financial impact on the applicant if the modification is approved or
disapproved, demonstrated through, inter alia, submission of pro forma
financial statements;
         (c)   A statement indicating whether the modification is sought
pursuant to § 625 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 545, and, if so, a
demonstration that the requested modification meets the standards set forth in
47 U.S.C. § 545;
         (d)   Any other information that the applicant believes is necessary
for the city to make an informed determination on the application for
modification; and
         (e)   An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or the applicant’s
authorized officer certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the
application, and certifying that the application is consistent with the
requirements of applicable law.
      (2)   A request for modification submitted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 545
shall be considered in accordance with the requirements of that section.
   (H)   Public hearings. An applicant shall be notified of any public hearings
held in connection with the evaluation of its application and shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard. In addition, prior to the issuance of a
franchise, the city shall provide for the holding of a public hearing within
the proposed franchise area, following notice to the public, at which each
applicant and its application shall be examined and the public and all
interested parties afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.34 PURCHASE OR TRANSFER OF A CABLE SYSTEM BY THE CITY.
   (A)   Expiration. If a franchise or license granted under this chapter
expires, or a licensee no longer uses its cable system to provide service, the
city may acquire ownership of or effect a transfer of the cable system as
provided herein.
   (B)   Purchase option on denial of renewal. At the expiration of the term
for which any franchise or license is granted if renewal is denied, the city,
at its election, shall have the right to purchase the cable system or any part
of it upon the payment to the franchisee or licensee of a sum equal to the fair
market value of the system or the part taken (based on system value as a going
concern) but with no value allocated to the franchise or license itself.
   (C)   Purchase option on other termination of the franchise or license. In
the event of revocation or termination of the franchise or license; except in
the circumstances described in division (B) of this section, the city at its
election, shall have the right to purchase all or any part of the cable system
upon payment to the franchisee or licensee of a sum equal to an equitable price
for the system or the part taken, with no value allocated to the franchise or
license itself.
   (D)   Exercise of the purchase option. Upon exercise of the purchase option
by the city and its service of an official notice of such action upon the
franchisee or licensee, the franchisee or licensee shall immediately transfer
to the city possession and title to all of the purchased facilities and
property, real and personal, of the cable system, free of all liens and
encumbrances; and the franchisee or licensee shall execute the warranty deeds
or other instruments of conveyance to the city as shall be reasonably necessary
for this purpose. Each contract entered into by a franchisee or licensee with
reference to its system or operations under the franchise or license shall be
subject to the exercise of this option by the city.
   (E)   City rights in the event of abandonment. Notwithstanding the above, if
a cable system or any part of a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee or
licensee during the franchise or license term, or if the franchisee fails to
operate its system in accordance with this chapter during any transition
period, or the franchisee or licensee otherwise terminates its franchise or
license, upon reasonable notice of at least 30 days and an opportunity to be
heard, the ownership of the cable system or the abandoned portions thereof in
public rights-of-ways shall revert to the city and the city may sell, assign or
transfer all or part of the assets of the system, or the City Council, at its
option, may use or dispose of the system as it sees fit. The franchisee or
licensee shall execute the quit claim deeds and other documents as may be
necessary to transfer the system or affected part thereof free and clear of
liens and encumbrances to the city. Each contract entered into by a franchisee
or licensee with reference to its system or operations under the franchise or
license shall be subject to the exercise of this right.
   (F)   No effect on the powers of eminent domain. Nothing herein in any
respect affects the city’s powers of eminent domain, or its right to exercise
these powers with respect to a cable system.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.35 CONSTRUCTION PROVISIONS.
   (A)   System construction schedule. Every franchise or license shall specify
the construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade
or rebuild of the cable system. The schedule shall provide for prompt
completion of the project, considering the amount and type of construction
required.
   (B)   Use of franchisee or licensee facilities. The city shall have the
right to install and maintain, free of charge upon any poles or in any conduit
owned by a franchisee or licensee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not
unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of the franchisee or
licensee; provided that, if a franchisee is authorized to erect poles or place
conduit, and the city uses a franchisee’s conduit or poles to install a cable
system that competes with that franchisee in the provision of cable service to
residential subscribers, the franchise may provide that the franchisee may
charge the city a fair market rate pursuant to that franchise for the use of
the poles or conduit to provide residential cable service. A franchisee or
licensee shall notify the city when it enters into an agreement for the use of
its poles and conduits. Copies of agreements for use of a franchisee’s or
licensee’s conduits or poles in the public rights-of-way or on other public
property shall be available for review upon the city’s request.
   (C)   Provision of service/quality of service. In addition to satisfying
such requirements as may be established in a franchise, every cable operator
holding a franchise shall operate its cable system subject to the following
conditions, except as prohibited by federal law.
      (1)   It is the policy of the city to ensure that every franchisee
provides service in the franchise area upon request to any person or any
government building. Each franchisee shall extend service upon request within
its franchise area; provided that, a franchise may permit a franchisee to
require a potential subscriber to contribute a fair share of the capital costs
of installation or extension as a condition of extension or installation in
cases where the extension or installation may be unduly expensive. Service must
be provided within the time limits specified in division (C)(2) below.
      (2)   Except as a franchise otherwise provides, a franchisee must extend
service to any person or to any government building in the franchise area which
requests it:
         (a)   Within seven days of the request, where service can be provided
by activating or installing a drop;
         (b)   Within 90 days of the request where an extension of one-half
mile or less is required; or
         (c)   Within six months where an extension of one-half mile or more is
required. Provided that, in cases where a franchise permits a franchisee to
require a potential subscriber to bear a share of extension or installation
costs, and the franchisee requires the potential subscriber to bear the costs,
the time for extension shall be measured from the date the subscriber agrees to
bear the costs or, if a franchisee requires prepayment of all or a portion of
the estimated costs, from the date the prepayment is made. A franchisee that
requires a potential subscriber to bear a portion of installation or extension
costs must prepare a written estimate of extension costs within seven days of a
request for an installation or extension that would be subject to cost-sharing.
      (3)   A franchisee’s cable system within the city shall at least meet the
technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. §§ 76.601 et seq., and any other
applicable technical standards.
      (4)   A franchisee shall perform all tests necessary to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of the franchise and other technical and
performance standards established by applicable law. Unless a franchise or
applicable law provides otherwise, all tests shall be conducted in accordance
with federal rules and in accordance with the most recent edition of the
National Cable Television Association’s Recommended Practices for Measurements
on Cable Television Systems or such other manual as may be directed under FCC
regulations. A written report of any test results shall be filed with the city
within seven days of a request by the city. If a location fails to meet
technical or performance specifications, the franchisee, without requirement of
additional notice or request from city, shall promptly take corrective action
and retest the locations.
      (5)   Upon request of the city, every cable operator shall be required to
interconnect with every other cable system and cable operator within the city,
on fair and reasonable terms, for purposes of providing PEG and institutional
network services.
   (D)   System maintenance. Scheduled maintenance shall be performed by a
franchised cable operator so as to minimize the effect of any necessary
interruptions of cable service.
   (E)   Continuity of service. Each franchisee shall, during the term of the
franchise, ensure that subscribers are able to receive continuous service. In
the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the franchisee may be
required to continue to provide service for a reasonable period to assure an
orderly transition of service from the franchisee to another entity. A
franchise may establish more particular requirements under which these
obligations will be satisfied.

chapter.
   (B)   Reports.
      (1)   If the city should request it, a franchisee shall submit a report

appropriate electronic measurements to show conformity with FCC technical
standards;
         (i)   A report showing, for each cable customer service standard in
force, the franchisee’s performance with respect to that standard for each
quarter of the preceding year. In each case where a franchisee concludes it did
not comply fully, the franchisee will describe the corrective actions it is
taking to assure future compliance; and
         (j)   Notwithstanding the above, once the information required by
divisions (B)(2)(e) through (g) above has been filed once, it need only be

information required by division (B)(2)(h) above, except that it need not
provide information regarding its operations outside the city.

about any aspect of the cable system or a franchisee’s operations, including,
without limitation, complaints requiring service calls and complaints about
employee courtesy, billing, prices, programming, outages and signal quality;
provided that, records of billing complaints that are resolved to the
subscriber’s satisfaction on the first call need not be maintained;
      (2)   Records of outages known to the franchisee, with information
sufficient to allow a franchisee to prepare the reports required in this
section;
      (3)   Records of service calls for repairs and maintenance indicating the

(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.37 RATE REGULATION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION.
   (A)   Scope and applicability. The city reserves all rights to implement and
impose regulation of a franchisee’s rates and charges, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, and may do so by amendment to this chapter, by separate
ordinance, by amendment to a franchise, or in any other lawful manner.
   (B)   Rate regulation procedures. Rate regulation shall be performed in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the FCC. The CAO or his or her
designee may take any required steps to file complaints, toll rates, issue
accounting orders or take any other steps required to comply with FCC
regulations. The City Council shall be responsible for issuing final rate
orders that establish rates or order refunds. No rate may be put into effect
without the prior review and approval of the city, except as federal law may
otherwise require.
   (C)   Rate discrimination prohibited. Except to the extent the city may not
enforce such a requirement, a franchisee is prohibited from discriminating in
its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber,
potential subscriber or group of subscribers or potential subscribers;
provided, however, that, a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide
promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as
such discounts are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to similar classes of
subscribers throughout the franchise area; provided further that, a franchisee
may offer discounts for the elderly, the disabled or the economically
disadvantaged and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide
under federal law, if the discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent
manner. A franchisee shall comply at all times with all applicable federal,
state and city laws, and all executive and administrative orders relating to
non-discrimination.
   (D)   Cable customer service standards. Each franchisee must satisfy cable
customer service standards or consumer protection standards set out in
Appendix A to this chapter and its franchise agreement. In addition, every
franchise shall be deemed to include a requirement that the franchisee comply
with such additional or stricter customer service standards or consumer
protection laws as the city may establish from time to time by ordinance or
resolution. In addition to complying with the requirements of its franchise and
applicable municipal law, each franchisee shall at all times satisfy any
additional or stricter requirements established by applicable law including,
without limitation, FCC customer service standards and consumer protection
laws.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.38 FRANCHISE OR LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   Amount of franchise fee. Subject to the exception in §
100.39(F), a franchisee shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount
equal to 3% of its annual gross revenues and every franchise shall reserve the
right to increase this fee to the maximum that may be charged consistent with
state and federal law.
   (B)   Amount of license fee. Subject to the exception in §
100.39(F), a licensee shall pay to the city a license fee that recovers an
amount equivalent to the fair market value of the property used in the city. No
license may be issued without an enforceable fee.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.39 TRANSFERS.
   (A)   City approval required. No transfer shall occur without prior written
notice to and approval of the City Council. A transfer without the prior
written approval of the city shall be considered to impair the city’s assurance
of due performance. The granting of approval for a transfer in one instance
shall not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent transfer.
   (B)   Application.
      (1)   The franchisee or licensee shall promptly notify the city of any
proposed transfer. If any transfer should take place without prior notice to
the city, the franchisee or licensee will promptly notify the city that such a
transfer has occurred.
      (2)   At least 120 calendar days prior to the contemplated effective date
of a transfer, the franchisee or licensee shall submit to the city an
application for approval of the transfer. Such an application shall provide
complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the
legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the transferee, and on
the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber service. At a minimum, the
following information must be included in the application; provided that, a
franchisee or licensee is not required to duplicate information that it submits
to the city to comply with its obligations under federal or state law:
         (a)   All information and forms required under federal law or the
equivalent of the forms if no longer required by federal law;
         (b)   All information required in §
100.33(B)(1), and §
100.33(B)(5) through (10), in the case of a proposed franchise transfer, or all
of the information required in §
100.33(B), in the case of a proposed license transfer;
         (c)   Any contracts or other documents that relate to the proposed
transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits or the like referred to
therein;
         (d)   Any shareholder reports or filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that discuss the transaction;
         (e)   Other information necessary to provide a complete and accurate
understanding of the financial position of the cable system before and after
the proposed transfer;
         (f)   For a proposed franchise transfer, complete information
regarding any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber service; and
         (g)   A brief summary of the proposed transferee’s plans for at least
the next two years regarding line extension, plant and equipment upgrades,
channel capacity, expansion or elimination of services and any other changes
affecting or enhancing the performance of the cable system. A licensee shall
provide information regarding its plans for changes to its plant within the
city.
      (3)   For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a
transfer, the city or its agents may inquire into all qualifications of the
prospective transferee and such other matters as the city may deem necessary to
determine whether the transfer is in the public interest and should be
approved, denied, or conditioned as provided under division (C) below. The
franchisee or licensee and any prospective transferees shall assist the city in
any such inquiry, and if they fail to do so, the request for a transfer may be
denied.
   (C)   Determination by city. In making a determination as to whether to
grant, deny or grant subject to conditions, an application for a transfer of a
franchise, the city shall consider the legal, financial, and technical
qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system; any potential
impact of the transfer on subscriber services; whether the incumbent cable
operator is in compliance with its franchise, and this chapter and, if not, the
proposed transferee’s commitment to cure the noncompliance; whether the
transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the city, and whether
operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery
of cable service in the city; and whether operation by the transferee or
approval of the transfer would adversely affect subscribers, the public, or the
city’s interest under this chapter, the franchise or other applicable law. An
application for a transfer of a license may be denied for any reason where the
city determines that it is in the public interest to do so.
   (D)   Transferee’s agreement. No application for a transfer of a franchise
or license shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it
will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise or
license, and that it will assume the obligations, liabilities and
responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous
franchisee or licensee under this chapter and the franchise or license, for all
purposes, including renewal, unless the city, in its sole discretion, expressly
waives this requirement in whole or in part.
   (E)   Approval does not constitute waiver. Approval by the city of a
transfer of a franchise or license does not constitute a waiver or release of
any of the rights of the city under this chapter, or a franchise or license,
whether arising before or after the date of the transfer.
   (F)   Exception for intra-company transfers. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a franchise or license may provide that transfers to affiliates of a franchisee
or licensee shall be excepted from the requirements of divisions (A) and (B)
where the affiliate is wholly-owned and managed by an entity that will
guarantee the performance under a franchise or license and the transferee
affiliate:
      (1)   Notifies the city of the transfer at least 60 days before it occurs
and, at that time provides the agreements and warranties required by this
section, describes the nature of the transfer and submits complete information
describing who will have direct and indirect ownership and control of the cable
system after the transfer;
      (2)   Warrants that it has read, accepts and agrees to be bound by each
and every term of the franchise or license and related amendments, regulations,
ordinances and resolutions then in effect;
      (3)   Agrees to assume all responsibility for all liabilities, acts and
omissions, known and unknown, of its predecessor franchisee(s) or licensee(s),
for all purposes, including renewal;
      (4)   Agrees that the transfer shall not permit it to take any position
or exercise any right which could not have been exercised by its predecessor
franchisee(s) or licensee(s);
      (5)   Warrants that the transfer will not substantially increase the
financial burdens upon or substantially diminish the financial resources
available to the franchisee or licensee (the warranty to be based on comparing
the burdens upon and resources that will be available to the transferee
compared to its predecessors), or otherwise adversely affect the ability of the
franchisee or licensee to perform;
      (6)   Warrants that the transfer will not in any way adversely affect the
city or subscribers (including by increasing rates);
      (7)   Notifies the city that the transfer is complete within five
business days of the date the transfer is completed; and
      (8)   Agrees that the transfer in no way affects any evaluation of its
legal, financial or technical qualifications that may occur under the franchise
or license, or applicable law after the transfer, and does not directly or
indirectly authorize any additional transfers.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.40 CONNECTIONS TO CABLE SYSTEM; USE OF ANTENNAE.
   (A)   Subscriber right to attach. To the extent consistent with federal law,
subscribers shall have the right to attach VCRs, receivers and other terminal
equipment to a franchisee’s cable system. Subscribers shall also have the right
to use their own remote control devices and converters and other similar
equipment.
   (B)   Removal of existing antennae. A franchisee shall not, as a condition
of providing service, require a subscriber or potential subscriber to remove
any existing antenna, or to disconnect an antenna except at the express
direction of the subscriber or potential subscriber; provided that, the antenna
is connected with an appropriate device and complies with applicable law.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997)
§ 100.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter shall be enforced by the Code of
Ordinance Enforcement Board as established by Ord. 24-2004 and as codified as
§§
33.180 through
33.193 of this code.
   (B)   The civil penalties for violation of ordinances and agreements
regulating cable television franchises shall be as set forth in §§
33.192 and
33.193 of this code.
(Ord. 26-97, passed 9-23-1997; Ord. 35-2005, passed 12-20-2005)
APPENDIX A: CABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS FOR FRANCHISED CABLE TELEVISION
SYSTEMS
1   Standards
2   Relation to other standards
§ 1 STANDARDS.
   These standards apply to any franchised cable operator.
   (A)   Telephone and office availability.
      (1)   (a)   Each franchisee shall maintain an office at a location
convenient to subscribers and shall establish a telephone service adequate to
respond to subscriber inquiries. Every franchisee must at least satisfy the
minimum requirements established by the Federal Communications Commission. Each
franchisee shall maintain an office and telephone service in accordance with a
written plan submitted by the franchisee and approved by the Hopkinsville Cable
Television Oversight Authority (“HCTOA”). Failure on the part of any franchisee
to have and conform to an approved plan shall constitute a substantial
violation of its franchise. A franchisee may propose new plans as often as
practical, however, the HCTOA reserves the right to reject any proposal
submitted.
         (b)   Each franchisee shall perform service calls, installations and
disconnects at least ten hours per day, Monday through Saturday (except legal
holidays); provided that, a franchisee shall respond to outages 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. Each franchisee shall establish a publicly listed local
toll-free telephone number. The phone must be answered by customer service
representatives during normal business hours, Monday through Saturday (except
legal holidays), for the purpose of receiving requests for service, inquiries
and complaints from subscribers. After such business hours, the phone shall be
answered so that customers can register complaints and report service problems
on a 24-hour per day, seven-day per week basis, and so that the franchisee can
respond to service outages as required herein. Phones shall be answered in
accordance with this division (A). Telephone answering time shall not exceed 30
seconds or four rings and the time to transfer the call to a customer service
representative (including hold time) shall not exceed an additional 30 seconds.
Under normal operating conditions, this standard shall be met 90% of the time,
measured quarterly. Under normal operating conditions, customers will receive a
busy signal less than 3% of the time. When the business office is closed, an
answering machine or service capable of receiving and recording service
complaints and inquiries shall be employed. The after-hours answering service
shall comply with the same telephone answer time standard set forth in this
section.
   (B)   Scheduling work.
      (1)   All appointments for service, installation or disconnection shall
be specified by date. Each franchisee shall specify a specific time at which
the work shall be done, or offer a choice of time blocks, which shall not
exceed two hours in length. A franchisee may also, upon request, schedule
service installation calls outside normal business hours, for the express
convenience of the customer. If at any time an installer or technician is
running late for an appointment and believes it will not be able to make a
scheduled appointment time, an attempt to contact the customer will be made
prior to the time of appointment and the appointment rescheduled at a time
convenient to the customer, if rescheduling is necessary. It is the operator’s
burden to prove it met the appointment.
      (2)   The franchisee shall offer and fully describe to subscribers who
have experienced a missed appointment (where the missed appointment was not the
subscriber’s fault) that the subscriber may choose between the following
options: installation or service call free of charge; or one month of the most
widely subscribed to service tier free of charge.
      (3)   With regard to disabled or handicapped customers, upon subscriber
request, each franchisee shall arrange for pickup and/or replacement of
converters or other franchisee equipment at the subscriber’s address or by a
satisfactory equivalent (such as the provision of a postage-prepaid mailer).
      (4)   Under normal operating conditions, requests for service, repair and
maintenance must be acknowledged by a trained customer service representative
within 24 hours, or prior to the end of the next business day, whichever is
earlier. A franchisee shall respond to all other inquiries (including billing
inquiries) within five business days of the inquiry or complaint. Under normal
operating conditions, work on outages or service interruptions must begin
immediately. Repairs and maintenance for outages or service interruptions must
be completed as soon as possible, and within four hours after the outage or
interruption becomes known to the franchisee where the franchisee has adequate
access to facilities to which it must have access in order to remedy the
problem. Under normal operating conditions, work to correct all other service
problems must be begun by the next business day after notification of the
service problem and must be completed within five business days from the date
of the initial request. When normal operating conditions do not exist, a
franchisee shall complete the work in the shortest time possible. The failure
of the franchisee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff shall
not justify a franchisee’s failure to comply with this provision.
      (5)   A franchisee shall not cancel a service or installation appointment
with a customer after the close of business on the business day preceding the
scheduled appointment.
      (6)   Under normal operating conditions, the standards of divisions (B)
(4) and (5) of this section shall be met at least 95% of the time, measured on
a quarterly basis.
      (7)   Under normal operating conditions, the installation time standard
in § 100.35, and below will be met no less than 95% of the time measured on a
quarterly basis. Requests for additional outlets, service upgrades or other
connections (e.g., DMX, VCR, A/B switch) separate from the initial installation
will be performed within seven business days after an order has been placed.
   (C)   Notice to subscribers.
      (1)   At the time service is installed, a franchisee shall provide each
subscriber with clear and accurate written information on: the procedure for
placing a service call, filing a complaint or requesting an adjustment
(including when a subscriber is entitled to refunds for outages and how to
obtain them); showing the telephone number of the city office responsible for
administering the franchise; the availability of parental control devices; the
franchisee’s delinquent subscriber disconnect and reconnect policies; and any
other of the franchisee’s policies in connection with its subscribers. A
franchisee shall also provide subscribers with a schedule of rates and charges,
channel positions and services provided, as well as a copy of the service
contract. The same information shall be provided to the subscriber annually
thereafter, except another copy of the service contract need not be provided.
Copies of the notices provided to the subscribers shall be provided to the
city. Except as applicable federal, state and local rate regulations may
provide to the contrary, a franchisee shall provide the CAO at least 60-days’
notice and all subscribers at least 30-days’ notice of any significant changes
in the information required to be provided under this division. The notice
shall be made in writing.
      (2)   Each franchisee shall take appropriate steps to ensure that all
written franchisee promotional materials, announcements and advertising of
residential cable service to subscribers and the general public, where price
information is listed in any manner, clearly and accurately discloses price
terms. In the case of telephone orders, a franchisee shall take appropriate
steps to ensure that price terms are clearly and accurately disclosed to
potential customers in advance of taking the order. The franchisee must advise
potential subscribers that they may purchase a basic service tier and must
disclose the price therefor. If there is a downgrade charge to shift to basic
service from other service tiers, that downgrade charge must be disclosed to
the subscriber before the subscriber takes service. No charge may be levied
which has not been properly disclosed.
      (3)   Each franchisee shall maintain a file open for public inspection
containing all notices provided to subscribers under these customer service
standards, as well as all promotional offers made to subscribers. The notices
and offers shall be kept in the file for at least one year from the date of the
notice or promotional offer.
   (D)   Interruptions of service. A franchisee shall provide 48 hours prior
notice to subscribers and the city before interrupting service for planned
maintenance or construction; provided, however, that planned maintenance that
does not require more than two hours interruption of service, and that occurs
between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m., shall not require such
notice to subscribers, however, notice to the city must be given no less than
24 hours prior to the anticipated service interruption.
   (E)   Billing.
      (1)   A franchisee’s first billing statement after a new installation or
service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security
deposit.
      (2)   A franchisee’s billing statement must be clear, concise and
understandable, must itemize each category of service and equipment provided to
the subscriber, and must state clearly the charge therefor.
      (3)   A franchisee’s billing statement must show a specific payment due
date not earlier than the later of:
         (a)   Fifteen days after the date the statement is mailed; or
         (b)   The fifteenth day of the 30-day period in which the service
being billed is rendered. A late fee or administrative fee may not be imposed
for payments before the end of the period for which the payment is rendered.
         (c)   Subscribers shall not be charged a late fee or otherwise
penalized for any failure by a franchisee, including failure to timely or
correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber for
a payment timely made.
      (4)   A franchisee’s bill must permit a subscriber to remit payment by
mail or in person at the franchisee’s local office.
      (5)   The account of any subscriber shall be credited a prorated share of
the monthly charge for the service upon subscriber request, if a subscriber is
without service or if service is substantially impaired for any reason for a
period exceeding four hours during any 24-hour period; or automatically if the
loss of service or impairment is for 24 hours or longer; except where it can be
documented that a subscriber will obtain a refund for a loss of service or
impairment which was caused by the subscriber or by subscriber-owned equipment
(not including, for purposes of this section, in-home wiring installed by the
franchisee).
      (6)   A franchisee shall respond to all written billing complaints from
subscribers within 30 days.
      (7)   Refunds to subscribers shall be issued no later than:
         (a)   The earlier of the subscriber’s next billing cycle following
resolution of the refund request or 30 days; or
         (b)   Within 30 days the date of return of all equipment to
franchisee, if cable service has been terminated.
      (8)   Credits for cable service shall be issued no later than the
subscriber’s next billing cycle after the determination that the credit is
warranted.
   (F)   Disconnection/downgrades.
      (1)   A subscriber may terminate service at any time.
      (2)   A franchisee shall promptly disconnect from the franchisee’s cable
system or downgrade any subscriber who so requests. No period of notice prior
to voluntary termination or downgrade of cable service may be required of
subscribers by any franchisee. Charges for any voluntary disconnection, and any
downgrade charges shall conform to applicable law.
      (3)   Any security deposit and/or other funds due a subscriber that
disconnects or downgrades service shall be returned to the subscriber within 30
days or in the next billing cycle, whichever is later, from the date the
disconnection or the downgrade was requested, except in cases where the
subscriber does not permit the franchisee to recover its equipment, in which
case the amounts owed shall be paid to subscribers within 30 days of the date
the equipment was recovered, or in the next billing cycle, whichever is later.
      (4)   A franchisee may not disconnect a subscriber’s cable service for
non-payment unless:
         (a)   The subscriber is delinquent in payment for cable service;
         (b)   A separate, written notice of impending disconnection, postage
prepaid, has been sent to the subscriber at least 20 days prior to the date on
which service may be disconnected, at the premises where the subscriber
requests billing, which notice must state the date by which disconnection may
occur and the amount the subscriber must pay to avoid disconnection;
         (c)   The subscriber has failed to pay the amounts owed to avoid
disconnection by the date of disconnection;
         (d)   No pending inquiry exists regarding the bill to which franchisee
has not responded in writing; and
         (e)   Payment is not delinquent until the fifteenth day of the month
in which the service being billed for is rendered; the notice required under
division (F)(4)(b) above may not be sent to a subscriber prior to the
delinquency date. If the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late
charges, before the date scheduled for disconnection, the franchisee shall not
disconnect service. After lawful disconnection (except in cases where

§ 110.05 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, net profits shall
be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the net profits by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) of this section and
the denominator of which is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profits by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) of this section.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sales, lease or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this division,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, corporations and all other entities where income is
"passed through" to the owners are subject to this subchapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this subchapter is assessed against income before it is
"passed through" these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this subchapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by
the federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting
required for federal income tax purposes.

withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.

to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under this
section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld to
the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational
license tax withheld where compensation is paid or payable to employees. Either
copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax statements, or
a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the city, shall be submitted.

deducted and withheld under this section.
   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this section shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided, the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and every
person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
division unless the person had authority to collect, truthfully account for, or
pay over the tax imposed by this subchapter at the time the taxes imposed by
this subchapter become or became due.
   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H) of this section, every employee
receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
110.04 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the tax levied under this subchapter from the
employee, the employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the
city each quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer.

previously filed. The city may also require copies of reports of adjustments
made by the federal government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this subchapter, including those with gross receipts less
than $25,000, shall keep records, render oath statements, make returns and
comply with rules as the city from time to time may prescribe. Whenever the
city deems it necessary, the city may require a business entity, by notice
served to the business entity, to make a return, render statements under oath
or keep records, as the city deems sufficient to determine the tax liability of
the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the taxable income
of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business
entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.

based on their consolidated federal tax return or the activities of the
subsidiary only. Once the initial election is made, the same method of
reporting must be used each year.

information may have to do with the affairs of the person's business. This
prohibition does not extend to information required in prosecutions for making
false reports or returns for taxation, or any other infraction of the tax laws,

of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or his or her duly authorized agent all such
information and rights to inspect any of the books and records of the city if

the reciprocal right to obtain information from the files and records of the
Kentucky Department of Revenue and maintains the privileged character of the
information so furnished. Provided, further, that, the city may publish
statistics based on such information in such a manner as not to reveal data
respecting net profits or compensation of any person.
   (C)   In addition, the city is empowered to execute similar reciprocity
agreements as described in division (B) of this section with any other taxing
entity, should there be a need for exchange of information in order to effect
diligent enforcement of this subchapter.

      (2)   It shall be the duty of every licensee to keep and preserve for a
period of not less than three years the books and records necessary to compute
its tax liability. If a licensee fails to keep the records, the Chief Financial
Officer shall make his or her own determination of that licensee's tax
liability from the information available to him or her.
      (3)   The license issued by the city to a business or manufacturer shall
be placed conspicuously in the place of business. Where no permanent place of
business exists, the license shall be placed where there is reasonable and free
access to the license by the Chief Financial Officer.
   (C)   Examination of books, records or person.
      (1)   The Chief Financial Officer for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any license application or for the purpose of making an estimate
of any license fee, may examine any books, papers, records or memoranda,
including state and federal income returns, and state sales tax returns bearing
upon the matter and may require the attendance of a person required to be
licensed under this subchapter or officer, agent or any other person having
knowledge in the premises, and may take testimony and require proof material
for the information with power to administer oaths to such persons. The Chief
Financial Officer shall have authority, by notice mailed to the last known
address of a person required to be licensed under this subchapter, to require
the production, at any reasonable time and place it may designate, of any
books, papers, accounts or other information necessary to the carrying out of
the licensing requirements imposed by this subchapter.
      (2)   Any person willingly and knowingly filing a fraudulent return or
application as required by this subchapter, or who shall refuse to permit the
examination of records as prescribed by this section shall be subject to the
penalties set forth in this subchapter.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to examine all internal and available
state and federal records for the present taxing year as well as the two
previous taxing years, and any business who has failed to pay to the city the
correct license fees for any of those years shall be deemed in violation and
subject to remit to the city the correct amount as well as any fines or
penalties determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   Refusal, revocation and suspension.
      (1)   The Chief Financial Officer shall refuse to issue a license or may
revoke or suspend a license for any of the following reasons:
         (a)   The applicant misrepresents a fact relevant to the amount of tax
due or his qualifications as a licensee;
         (b)   The applicant refuses to provide the information necessary to
compute the amount of tax due;
         (c)   If it shall be found that any condition, conduct, or activity
exists, existed, or is or was carried on at the premises covered by the license
in violation of any provisions of this or any ordinance of this city; of any
statutes of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or the United States; constitutes a
nuisance or detriment to the moral or general welfare of this community; and
         (d)   A license shall not be issued to any person, which by virtue of
his or her nature and location, would be in violation of the city's Zoning
Ordinance.
      (2)   Upon proof of any of the above violations, the initial refusal of
the license shall be upheld and a suspension of license may be expanded to a
revocation of same.
      (3)   After receipt of completed application, if the Chief Financial
Officer believes that reason exists for refusing the applicant a license, under
this section, he or she shall refuse to accept payment and shall not issue the
license. At the applicant's request, the Chief Financial Officer shall give the
applicant a written statement of the reasons for refusal. The applicant may
then, within ten days of receipt of this statement, request a conference with
the Chief Financial Officer to discuss the case. In the request, the applicant
shall specify why his or her application should not be refused. The Chief
Financial Officer shall arrange a conference within a reasonable time. If the
license is refused after conference, the applicant may reapply at any time,
thereafter. If reason no longer exists to refuse the application, the Chief
Financial Officer shall collect the fee and issue the license.
   (E)   Violation not excused by compliance. It is not a defense in any
prosecution or imposition of fines pertaining to violation of any provision of
this subchapter, that the defendant has subsequently complied with the
provisions hereof, nor does a conviction of any such violation exempt a person
from a payment of any license fees, penalties or interest charges imposed due
and unpaid at the time of conviction.
(Ord. 16-2007, passed 6-19-2007)
§ 110.15 BOARD OF APPEALS.
   A licensee shall have the right to appeal audit findings or an additional
assessment within 30 days from notification to the licensee of the audit
results by sending a written notice, including sufficient documentation to
support the appeal, to the Chief Financial Officer. Upon receipt of the notice
of appeal, the Chief Financial Officer shall submit the appeal to the Board of
Appeals ("the Board"). The Board shall consist of the City Administrative
Officer or his or her designee, the City Attorney or Assistant City Attorney, a
Council person as appointed by the Mayor for a two-year term, a CPA as
appointed by the Mayor for a two-year term, and a representative from the
Chamber of Commerce as designated by its Board of Directors to serve a two-year
term. The City Administrative Officer, or his or her designee, shall serve as
Chairperson of the Board, and the City Attorney or Assistant City Attorney
shall serve as Vice Chair. Any member of the Board may elect to excuse himself
or herself if they deem his or her participation in hearing a case on appeal
creates a conflict of interest for any reason. Should any member of the Board
have a direct financial interest in the outcome of the case, or any type of
family relationship to the licensee (party appealing the assessment), then that
Board member shall automatically be excused from hearing the case. The Board
shall be convened by the City Administrative Officer, or his or her designee,
to hear cases presented on appeal at a time of his or her choosing, but in no
event longer than 30 days from the date the licensee files a written notice of
appeal. The licensee shall have the opportunity to present their case by way of
testimony, argument and documentation at the hearing. In turn, the Chief
Financial Officer shall be afforded the same opportunity. After hearing all the
evidence presented, the Board shall make findings to confirm, modify or
withdraw the original assessment within ten days of the date of the meeting.
All decisions of the Board shall be voted upon by its members and shall be
controlled by a simple majority of the members present. The Chairperson (or
Vice Chairperson acting as Chairperson) shall only vote in the event of a tie.
All decisions of the Board shall be considered final.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 112.01 RESERVED.
RATE REGULATIONS
§ 112.30 ESTABLISHMENT.
   The authority and procedures to allow for local regulation of basic cable
television rates and charges in the city is hereby established and created as
set forth in this subchapter.
(Ord. 31-93, passed 12-21-1993)
§ 112.31 RATES SUBJECT TO LOCAL REGULATION.
   Rates subject to regulation by the city include rates for the basic cable
television service plus the leased equipment necessary for the rendition of
basic service (including converter boxes, remote control units and wiring) and
installation and extra set charges.
(Ord. 31-93, passed 12-21-1993)
§ 112.32 RATE CHANGES; DISCRIMINATION.
   (A)   Unless approved by the city and to the extent consistent with federal
law, no franchisee may in its rates or charges, or in the availability of the
services or facilities of its system, or in any other respect, make or grant
undue preferences or advantages to any subscriber or potential subscriber to
the system, including preferences based on the geographic location of the
subscriber, or to any user or potential user of the system, nor subject any
such persons to any undue prejudice or any disadvantage. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a franchisee may afford reasonable discounts for senior citizens and
other economically disadvantaged groups.
   (B)   Rates may be changed by the franchisee following a minimum 30-days'
prior notice to the city and the subscribers.
(Ord. 31-93, passed 12-21-1993)
§ 112.33 RATE REGULATION.
   (A)   Upon certification of the city by the FCC to institute rate
regulation, the following procedures shall apply to those rates that are
subject to local regulation.
      (1)   When the city, on recommendation from the city's Cable Television
Oversight Authority, desires to initially review the basic service rates and
other rates subject to local regulation under federal law, it shall notify the
franchisee to file its schedule of rates with the city's Cable Television
Oversight Authority within 30 days of the receipt of the notice, together with
the data and information necessary to determine whether the rates meet the FCC
rate standards. The supporting information shall include, at minimum, the
completed worksheets of FCC Form 393 and all relevant supporting information
and notes.
      (2)   When the franchisee desires to increase rates subsequent to the
initial rate review, it shall submit to the city's Cable Television Oversight
Authority the revised rate schedule, together with data and supporting
information necessary to determine whether the new rates meet the FCC rate
standards. Before filing for the rate increases, the franchisee shall give
notice to its subscribers as required herein, and by FCC rules.
      (3)   If the city's Cable Television Oversight Authority finds that the
rates submitted by the franchisee are consistent with FCC rate standards, it
shall so notify the franchisee within 30 days of the filing of the rates, and
any rate increases will become effective on the thirty-first day after the
filing. If the Authority finds the rates are not reasonable under the FCC
standards within the 30-day period, it shall so notify the franchisee and may
issue a brief order postponing the effectiveness of any rate increases for up
to an additional 90 days; however, if the franchisee is depending on a "cost of
service" study to demonstrate reasonableness, the Authority may postpone the
effectiveness of any rate increase for up to an additional 150 days.
   (B)   Members of the public and other interested parties may file written
comments with the city's Cable Television Oversight Authority within 14 days of
the date a franchisee files its rates for initial review or for review of a
rate increase. The authority shall schedule a public hearing on rates before it
for review following appropriate advance announcement to the public and the
franchisee. The hearing may be before to Mayor and City Council, or it may
delegate the Authority to make public testimony and report to the Mayor and
City Council. Whenever the Mayor and City Council disapprove rates or rate
increases, in whole or in part, or approve rates over the objections of
interested parties, they shall do so by written order explaining their reasons
and provide public notice thereof.
(Ord. 31-93, passed 12-21-1993)
§ 112.34 REMEDIES.
   Whenever the Mayor and City Council disapprove a schedule of rates upon
initial review or subsequent rate increases, they may employ any combination of
the following remedies:
   (A)   A prospective reduction in rates may be ordered consistent with FCC
rate standards or the results of a cost of service study;
   (B)   New rates may be prescribed by the city upon recommendation of the
city's Cable Television Oversight Authority, to bring rates found to be
unreasonable into compliance with FCC rate standards or a cost of service
study;
   (C)   Upon recommendation of the city's Cable Television Oversight
Authority, the city may, consistent with division (D) of this section, order
the franchisee to refund to subscribers an amount by which rates are found to
be unreasonable under any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   As part of the initial review of rates;
      (2)   When the franchisee has failed to comply with a rate decision and
has continued to charge unreasonable rates; and/or
      (3)   Where the city has tolled a prospective rate increase for 90 to 150
additional days (as applicable) and the rate increase, later found to be
unreasonable, has gone into effect.
   (D)   When refunds may become applicable under division (C) of this section,
the city shall issue a brief order when the tolled rates go into effect
directing the franchisee to keep accurate account of all amounts paid by
individual subscribers relative to the rates in question (an "accounting
order"). The period for which refunds may be ordered shall not exceed one year
or extend back in time before September 1, 1993, whichever period is less.
Before ordering a refund, the city must give the franchisee prior notice and an
opportunity to make a presentation, either orally in a hearing context or by
paper filings. Refunds shall include interest computed at the rate used by the
Internal Revenue Service for refunds and additional tax payments. Normally,
refunds shall be made to individual subscribers that paid the unreasonable
charges. However, where no accounting order has been issued or the franchisee
can demonstrate that the specific refunds will entail undue burden compared
with the amount of the refund, the city may authorize a one-time credit to all
subscribers of the class that paid the unreasonable rates.
(Ord. 31-93, passed 12-21-1993)
§ 112.35 CONFLICTS AND INTERPRETATIONS.
   If any provision in this subchapter shall be determined to be in conflict
with a rule, regulation, policy or order of the FCC, then in that circumstance
the FCC requirement shall take precedence over the requirement of this section.
If any requirement of this section shall have ambiguity in interpretation or in
applicability, it shall be interpreted in a way that is consistent with FCC
rules, requirements and opinions.

§ 116.03 RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF FRANCHISEE.
   The franchise granted by the city is subject to the provisions and
limitations set out in the HCO
Chapter 100 (including the limitations herein) and other applicable law, and is
expressly conditioned on the franchisee's compliance with applicable federal,
state and local laws. The franchise does not convey equitable or legal title in
the public rights-of-way. The right granted is only the right to occupy public
rights-of-way for the purposes and for the period stated in the franchise. The
right is non-exclusive and may not be subdivided or subleased. It is a
privilege held in public trust and is personal to the franchisee. The franchise
and this chapter shall be interpreted in a manner that conforms to the
requirements of the Hopkinsville Code of Ordinances; deems to include all the
provisions required to be in a franchise under the code of ordinances, as if
fully set forth in the franchise; and deems to provide for forfeiture under the
circumstances set forth in the code of ordinances, as well as under the
provisions of this chapter. While the franchise is subject to HCO
Chapter 100, neither the Franchise, HCO
Chapter 100, nor the chapter is a contract.
(Ord. 02-2007, passed 1-16-2007)
§ 116.04 FRANCHISE AREA.

   (A)   Any franchise granted under this chapter shall not exceed ten years.
   (B)   The franchisee's rights under any franchise created by this chapter
terminate when the franchise terminates, whether by passage of time or
otherwise. The franchisee's obligations to the city shall survive the
termination of the franchise until the franchisee's cable system is removed
from the rights-of-way or acquired by the city or as required in HCO
Chapter 100. Further, franchisee shall remain obligated to indemnify and insure
the city against harm for any act or omission occurring prior to the date the
facilities are removed or acquired by the city or as required in HCO
Chapter 100.
(Ord. 02-2007, passed 1-16-2007)
§ 116.06 POLICE AND OTHER POWERS.
   (A)   Neither the granting of the franchise nor any provision of the
franchise or this chapter shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of
any governmental right of power, police power or regulatory power of the city
as may exist at the time the franchise was issued or may thereafter be
obtained. In accepting the franchise, the franchisee acknowledges its rights
hereunder are subject to the police and other rights and powers of the city.
   (B)   Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the city's rights and powers shall be
resolved in favor of the city.
(Ord. 02-2007, passed 1-16-2007)
§ 116.07 USE OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
   The city shall have the right to install and maintain free of charge upon
the poles or in any conduit within city limits owned by the franchisee any wire
and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable service
operations of the franchisee. This is provided that, if the franchisee is
authorized to erect poles or place conduit and the city uses the franchisee's
conduit or poles to install a cable system that competes with the franchisee in
the provision of cable service to residential subscribers, the franchisee may
charge the city a fair market rate to be negotiated and agreed to by the city
for the use of the poles or conduit to provide residential cable service. For
purposes of this section, a fair market rate shall be based on the rates
charged for similar use agreements in the city.
(Ord. 02-2007, passed 1-16-2007)
§ 116.08 NOTICES.
   All notices from franchisee to the city pursuant to the franchise shall be
to the City Clerk, City of Hopkinsville, P.O. Box 707, Hopkinsville KY 42241-

otherwise. Franchisee shall maintain with the city, throughout the term of the
franchise, an address for service of notices by mail.
(Ord. 02-2007, passed 1-16-2007)
§ 116.09 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.
   (A)   Indemnification. The franchisee to the maximum extent permitted by
law, hereby releases the city from and against any and all liability and
responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance
of the cable system. Franchisee further agrees not to sue or seek any money or
damages from the city in connection with the above-mentioned matters. The
franchisee further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the city from and
against any and all claims, demands or causes of action of whatsoever kind or
nature and from the resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys'
fees, liabilities, damages, orders, judgments or decrees sustained by the city
or any third party arising out of, by reason of or resulting from or of the
acts, errors or omissions of the franchisee, its agents, independent
contractors or employees related to or in any way arising out of the
construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable system. The
franchisee further covenants and represents the indemnification provision shall
survive the term of the franchise and continue in full force and effect as to
the responsibility to indemnify. For purposes hereof, the term CITY refers to
the city of hopkinsville, its trustees, elected and appointed officers, agents
and employees.
   (B)   Insurance.
      (1)   The franchisee shall maintain throughout the term of the franchise
and for such additional period prescribed by HCO §
100.05(B) adequate insurance to protect the city, and its residents, in a form
and in amounts as the city may prescribe by ordinance. The franchisee must
provide evidence it has insurance, in the form and in at least the amounts as
required HCO §
100.05(B) prior to the effective date of the franchise. The franchisee is
responsible for ensuring all contractors and subcontractors also have insurance
in the amount and in the form required by HCO §
100.05(B), and shall not allow any contractor or subcontractor to commence work
on its contract or subcontract until all similar such insurance required of the
same has been obtained and approved. If the franchisee, its contractors or
subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the city may order such
entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved.
      (2)   Certificates of insurance, containing the endorsements and proofs
required by HCO
Chapter 100, shall be filed as provided in HCO
Chapter 100. Copies of the insurance policies must be provided upon request.
      (3)   The franchisee's operations as granted pursuant to the franchise
are sufficiently limited that the requirements contained in HCO §
100.05(C), entitled Surety Instruments, are therefore waived.
(Ord. 02-2007, passed 1-16-2007)
§ 116.10 RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
   (A)   The franchisee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers, channel users or general citizens on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, age, sex, conditions of
physical disability, ethnic background or marital status. The franchisee shall
comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state and local laws,
regulations and all executive and administrative orders relating to
nondiscrimination which are hereby incorporated and made part of this chapter
by reference.
   (B)   The franchisee shall strictly adhere to the equal employment
opportunity requirements of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and to
state and local regulations, as amended from time to time.
   (C)   No signals shall be transmitted from a subscriber terminal for
purposes of monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices without the
express written permission of the subscriber and filing a copy of the written
permission with the City Clerk. The request for such permission shall be
contained in a separate document with a prominent statement the subscriber is
authorizing the permission in full knowledge of its provision. The written
permission shall be for a limited period of time not to exceed one year, which
shall be renewable at the option of the subscriber. No penalty shall be invoked
for a subscriber's failure to provide or renew such an authorization. The
authorization shall be revocable at any time by the subscriber without penalty
of any kind whatsoever provided such revocation request may be required to be
in writing by the franchisee. The authorization is required for each type or
classification of activity planned provided, however, the franchisee shall be
entitled to conduct system wide or individually addressed "sweeps" for the
purpose of verifying system integrity, controlling return-path transmission or
billing for services.
   (D)   The franchisee, or any of its agents or employees, shall not act
inconsistently with the provisions of any applicable federal, state or local
law governing the maintenance, disclosure and protection of the personally
identifiable information of a cable subscriber.
   (E)   The cable system shall be operated in a manner consistent with the
principle of fairness and equal accessibility of its facilities, equipment,
channels, studios and other services to all citizens, businesses, public
agencies or other entities having a legitimate use for the network; no one
shall be arbitrarily excluded from its use; and allocation of use of the
facilities shall be made according to the rules or decisions of the franchisee
and any regulatory agencies affecting the same.
   (F)   Except to the extent the city may not enforce such a requirement, the
franchisee is prohibited from discriminating in its rates or charges or from
granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber, group of
subscribers or group of potential subscribers. This is provided, however, that
franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in order to
attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a
non-discriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the
franchise area. This is further provided that franchisee may offer discounts
for the elderly, the disabled, the economically disadvantaged and such other
discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under federal law, if such
discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. The franchisee shall
comply at all times with all applicable federal laws related to rate regulation
and to any state or local laws to the extent such are not preempted.
   (G)   In the event a subscriber files a claim of discrimination with the
franchisee, the franchisee shall forward a copy of the complaint along with a
written explanation of how the complaint was resolved to the City
Administrative Officer of the City of Hopkinsville, P.O. Box 707, Hopkinsville,

from pursuing any other legal remedies.

   Without limiting any other indemnity provided for under this chapter, the
franchisee agrees it will indemnify the city, its trustees, elected and
appointed officers, agents and employees from and against any and all claims,
demands or causes of action of whatsoever kind or nature and the resulting
losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees, liabilities, damages,
orders, judgments or decrees should the issuance or validity of the
franchisee's franchise be challenged on the grounds that the same was issued in
violation of Kentucky law concerning bidding. The franchisee takes the
franchise without any representation by the city on its validity, and instead
warrants that it is solely relying on the representations of its own counsel.
The franchisee agrees that it will not seek to recover any payments made or
amounts expended to provide facilities or services under this chapter should
the franchise be declared invalid or void.

chapter. No requirement herein shall be read to limit or condition any of the
rights of the city under applicable law or HCO
Chapter 100. Instead, these are minimum requirements which the franchisee must
always satisfy, notwithstanding any other change in law. It is the duty of the
franchisee to construct, operate and maintain its cable system, and to move and
relocate its facilities, so that the city is not required to bear any costs or
delays as a result of the cable system's occupation of the rights-of-way, so
that the public is not discommoded, and so that the use of the rights-of-way by
the city and by others is not impeded. It is the duty of franchisee to repair
any damage caused to the rights-of-way or public property promptly to
specifications of the city or other responsible authority and to compensate the
property owner for any loss. It is likewise the duty of franchisee to repair
promptly any damage caused to private property and to compensate the private
property owner for any loss. Unless expressly provided otherwise, costs
associated with complying with this section and with applicable law shall be
borne by the franchisee, with no cost to the city.
   (A)   Standards for construction, operation and maintenance.
      (1)   Compliance with safety codes. The construction, operation and
maintenance of the system shall be performed in accordance with all applicable
sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and any amendments
thereto as well as all state and local law where applicable.
      (2)   Compliance with electrical codes. All installation of electronic
equipment shall be of a permanent nature, durable and installed in accordance
with the provisions of the code or codes adopted by the city, as amended.
      (3)   Antennas and towers. Antenna supporting structures (towers) shall
be designed for the proper loading zone as specified in Electronics Industry
Association's R.S. 222A. Specifications shall not violate any zoning or other
land use regulation adopted by the city.
      (4)   Compliance with aviation requirements. Antenna supporting
structures (tower) shall be painted, lighted, erected and maintained in
accordance with all applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation
Administration and all other applicable state or local codes and regulations.
      (5)   Construction standards and requirements. All of the franchisee's
plant and equipment (including, but not limited to, the antenna site, head-end
and distribution system, towers, house connections, structures, poles, wire,
cable, coaxial cable, fixtures and appurtenances) shall be installed, located,
erected, constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained
and operated in accordance with good engineering practices and performed by
experienced maintenance and construction personnel so as not to endanger or
interfere with improvements the municipality may deem proper to make, to
interfere in any manner with the rights of any property owner or to
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic on municipal
properties.
      (6)   Safety and nuisance requirements. The franchisee shall at all times
employ reasonable care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted
methods and devices preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause
damage, injury or nuisance to the public.
   (B)   Cable system design requirements. Throughout the franchise term, the
cable system shall:
      (1)   Provide cable service to an unserved area of the city, which is
less than 70 contiguous acres;
      (2)   Be capable of continuous 24-hour daily operation;
      (3)   Be capable of operating over an outdoor temperature range of -20°F
to +120°F and meeting all specifications as set forth herein over the
temperature range without catastrophic failure or irreversible performance
changes over variations in supply voltages from 105 to 130 volts AC;
      (4)   Be operated in such a manner as to avoid causing interference with
reception of off-the-air signals by non-subscribers;
      (5)   Be designed, installed and operated so as:
         (a)   To assure the delivery to all subscribers of standard color and
monochrome signals on all channels without noticeable picture degradation or
visible evidence of color distortion or other forms of interference directly
attributable to the performance of the cable system; or
         (b)   To meet FCC minimum standards in effect at the time of the
adoption of the chapter and such stricter or additional standards as may be
adopted.
      (6)   Provide and maintain a high degree of reliability, comparable to
the reliability achieved with the most reliable cable systems upgraded or
rebuilt after 1996. Reliability refers both to the ability to operate without
outages on any channel, and the ability to continuously meet applicable
technical and performance standards.
   (C)   Technical standards. The cable system shall, at all times, comply with
the technical standards established by the FCC or contained in HCO
Chapter 100.
   (D)   Performance monitoring
      (1)   Test procedures used in verification of the performance criteria
set forth herein, if not as set forth in paragraph 76.609, Subpart K of the FCC
Rules and Regulations, shall be in accordance with good engineering practices
and shall be fully described in an attachment to an annual certificate which
shall be filed with the city. The city may establish a deadline for submission
of the certificate if one is not established under federal law.
      (2)   To the extent that the report of measurements as required above may
be combined with any reports of measurements required by the FCC or other
regulatory agencies, the city shall accept such combined reports provided all
standards and measurements herein or hereafter established by the city are
satisfied.
      (3)   At any time after commencement of service to subscribers, the city
may require or conduct on its own additional tests, full or partial repeat
tests, different test procedures or tests involving a specific subscriber's
terminal. Additional tests may be made on the basis of complaints or at the
discretion of the city. The city will endeavor to so arrange its tests or
requests for such special tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to
franchisee or to the subscriber.
   (E)   Street occupancy.
      (1)   The franchisee shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other
facilities whenever possible and shall not construct or install any new,
different or additional poles, conduits or other facilities whether on public
property or on privately owned property until written approval of the city is
obtained. However, no location of any pole or wire holding structure or other
facility of the franchisee shall be a vested interest and the poles or
structures or facilities shall be removed or modified by the franchisee at its
own expense whenever the city or any person acting on the city's behalf
determines the public or the city's convenience would be enhanced thereby.
      (2)   The cable system of the franchisee shall be installed underground
in those areas of the city where existing telephone or electric services are
underground at the time of system construction. In areas where telephone and
electric utility facilities are installed aerially at the time of system
construction, the franchisee may install its facilities aerially with the
understanding that at such time as the existing aerial facilities are required
to be placed underground by the city, the franchisee shall likewise place its
facilities underground.
      (3)   A franchisee shall apply to the city at least ten calendar days
prior to the date franchisee commences any construction in any public rights-
of-way. The city shall cooperate with the franchisee in granting any permits
required providing such grant and subsequent construction by the franchisee
shall not unduly interfere with the use of such public rights-of-way and that
proposed construction shall be done in accordance with pertinent ordinance
provisions or any other requirements of the city. However, nothing herein
relieves franchisee of any of its permitting obligations or requires the city
to give preferential treatment to the franchisee in issuing permits; and
nothing herein limits the city's authority to deny permits. The city shall
issue an annual blanket permit for emergency-type system repairs that must be
performed in the rights-of-way, but franchisee must keep records showing each
case in which the permit was used and the use qualified as an emergency.
      (4)   All transmission lines, equipment and structures shall be so
installed and located as to cause minimum interference with the rights and
reasonable convenience of property owners and at all times shall be kept and
maintained in a safe, adequate, substantial condition and in good order and
repair. The franchisee shall at all times employ reasonable care and shall
install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices for
preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries or
nuisances to the public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other
devices shall be used at such times and places as are reasonably required for
the safety of all members of the public. Any poles or other fixtures placed in
any public way by the franchisee shall be placed in such a manner as not to
interfere with the usual travel on such public rights-of-way.
      (5)   The franchisee shall, at its own expense and in a manner approved
by the city, promptly restore to city standards and specifications any damage
or disturbance caused to the public rights-of-way or other public property as a
result of its operations or construction on its behalf.
      (6)   Whenever, in case of fire or other emergency, it becomes necessary
in the judgment of the Mayor, City Administrative Officer, Public Works
Director, Fire Chief or Police Chief to remove any of the franchisee's
facilities, the city may do so without prior notice.
      (7)   The franchisee or its designee shall have the authority to trim
trees on public property at its own expense as may be necessary to protect its
wires and facilities, subject to the supervision and direction of the city.
Trimming of trees on private property shall require written consent of the
property owner, a copy of which shall be filed with the city prior to
commencement of any trimming. All tree trimming must be performed in strict
accordance with applicable laws and accepted arborist's standards. Franchisee
is solely liable for any damage caused by tree trimming.
      (8)   The franchisee at its expense shall protect, support, temporarily
disconnect, relocate or remove any of its property when, in the opinion of the
city, the same is required by reason of traffic conditions; public safety;
street vacation; freeway or street construction; change or establishment of
street grade; or installation of sewers, drains, waterpipes, power lines,
signal lines, transportation facilities, tracks or any other type of structures
or improvements by governmental agencies whether acting in a governmental or a
proprietary capacity, or any other structure or public improvement including
but not limited to movement of buildings, urban renewal and redevelopment or
any program under which the city shall undertake to cause all such properties
to be located beneath the surface of the ground, street vacation or for any
other reason where the convenience of the city or the public would be served
thereby. If the franchisee fails to move its facilities by a time specified by
the responsible government authority, that authority may perform the work and
bill the franchisee therefore.
      (9)   The franchisee shall promptly move and relocate its cable system
for any private party authorized to occupy the public rights-of-way to
accommodate the construction, operation or maintenance of facilities by such
party. Costs shall be borne as provided by applicable law. Franchisee shall
also promptly move and relocate its cable system for any private person holding
a valid permit authorizing movement of oversized objects. However, franchisee
may refuse to move and relocate its facilities under this chapter if the third
party does not agree to bear the costs of movement and relocation.
      (10)   Upon failure of franchisee to commence, pursue or complete any
work required by law (including HCO
Chapter 100) or by the provisions of this chapter to be done in any public
right-of-way within the time prescribed and to the reasonable satisfaction of
the city and other affected party, the city or other affected party may, at its
option, cause the work to be done and the franchisee shall pay to the city and
the affected party the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the
entities to franchisee within 30 calendar days after receipt of such itemized
report.
      (11)   The franchisee shall make no paving cuts or curb cuts unless
absolutely necessary, and only after the proper permit has been issued by the
city.
      (12)   The franchisee shall install, in conduit, all cable passing under
any roadway.
      (13)   To the extent permitted by law, franchisee shall have no monetary
recourse whatsoever against city or its Mayor and Council, City Administrative
Officer, officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees for any loss,
costs, expenses or damages arising out of any provision or requirement of this
chapter or HCO
Chapter 100 because of the enforcement of this chapter or HCO
Chapter 100, or any action taken pursuant thereto including damages that may be
caused by movement or removal of the cable system during emergencies or in the
course of any other activity of the city in the public rights-of-way, except in
cases where the damage is the result of the city's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. In no event shall the city be liable to franchisee for any losses
resulting from the interruption of its business, or for any other consequential
damages, punitive damages or exemplary damages. The rights of city under this
provision are in addition to and shall not be read to limit any immunities the
city may enjoy or rights the franchisee may enjoy under federal or state law or
other provisions of this chapter.

§ 116.33 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE/ABANDONMENT/PURCHASE.
   (A)   It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service
insofar as their financial and other obligations to the franchisee are honored.
In the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the franchisee may be
required to continue to provide service for a reasonable period as directed by
the city in order to assure an orderly transition of service from the
franchisee to another entity. During any such transitional period, franchisee
shall operate its cable system in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter and applicable law.
   (B)   In the event franchisee fails to operate the system for seven
consecutive days without prior approval of the city or without just cause, or
willfully fails to provide service in accordance with its obligations hereunder
for any period, the franchisee will be deemed to have abandoned its cable
system. In the event, the city may, at its option, do any or all of the
following:
      (1)   Operate the system or designate an operator until such time as
franchisee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city or a
permanent operator is selected. If the city or a designee is required to
fulfill this obligation for the franchisee, the franchisee shall reimburse the
city or its designee for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues
from the cable system received by the city or its designee that are the result
of the franchisee's failure to perform;
      (2)   Declare the franchise forfeited and require the franchisee to
remove its cable system from the city by a time specified by the city, subject
to any rights the franchisee may have to abandon in place; and/or
      (3)   Take possession of all or a portion of the abandoned facilities, in
accordance with division (C) below.
   (C)   Purchase of cable system by city.
      (1)   If the franchise expires and renewal to the franchisee is denied or
franchisee no longer uses its cable system to provide cable service, the city
may acquire ownership of or effect a transfer of the cable system as provided
herein.
         (a)   At the expiration of the franchise term, if renewal is denied,
the city, at its election, shall have the right to purchase the cable system or
any part of it upon payment to the franchisee of a sum equal to the fair market
value of the cable system or the part taken (based on system value as a going
concern) but with no value allocated to the franchise itself.
         (b)   In the event of revocation or termination of the franchise,
except in the circumstances described in division (C)(1)(a), the city at its
election, shall have the right to purchase all or any part of the cable system
upon payment to the franchisee of a sum equal to an equitable price for the
cable system or the part taken, with no value allocated to the franchise
itself.
         (c)   Upon exercise of the purchase option by the city and its service
of an official notice of such action upon the franchisee, the franchisee shall
immediately transfer to the city possession and title to all of the purchased
facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable system, free of all
liens and encumbrances. The franchisee shall execute such warranty deeds or
other instruments of conveyance to the city as shall be reasonably necessary
for this purpose. Each contract entered into by franchisee with reference to
its cable system or operations under the franchise shall be subject to the
exercise of this option by the city.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the above, if the franchisee abandons the cable
system or any part of the cable system during the franchise term, if the
franchisee fails to operate its cable system in accordance with this chapter
during any transition period set forth under this section or if the franchisee
otherwise terminates its franchise, upon reasonable notice of at least 30 days
and an opportunity to be heard, the ownership of the cable system or the
abandoned portions thereof in public rights-of-way, or such portion as the city
may desire, shall revert to the city and the city may sell, assign or transfer
all or part of the assets of the cable system, or the City Council, at its
option, may use or dispose of the system as it sees fit. The franchisee shall
execute such quitclaim deeds and other documents as may be necessary to
transfer the cable system or affected part thereof free and clear of liens and
encumbrances to the city. Each contract entered into by franchisee with
reference to its cable system or operations under the franchise shall be
subject to the exercise of this right.
      (3)   Nothing herein in any respect affects the city's powers of eminent
domain or its right to exercise these powers with respect to the cable system.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   In KRS Chapter 100, the legislature of the State of Kentucky delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, Hopkinsville City Council ordains the following sections set forth
in this chapter.
(Ord. 16-2008, passed 8-5-2008)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 16-2008, passed 8-5-2008)
§ 151.03 PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels,

imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or
employee, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Federal Insurance Administration,
or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.

§ 151.10 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations, and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   A1-30 and AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood.) Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   A99 ZONE. That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is
connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls is new construction.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.

protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or VO Zone on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is

subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
   B and X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and AR/

including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for STRUCTURE.
   BUILDING/ZONING PERMIT. The building/zoning permit is issued by the Flood
Safety Officer when the regulations of this chapter are satisfied. Issuance of
a building/zoning permit does not relieve the builder/developer from the
obligations to comply with pertinent state and local ordinances.
   C and X (UNSHADED) ZONES. Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Flood Safety Officer (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community

subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the city based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.

special flood hazard or floodway, which changes the existing elevations and/or
contours for that particular section of the river. FILL MATERIAL is normally
considered rock, construction debris, earth, asphalt, or any material which, in
the opinion of the Flood Safety Officer, is a change to the area of special
flood hazard or floodway. It is the intent of this definition to cover any
foreign matter or material that is introduced into the area of special flood
hazard or floodway that did not exist on the site prior to the adoption of this
chapter.
   FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD. The flood that has a 0.2% chance of being equaled

Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency

Christian County Planning Commission.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by flood waters from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.

floor of a garage used solely for parking vehicles.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
151.51, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City of
Hopkinsville will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds
to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to
100 years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility which cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood
processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   HEC II. The Army Corps of Engineers' step back water computer program and/or
an approved computer modeling program.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).
      (1)   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish,
or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE 151.250. Plans for dams, levees, etc. to be
approved and permit issued by cabinet (Environmental and Public Protection
Cabinet):
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,

drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to require approval
by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
subsection (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.

constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM.  
      (1)   A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.

met:
         (a)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
         (b)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or
state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a
community participating in the NFIP.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to

   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter
suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.
(The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal;
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or
adjusted assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. The average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It
is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the flood

is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of
disaster response and recovery.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e. MUDFLOW). Describes a condition where there is a river, flow,
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (i.e. MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is
in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Flood Safety Officer only if
the MUDFLOW, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that
occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e. MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall

(Ord. 16-2008, passed 8-5-2008)
§ 151.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has
been provided as set forth in §§
151.07 and
151.51(B)(12), the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three feet above the base
flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood
waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of division (B) of this
section.
      (1)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth is
specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated three feet above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Flood Safety Officer will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states
as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: The
applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and
thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA
maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
(0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated three feet above the base flood
elevation.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, and attendant utility and sanitary facilities
elevated no lower than three feet above the level of the base flood elevation.
Structures located in all zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated
provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and use
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall certify that the standards of this division are satisfied.
Certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in §
151.20.
   (C)   Elevated buildings.
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings
that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls
below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living
space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs for
complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional
engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria (FEMA Technical
Bulletin 1-93):
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited
below the base flood elevation.
      (3)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
      (4)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms.
      (5)   The total floor area of all such enclosed areas shall not exceed
300 square feet.
      (6)   For enclosures greater than seven feet in interior height, where
elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest adjacent grade, a copy
of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the conversion of the area
below the lowest floor to a use or dimension contrary to the structures'
originally approved design, shall be presented as a condition of issue of the
final certificate of occupancy.
   (D)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
151.07 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris and
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments are prohibited unless certification (with
supporting data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood
levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge;
      (2)   If division (D)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) is prohibited,
except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A
replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of
division (E)(2)(c) below and the elevation standards of division (E)(2)(a)
below and §
151.30(J) above are met.
   (E)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved outside of
a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood,
must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and
anchoring.
      (2)   All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than three feet above the base flood elevation, and
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches above grade.
         (c)   The manufactured home must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
         (d)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, and
manufactured home must meet the standards of division (E)(2)(a) through (c)
above.
         (e)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-
30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes.
      (3)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed
and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations,
is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.

(Ord. 16-2008, passed 8-5-2008)
§ 151.51 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding.
This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a
structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood
elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The
long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met
if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided
in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be
met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to
screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are
more appropriate.
      (1)   The Hopkinsville-Christian County Planning Commission as
established by City Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The Hopkinsville-Christian County Planning Commission shall hear
and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Flood Safety Officer in the enforcement
or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Flood Safety Officer or
any taxpayer may appeal the decision to the County Circuit Court, as provided
by law.
      (4)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section, except for divisions (B)(8)(a) and (d)
below, and provided that the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation.
      (5)   In passing upon such applications, the Hopkinsville-Christian
County Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter,
and:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The necessity of the facility of a waterfront location, in the
case of a functionally-dependent facility.
         (f)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use.
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         (k)   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (6)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Hopkinsville-Christian County Planning Commission may attach
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (7)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (8)   The conditions for variances shall be as follows:
         (a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that a
variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character
and design of the building.
         (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a
variance would not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
151.10 under public safety and nuisance), cause fraud on or victimization of
the public (as defined in §
151.10), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         (c)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and
the elevation to which the structure is to be built, and stating that the cost
of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
         (d)   The Flood Safety Officer shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request.

DETERIORATED AND BLIGHTED BUILDINGS
§ 152.10 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS OF FACT; DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.
   (A)   The City Council finds that the need has arisen for the city to
address deteriorated or blighted vacant structures and properties which cause
deterioration to contiguous neighborhoods and which constitute a menace to the
public’s health, safety and welfare. The intent of this subchapter is to
establish standards and procedures to protect the public’s health, safety and
welfare by eliminating the blight and deterioration of vacant properties and
structures within neighborhoods while safeguarding the rights of owners of
blighted and deteriorated properties.
   (B)   The City Council finds and declares that there exists in the city
blighted or deteriorated vacant properties and/or structures and that there is
a need for the city to exercise the powers, functions and duties conferred by
KRS 99.705 to 99.730.
   (C)   The City Council further declares that the elimination of blighted or
deteriorated vacant properties and/or structures and subsequent preparation of
these properties and/or structures for sale or lease to be developed or
redeveloped constitutes a public purpose for which public money may be expended
and private property acquired as a governmental function to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the public.
(Ord. 11-88, passed 6-21-1988)
§ 152.11 HOUSING STANDARDS.
   The following are standards set forth by the City Council to determine if a
structure and/or property is substandard and meets the definition of

§ 155.01 PURPOSE.
   In order to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public by
minimizing as much as possible the dangers of flooding to life and property, it
is the intent of this chapter that runoff control devices be provided as land
areas are developed or redeveloped. It is not the intent that these areas be
used exclusively for detaining storm water, but be put to use for other
compatible urban uses.
(Ord. 14-79, passed 10-16-1979)
§ 155.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CONTROLLED RELEASE STRUCTURE. A facility constructed to regulate the volume
of storm water runoff that is conveyed during a specific length of time.
   DEVELOPED. Conditions after construction or other human-made change to
improved or unimproved, including, but not limited to, buildings or other
structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations.
   EXCESS STORM WATER. The portion of storm water runoff which exceeds the
capacity of storm sewers or natural drainage channels serving a specific
watershed.
   EXCESS STORM WATER PASSAGE. A channel formed in the ground surface to carry
storm water runoff which cannot be carried by normal drainage channels.
   FLOOD SAFETY OFFICER. The person appointed by the City Council to administer
the provisions of this chapter.
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. Asphalt, concrete or any other surface which does not
allow measurable infiltration.
   NATURAL DRAINAGE. Water which follows by gravity in channels formed by the
surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by the efforts of man.
   ON-SITE. Internal to the boundary of a development.
   POINT DISCHARGE. Release of storm water at a specific location.
   RETENTION. (Sometimes termed DETENTION.) Restraining the rate of storm water
runoff through some natural or human-made device.
   RUNOFF. Rainfall excess after natural losses from infiltration, evaporation,
transportation or incidental pondage.
   STORM WATER RUNOFF RELEASE RATE. The rate at which storm water runoff is
released from dominant to servient land.
   STORM WATER STORAGE AREA. An area designed to temporarily accumulate excess
storm water.
   SWALE. Surface-type conveyance for storm water, usually designed to carry
incidental, localized runoff.
(Ord. 14-79, passed 10-16-1979)
§ 155.03 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FOR DEVELOPERS.
   (A)   All developments undertaken as outlined in this chapter shall be done
in such a way as to ensure that storm water falling on a given site shall be
absorbed or retained onsite to the extent that after development the rate of
water leaving the site shall not be significantly different than if the site
had remained undeveloped.
   (B)   A developer shall not be permitted to disturb the land in such a
manner as to create significant water related damages to other landowners in
the vicinity by having point discharge creating erosion across land or placing
obstructions where floodpeak increases. If the point discharge is high enough
to produce erosion, other measures shall be taken to dissipate the flow.
   (C)   Where it can be demonstrated by the developer that a higher storm
water release rate will not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this
chapter and where such proposed release rate will not adversely affect
properties in the downstream portion of the watershed, the Flood Safety Officer
may permit the release to be used as deemed appropriate.
(Ord. 14-79, passed 10-16-1979) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.04 EXCESS STORM WATER PASSAGES.
   (A)   An excess storm water passage shall be provided for all storm water
areas. The passage shall have the capacity to convey through the proposed
development the excess storm water. The capacity for a passage shall be such
that it will be able to transport the peak rate of runoff from a 100-year
return frequency storm.
   (B)   There shall be no buildings or structures constructed within excess
storm passages, however, parking lots, playgrounds and park areas, which shall
not impair or endanger the water holding capability of a development shall be
considered compatible uses.
   (C)   Appropriate land planning shall be undertaken to preserve the existing
natural drainage of a proposed development as part of the excess storm water
passage.
   (D)   Open channels shall be protected from erosion by appropriate
vegetative cover, lining, or other treatment and earthen channel side slopes
shall be no steeper than two to one. Open channels with lining shall have a
maximum gradient on side slopes of 67% and channel side slopes steeper than 67%
shall be designed as structural retaining walls.
(Ord. 14-79, passed 10-16-1979) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.05 RUNOFF AND STORAGE CAPACITY.
   The volume of required storm water storage and runoff shall be calculated on
the basis of the runoff from a 100-year frequency storm with a three-hour
duration. The calculations can be made in accordance with the instantaneous
runoff factor method, the rational method, or other methods that may be deemed
appropriate by the Flood Safety Officer.
(Ord. 14-79, passed 10-16-1979)
§ 155.06 STORM WATER STORAGE AREAS.
   (A)   Storage areas shall be designed to the satisfaction of the Flood
Safety Officer and if possible to provide secondary purposes for recreation,
open spaces, parking lot or other types of use that will not be adversely
affected by intermittent flooding.
   (B)   All storm water storage areas must be designed to contain and safely
pass storm water runoff. The combined capacity of these storage areas shall be
sufficient to contain the storm from the development. The retention facility
must be designed for periodic maintenance and energy dissipater shall be
provided at points necessary. The combination of storage of the water from a
100-year storm and the design release rate shall not result in a storage
duration in excess of 72 hours.
   (C)   The pending of storm water runoff shall not exceed a depth of one foot
on a pedestrian mall area or one and one-half feet maximum in parking lots.
Where these areas are used for pending, the maximum depth should occur in the
most remote and least used areas.
   (D)   The drainage and grading design shall be prepared to insure that in a
100-year storm the depth of water runoff in any street, alley or pedestrian
mall will not exceed the level of the first floor of any building.
   (E)   For a 100-year storm, the pending of surface water on local, collector
and arterial streets must not exceed a depth of 18 inches at the gutter; water
exceeding this shall be designed to overflow into an excess storm water
passage. The maximum velocity of water in the deepest part of the gutter shall
be ten feet per second and paved gutters shall have a minimum grade of 0.5%.
   (F)   Overflow for each storm water storage area shall be provided in the
event a storm in excess of the design capacity occurs. The overflow shall be
constructed to function without specific attention and shall become part of the
excess storm water passage.
   (G)   Where rooftop storage of excess storm water is provided, the building
shall be provided with adequate structural design to insure that roof failure
does not occur. Overflow areas shall be provided so that the weight of stored
storm water will not exceed the structural capacity of the roof.
   (H)   For wet pond storage areas when calculating the storage capacity, only
the volume available to store excess storm water shall be considered. Permanent
water storage does not constitute control of excess storm runoff.
(Ord. 14-79, passed 10-16-1979) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.07 SINKHOLES, SUBTERRANEAN WATER CHANNELS.
   (A)   The use of sinkholes or subterranean water channels for direct
drainage of excess storm water shall not be permitted although they may be used
to drain a storm water storage area. The introduction of any foreign matter or
the filling, clogging or interfering with the natural drainage capabilities of
the sinkholes shall not be permitted.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation proposing alterations, improvements or
other disturbance of any sinkholes or known subterranean water channel must
submit plans to the Flood Safety Officer showing that the alterations,
improvements or disturbance would not interfere with the drainage capability.
Also included in the plan’s erosion control methods must be shown for any
activities which might create erosion or sedimentation.
   (C)   Sinkholes shall not be altered or covered in any way which would

course of development of an participating subdivision. The contract language
will read as follows:
   “The owner/developer agrees to hold harmless the City of Hopkinsville,
Community and Development Services or any other department or agency if upon
the completion of a qualified home or subdivision, funding for the incentive
program is unavailable. The owner/developer understands that funding is limited
and will be distributed to participating owner/developer(s) on a "first come,
first serve" basis and there is no obligation on the part of the city,
Community and Development Services or any other department or agency to fund
the incentive provided for in Ordinance ____________. The owner/developer

Certificate of Occupancy (CO) issued for the structure will be required before
rebate eligibility.

be determined by the number of lots contained in the final plat, (i.e. if there
are 100 lots shown on the preliminary plat, but the first phase of the final
plat shows 20 lots, the potential rebate after each house is built will be

developer will only be eligible for the number of lots shown on the preliminary
plat, (i.e. 100 lots are shown on the preliminary plat, the owner/developer
amends the final plat and increases the number of lots to 120, the owner/

   (E)   When an accessory building is to be located on a corner lot, the side
lot line of which is substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the
lot to its rear, the building shall not project beyond the front yard line
required on the lot in rear of the corner lot.
   (F)   In any residential zone no garage shall be erected closer to the side
lot line than the permitted distance for the dwelling, unless the garage shall
be completely to the rear of the dwelling, in which event the garage may be
erected five feet from the side and rear lot line. No garage or portion thereof
shall extend beyond the front building line of the dwelling. Attached garages
of fireproof construction may be erected to extend beyond the front line of the
house in those areas which are being developed according to a common plan that
includes the construction of attached garages extending beyond the front line
of the house, except that such garages shall not encroach in or upon the
minimum front yard area as required by these regulations, and provided the

§ 158.042 AUTOMOBILE WRECKING AND JUNKYARDS (SALVAGE YARDS).
   Because of the nature and character of their operations, automobile wrecking
and salvage yards, junkyards and similar uses of land can have a decidedly
detrimental effect upon surrounding properties. Salvage and wrecking yards tend
to create problems of noise, dust, traffic and health hazards; and may
adversely affect property values by their general appearance. The following
standards shall be used as a guide in evaluating whether proposed land uses,
such as those outlined herein, will have properly minimized their objectionable
characteristics.
   (A)   Licensing. All salvage yards must be licensed. An application to
establish a salvage yard in the city shall be filed with the Planning
Commission and approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. For the purpose of
this chapter, junkyards, automobile wrecking yards and similar operations shall
be known as “salvage yards”.
   (B)   Location. No salvage yard shall be permitted closer than 500 feet from
any established residential district, unless in existence prior to the adoption
of this chapter. The storage of three or more unlicensed abandoned vehicles and
salvaged vehicles must be in an approved and licensed salvage yard. All
abandoned and junked motor vehicles and other similar large salvage articles
that can be seen from any public right-of-way shall be moved to a licensed
salvage yard within one year of the effective date of this chapter.
   (C)   Screening. All outdoor storage in salvage yards shall be conducted
entirely within an enclosed fence or wall, except the driveway area. The fence
or wall shall be seven feet in height and appropriately screened to prohibit
the visibility of the salvage material. Storage outside or above such fence or
wall is expressly prohibited. Any fence or wall erected for screening purposes
shall comply with §§
158.210 through
158.228.
   (D)   Ingress and egress. The maximum number of vehicular access driveways
for salvage yards having frontage on a state or federal highway shall be as
regulated by the State of Kentucky, Department of Transportation. The maximum
number of vehicular access driveways for salvage yards having frontage on a
city street shall be regulated by the City Council with recommendations from
the Planning Commission.
   (E)   Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall be as regulated in §§
158.160 through
158.163.
(Ord. 11-85, passed 12-3-1985) Penalty, see §
158.999
§ 158.043 CLASSIFICATION OF NEW AND UNLISTED USES.
   It is recognized that new types of land uses will develop and that different
forms of land uses will seek to locate in the city. In order to provide for the
changes, a determination of the appropriate zoning classification of any new or
unlisted form of land use shall be made as follows.
   (A)   All questions concerning the classification of new or unlisted uses
shall be referred to the Zoning Inspector for an interpretation of this
chapter. The referral of the use interpretation question shall be accompanied
by a statement of facts listing the nature of the use and whether it involves
dwelling activity, sales, processing, storage and amount and nature thereof,
anticipated employment, types of product, transportation requirements, nature
and time of occupancy or operation of the premises, the amount of noise, odor,
fumes, dust, toxic material and vibrations likely to be generated, and the
requirements for public utilities such as sanitary sewers and water.
   (B)   The Zoning Inspector shall consider the nature and described
performance of the proposed use and assign a use classification descriptive of
the proposed use from
Appendix A (Schedule of Uses) or assign a use as is otherwise specifically
provided for in this chapter.
   (C)   Appeals from determinations of the Zoning Inspector are made to the
Board of Zoning Adjustment pursuant to §
158.305.
   (D)   If the Zoning Inspector or the Board of Zoning Adjustment, operating
under divisions (B) or (C) of this section, determines the described use does
not appear within the code, the Zoning Inspector or the Board of Zoning
Adjustment will transmit a copy of the determination to the Planning Commission
and City Council. The Planning Commission or City Council may initiate a text
amendment to schedule the proposed use.
   (E)   Barring amendment as provided in division (D) above, proposed uses
which do not appear within the code shall not be deemed a permitted use within
the City of Hopkinsville.

§ 158.044 LOCATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PACKAGE LIQUOR STORES, TAVERNS, BARS, AND
SALOONS.
   (A)   No person, firm, association or corporation shall establish a package
liquor store, tavern, bar, and/or saloon within 500 feet of any structure being
used as a quasi-public use as defined in §
158.002 (Definitions), without first obtaining a conditional use permit from
the Hopkinsville Board of Zoning Adjustment.
      (1)   The 500 feet distance shall be measured from building to building -
at their closest points to any established structure being used as a quasi-
public use, except as may be provided herein; provided that nothing herein
contained shall affect any such business, package liquor store, tavern, bar,
and/or saloon, which was actually being legally carried on within such distance
of any established quasi-public use on or before January 1, 2014.
      (2)   If any dispute arises between the applicant and the City Alcoholic
Beverage Control Administrator regarding the distance, the applicant shall
provide a survey prepared by a professional licensed surveyor verifying the
distance from building to building.
   (B)   Upon application to the City Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator,
a person, firm, association or corporation applying to operate a package liquor
store, tavern, bar, and/or saloon shall certify that there are no structures
being used as a quasi-public use within 500 feet of the proposed location(s).
   (C)   (1)   If structures being used as a quasi-public use are located
within 500 feet of the proposed location(s), the applicant shall obtain a
conditional use permit from the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The process and
requirements shall comply with §
158.110 through §
158.118 (Conditional Uses).
      (2)   In addition to adjoining property owners, any quasi-public use(s)
within the 500 foot distance requirement shall be notified of the public
hearing by registered mail.
   (D)   Pursuant to §
158.118 (Expiration of a Conditional Use), a conditional use permit shall be
deemed to authorize only one particular conditional use and the permit shall
automatically expire if, for any reason, the conditional use shall cease (to
discontinue) for more than one year.
   (E)   Any person, firm, association or corporation applying to establish a
package liquor store, tavern, bar, and/or saloon within the Special Use
District (SUD) 41A as outlined in §
158.400 through §
158.411 shall obtain a conditional use permit from the Board of Zoning
Adjustment, regardless of use classification. The conditional use permit may be
processed concurrently with a development plan review by Community and
Development Services, and may be reviewed by Community and Development Services
assuming the duties of the Board of Zoning Adjustment pursuant to §
158.302 (Planning Commission; Proceedings; Duties).

§ 158.045 REQUIREMENTS FOR SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS (SES).
   (A)   (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to facilitate the
siting, development, construction, installation, and decommissioning of solar
energy systems (SESs) in the city in a predictable manner that promotes and
protects the safety, health, and welfare of the community. This section
encourages the appropriate siting of SESs to bolster local economic development
and job creation, diversify the state's energy portfolio, strengthen energy and
grid security, and reduce other environmental impacts. This section also
establishes standards and requirements to assure that the use and enjoyment of
lands located adjacent to and in the proximity of SESs are fully protected.
      (2)   The requirements of this section are intended to be supplemental to
any safety, health, or environmental requirements of federal, state, or local
laws and regulations.
   (B)   Applicability. This section applies to the siting, construction,
installation, and decommissioning of any new SESs within the city on or after
the effective date of this section. An SES in operation, or which has begun
physical construction prior to this section's effective date, shall be
considered to have legal nonconforming status in accordance with KRS 100.253
and §
158.090 of this chapter.
      (1)   The following are not subject to this section:
         (a)   Modification to an existing SES that alone or in combination
increases the total SES footprint by no more than 5% of the original footprint;
         (b)   Routine maintenance and repair, including replacement of solar
panels, not increasing the SES footprint;
         (c)   Any SES exempted by the provisions of KRS 100.324. Any exempt
SES shall provide the Planning Commission information concerning service
facilities which have been located on and relocated on private property in
accordance with KRS 100.324(3).
      (2)   Notwithstanding the exemptions provided by this section, an SES
shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations,
and permitting and other requirements, and applicable building, fire,
electrical and plumbing codes.
   (C)   Permit required. A zoning/building permit is required prior to the
physical construction of a solar energy system in the city. Prior to the
issuance of a zoning/building permit, ground mounted SESs are subject to the
site plan review requirements of §§
158.255 through
158.261 and, where applicable, the conditional use permit requirements of §§
158.110 through
158.118 of this chapter.
   (D)   General requirements applicable to integrated and rooftop solar energy
systems. Integrated SESs and rooftop SESs are permitted in all districts and on
all lands within the city subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   Solar access. Consistent with KRS 381.200(2), a property owner may
obtain a solar easement from another property owner for the purpose of ensuring
adequate exposure to sunlight for an integrated or rooftop SES. Where obtained,
such easements shall be platted and recorded.
      (2)   Tree removal. The removal of trees or natural vegetation for an
integrated or rooftop SES and solar easements shall not conflict with the
provisions of §§
158.210 through
158.228 of this chapter.
      (3)   Height restrictions. A rooftop SES shall conform to the height
restrictions of the applicable zoning district. A rooftop SES shall be
positioned on the roof so as not to extend above or beyond the edge of any
ridge, hip, valley, or eave, provided that where it is mounted on a sloped
roof, the SES shall not vertically exceed the highest point of the roof to
which it is attached by more than five feet.
      (4)   Lighting. Integrated and rooftop SESs shall not be illuminated and
shall be designed and installed to prevent off-site glare.
      (5)   Historic preservation. Where an integrated or rooftop SES is
proposed to be installed on a property located within the Mount Pleasant
Historic District, the South Virginia Street Alumni-Latham-Mooreland Historic
District, or any historic district hereafter created by City Council, the
proposed installation shall be coordinated with any review required under the
historic preservation guidelines applicable to such district.
   (E)   General requirements applicable to ground mounted SESs. Ground mounted
SESs are permitted in accordance with the provisions of this section and the
provisions of Appendix A of this chapter.
      (1)   Solar access. Consistent with KRS 381.200(2), a property owner may
obtain a solar easement from another property owner for the purpose of ensuring
adequate exposure to sunlight for a ground mounted SES. Where obtained, such
easement shall be platted and recorded.
      (2)   Tree removal. The removal of trees or natural vegetation for a
ground mounted SES and solar easements shall not conflict with the provisions
of §§
158.210 through
158.228 of this chapter nor the provisions of this section.
      (3)   Lighting. Lighting of a ground mounted SES shall be limited to the
minimum necessary for safe operation, and shall be directed downward,
incorporate full cut-off features, and incorporate motion sensors where
feasible. Lighting shall be designed to avoid light trespass. Nothing in this
section is intended to preclude installation of lighting required by the
Federal Aviation Administration.
      (4)   Height requirements for ground mounted SES. A ground mounted SES
shall not exceed 20 feet in height as measured from the highest natural grade
below each solar panel. The height restriction excludes utility poles, storage
batteries, substation structures, and antennas constructed for the project.
      (5)   Siting restrictions for ground mounted SES.
         (a)   Small scale ground mounted energy systems as measured from the
outer edge of the nearest panel are not permitted in a required front yard and
shall be setback a minimum of 30 feet from any lot line.
         (b)   An intermediate or large scale ground mounted SES, measured from
the closer of the outer edge of the nearest panel or perimeter fencing, shall
be located:
            1.   At least 100 feet from the nearest lot line of any property
zoned EST-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, B-1 or P-1;
            2.   At least 100 feet from the nearest lot line of any property
containing a residential use (excluding residential uses located on the same
lot as the SES);
            3.   At least 50 feet from the right-of-way boundary of any public
road; and
            4.   Where not addressed by divisions (E)(5)(b)1. through 3. above,
at least 30 feet from any lot line.
         (c)   Setbacks are not required where the property line is shared by
two or more participating landowners.
         (d)   Setback requirements may be expanded by the Board of Zoning
Adjustment as a condition of approval of a conditional use permit, where deemed
necessary to assure effective screening or separation between uses.
         (e)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (D)(5)(b) above, the
SES footprint of a large scale ground mounted SES facility which constitutes a
siting board regulated SES as defined herein or any large scale SES having a
footprint occupying an aggregate of 40 or more contiguous acres shall be
located:
            1.   At least 1,000 feet from any lot line;
            2.   At least 2,000 feet from the nearest lot line of any property
zoned EST-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, B-1 or P-1; and
            3.   At least 2,000 feet from the nearest lot line of any property
containing a residential use or quasi-public use.
         (f)   A variance from the setbacks required by divisions (D)(5)(b) or
(e) of this section may be granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment pursuant
to §
158.307 or, in the case of zoning map amendment, by the Planning Commission
pursuant to §
158.243 of the City Code of Ordinances, as amended.
      (6)   Screening. Excluding small scale ground mounted energy systems,
perimeter screening shall be provided. Screening shall:
         (a)   Consist of an eight-foot tall fence and a double row of
staggered evergreen trees (minimum five feet in height at planting and maturing
to a minimum of 15 feet in height);
         (b)   Evergreen trees shall be planted exterior to the fence and shall
be setback no less than 15 feet from any property line;
         (c)   Screening shall achieve an opacity of 90% to a height of no less
than eight feet within three years of planting;
         (d)   Screening shall be installed within 180 days of the start of
physical construction and shall be maintained until the decommissioning of the
SES is completed; and
         (e)   All unhealthy, dead, or noncompliant plantings shall be repaired
or replaced within 90 days of such occurrence.
      (7)   Exception. Unless required as part of a conditional use permit, the
planting provisions of this part do not apply along a property or SES footprint
boundary in the following instances:
         (a)   Existing tree lines or plantings are retained on the site which
achieve the opacity and minimum planting height as specified above;
         (b)   The affected property boundary (excluding a right-of-way
boundary) abuts property that is zoned I-2 (Heavy Industrial District) and the
SES footprint is located not less than 100 feet from the property line; or
         (c)   The SES development involves the use of berms or natural grade
of a height comparable to vegetative screening and effectively obscures
visibility from an adjoining property or public right-of-way.
      (8)   Signage. A ground mounted SES may include such signage as is
required by law to provide safety information, and other signage as may be
allowed under this chapter.
      (9)   Decommissioning. Other than as specifically approved by the Board
of Zoning Adjustment, decommissioning shall begin no later than 12 months after
a ground mounted SES has ceased to generate electricity or thermal energy. All
structures and facilities associated with the SES shall be removed within six
months of the beginning of decommissioning. All materials shall be recycled or
otherwise reused to the extent reasonably practicable and the disturbed areas
shall be reclaimed, revegetated and restored.
      (10)   Application required; supplemental information and exhibits. In
addition to the application requirements of §
158.110, et seq. (Conditional use permit), §
158.255, et seq. (Plan review), and §
158.275, et seq. (Zoning/building permit), an application to establish or
enlarge an intermediate or large scale ground mounted SES shall include:
         (a)   Documentation, such as a deed, lease, or other agreement with
the landowner, demonstrating the applicant's right to use and control the
property;
         (b)   A description of the project, including the maximum number of
modules, mounting type (fixed-tilt or tracking), system height, system
capacity, total land area covered by the system, and information on all
associated structures and facilities, and substations. The site plan shall also
identify existing and proposed temporary or permanent roads, drives, and
parking, fencing or other methods to ensure public safety, and a visual buffer

use established in the planned unit development within two years from the date
of approval of the development plan, the special use permit will lapse and have
no further effect. Construction is hereby defined to include the placing of
construction materials in a permanent position and fastening them in a
permanent manner. In its discretion and for good cause, the Planning Commission
may extend for one or more additional years the period for the initiation of
construction of the establishment of a use.
      (6)   Amendment or withdrawal of special use permit. Pursuant to the same
procedure and subject to the same limitations and requirements by which the

amended or withdrawn, either partially or completely, if all the conditions and
limitations of the special use permit and all land and structures withdrawn
from the special use permit comply with all regulations established by this
chapter and unrelated to the special use permit.
      (7)   Waivers. An applicant citing the design or other exceptional
characteristics of the proposed development may request the Planning Commission

Council disagrees with the Planning Commission’s action, it shall adopt a
municipal order directing the Planning Commission to alter its action in
accordance with its directions and conditions.
         (c)   If the Planning Commission fails to comply with the Council’s
order at its next regularly scheduled meeting, the alterations specified in the

conditions and safeguards in accord with other provisions of this chapter.

nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to

combination is discontinued or abandoned for more than one year (except when
government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or structure
and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (F)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.

appearing daily, and that many of these and some other more conventional uses
possess characteristics of a unique and special nature relative to location,
design, size, method of operation, circulation and public facilities that each
specific use must be considered individually. These specific uses as they are
conditionally permitted under the provisions of §§
158.055 through
158.071 or
Appendix A, Official Schedule of Uses, shall follow the procedures and
requirements set forth.

Appendix A for the zoning district involved;

responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services;
   (F)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
   (G)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare or odors;
   (H)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so

   (B)   In applying the standards set forth above, the following shall apply:
      (1)   Accessory uses are calculated using the formula applicable to the
principle use of the property and are considered inclusive of the total
required for the principle use of property. In the case of mixed or joint uses,
the parking spaces required shall equal the sum of the requirements of various
uses computed separately. In cases of mixed or joint uses or in cases as
provided in §
158.160(B)(6) below, parking facilities may be shared if multiple uses
cooperatively establish and operate parking facilities if these uses generate
parking demands at different times. (For example, if one use operates during
the evenings and weekends only and the other use operates during the weekdays
only.) The applicant shall have the burden of proof for a reduction in the
total number of required parking spaces, and shall provide documentation to
include covenants, deed restrictions or other agreements to ensure conformance
with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Where a fractional space results, any fraction less than one-half
may be dropped and any fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as one
parking space.
      (3)   These standards shall apply fully to all uses and buildings
established after the effective date of this chapter.
      (4)   Except for parcels of land devoted to one- and two-family uses, all
areas devoted to off-street parking shall be so designed and be of such size
that no vehicle is required to back into a public street to obtain egress.
      (5)   Where parking is to be provided in the front yard of a multiple-
family dwelling, there shall be established a setback line of ten feet. The
area between the setback line and front lot line shall be prepared and planted
with grass, shrubs or trees.
      (6)   All parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same lot
with the building or use served. However, when an increase in the number of
spaces is required by a change of use or enlargement of the building or where
the spaces are provided collectively or used jointly by two or more buildings
or establishments, the required spaces may be located and maintained not to
exceed 400 feet from any other nonresidential building served.
      (7)   No signs of any kind shall be erected except information signs used
to guide traffic and to state the conditions and terms of the use of the lot.
Only non-intermittent white lighting of signs shall be permitted.

   (M)   The necessity of screening and the type of screening required varies
greatly with each particular situation. Therefore, it is the intent of this
section to provide a discretionary measure in deciding the appropriate height,
width and type of screening necessary, with the following provisions:
      (1)   Required screening; height limits. Screening shall be required and
adequately maintained in the following situations:
         (a)   Where a business zone abuts a residential zone, a screen will be
required along the boundary of the business property adjacent to the
residential property;
         (b)   Where an industrial zone abuts a residential zone, a screen will
be required along the boundary of the industrial property adjacent to the
residential property; and
         (c)   Where a business or industrial zone abuts a residential zone, a
screen will be required along the boundary of the adjacent residential zone.
            1.   Where on any lot, or portion thereof, automobiles, appliances
and their component parts are under repair or reduction, a screen shall be
required.
            2.   Off-street parking lots shall be screened when located
adjacent to or in a residential zone.
            3.   Mobile home parks shall provide a screen along their property
lines.
            4.   Fences in a residential zone, which may be placed along a
boundary for the purpose of providing privacy or security to the resident,
shall follow the following height limitations:
               a.   Front yard: three feet;
               b.   Fences shall be of a decorative design (chain link, barbed
wire, stock wire, chicken wire and similar type fences are not permitted);
               c.   Side yard: eight feet; and
               d.   Rear yard: eight feet.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, FENCE shall be interpreted to
include any type of fence, wall, trellis or structure placed for the purpose of
this section.
      (3)   All fences shall be constructed of durable materials and shall be
installed to withstand the elements. Fences shall be maintained in good repair
at all times.
      (4)   Uses specified above as requiring screening shall provide a visual
obstruction from adjacent properties in conformance with the following
standards: The screen may be composed of view-obscuring vegetation, wall, fence
or berm. The items may be used individually or in combination. Fences
constructed of chain link, barbed wire, stock wire, chicken wire or other
similar type fences are not permitted when used for screening. The result shall
be opaque 80% screen, which obscures views from the ground to a height of the
object being screened; however, the screen is not required to exceed eight
feet. Plant materials shall be at least two feet tall at the time of
installation and reach the desired height within three to five years. When a
combination of features is proposed, one-fourth of the surface area of walls,
fences or berms that face off-site must be covered with plant material within
three to five years. Berms, when utilized, should not have a slope steeper than
three to one (3:1). Additionally, screen areas shall be sufficient to allow for
the mature growth of plant materials when used.

regulations.
      (2)   Deciduous trees (trees which normally shed their leaves in the
fall). Deciduous trees should be species having an average mature crown spread
of greater than 15 feet and having trunks which can be maintained with over
five feet of clear wood in areas which have visibility requirements.
      (3)   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of five feet
high with a minimum caliber of one and one-half inches and a minimum spread of
three feet immediately after planting.
      (4)   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least two feet to
three feet in average height or spread when planted and shall conform to
opacity and other requirements within four years after planting.
      (5)   Vines. Vines shall be at least 12 to 15 inches high at planting and
are generally used in conjunction with walls or fences.

§ 158.222 MAINTENANCE AND INSTALLATION.
   (A)   All landscaping materials shall be installed in a sound, workmanlike
manner and according to accepted good construction and planting procedures. Any
landscape material, which fails to meet the requirements of this chapter at the
time of installation, shall be removed and replaced with acceptable materials.
Inspections will be conducted by the Zoning Inspector after installation of
landscaping to assure compliance with the submitted and approved site plan. The
person in charge of or in control of the property whether as owner, lessee,
tenant, occupant or otherwise shall be responsible for the continued proper
maintenance of all landscaping materials and shall keep them in a proper, neat
and orderly appearance free from refuse, debris, noxious weeds and unwanted
grass at all times. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced
within one year four months or by the next planting period, whichever comes
first; while other defective landscape material shall be replaced or repaired
within three two months. Plant material shall not be severely pruned such that
the natural growth pattern or characteristic form is significantly altered.
Surfaces denuded of vegetation shall be seeded or sodded to prevent soil
erosion. The removal or destruction of landscape material previously approved
by the city shall constitute a violation of the zoning ordinance. Replacement
of landscape material shall be of like type as that which was removed or
destroyed. Surety will be submitted as a part of the public improvements.
   (B)   Violation of these installation and maintenance provisions shall be
grounds for the Zoning Inspector to refuse a building certificate of occupancy
permit, require replacement of landscape material and will subject those in
violation to established fines and penalties of this chapter.

§ 158.223 PLAN SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL.
   Whenever any property is affected by these landscaping requirements, the
property owner or developer shall prepare a landscape plan for submittal to,
and approval by, the Planning Commission. The Zoning Inspector shall follow the
requirements of this subchapter in approving or disapproving any landscape plan
required by this subchapter. Landscape plans also may be submitted as part of
any plan review required by the Planning Commission. The property owner or
developer shall submit the Landscape Plan to the Zoning Inspector as part of
the site plan review process.

§ 158.225 VARIANCE.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall have the authority to grant a waiver of
any of the requirements in this chapter upon written request, which outlines
the rationale for the waiver. The Planning Commission shall review each written
request and grant a waiver only; under unusual or extreme circumstances which
cause an unreasonable hardship such as the size of the lot; or, when an
innovative or alternative approach can be made which still meets the intent and
purpose of this chapter.

§ 158.226 HARDSHIP EXCLUSION.
   No property owner obtaining a permit for a project involving a new building
or building addition shall be required to expend more than 1-1/2% of the total
construction cost for materials and installation costs associated with
landscaping and parking lot screening required by this chapter. No property
owner obtaining a permit for a project involving only a new or expanded parking
lot, with no building construction, shall be required to expend more than 3% of
the total construction costs for materials and installation costs associated
with parking lot landscaping and screening required by this chapter. In order
to qualify for this exclusion, the property owner must submit a bona fide bid
from a licensed contractor or nurseryman for materials and installation costs
for an approved landscape plan. The bid for landscaping must distinguish those
items which are required by the ordinance from any other items which are not
required. If the total cost of required landscaping items exceeds the
applicable percentage as specified above, then the property owner may select
items at his or her discretion to delete from the approved plan, and submit the
list of items to be deleted as an addendum to the approved plan.

peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
         (b)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter;
         (c)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant; and
         (d)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that negatively impacts other land structures
or buildings in the immediate vicinity.
   (C)   A variance shall not be granted unless the Board makes specific
findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it,
which support conclusions that the standards and conditions imposed by division
(B)(5) above have been met by the applicant.

SPECIAL USE DISTRICT
§ 158.400 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   This district is intended to provide land use compatibility along US 41A,
more particularly described in the Special Use District (SUD) 41A District Map,
being the same real property as annexed into the City of Hopkinsville
boundaries by virtue of the adoption and enactment of Ord. 2-95, Ord. 18-96 and
all subsequent annexations that are contiguous with the original the
properties, said ordinances being incorporated herein by reference as if fully
set forth. The specific intent of this district is to ensure that land use
compatibility is planned and maintained through an emphasis on proper design to
preserve areas of productive farming, safeguard existing land uses and to
prevent injurious effects on the adjacent properties. Furthermore, the intent
of this district is to encourage design flexibility in order to capitalize on a
site’s desirable features in ways that might be prohibited under conventional
zoning while still accomplishing the primary purpose of this district. At the
same time this district is intended to provide appropriate space, adequate
parking, sufficient depth from U.S. 41A, controlled access points and orderly
and planned development. All requirements of this subchapter shall apply to all
subdivisions of land within this district after the adoption of this
subchapter.

surrounding uses due to use, size, intensity, density or noise. INCOMPATIBLE
USES are proposed uses that cannot meet the buffer distance requirement and
cannot receive approval of a dimensional variance. INCOMPATIBLE USES are
prohibited at the proposed site.
      (5)   CONDITIONAL USE. A use that is listed as a conditional use in an R-
1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, B-1, P-1 or B-4 district in accordance with

§ 158.403 LAND USE CLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   Creation. The SUD 41A is hereby created and designed to accommodate
the variety of mixed land uses and provide for the compatibility among those
uses. All land uses within this district shall be determined as either an
allowable use, an existing use, a special use, transitional use or a prohibited
use and a land use classification assigned per this section. Allowable uses,
existing uses, transitional uses and special uses shall be assessed to
determine the land use classification. The land use classification identifies
and determines the use, the size, the intensity and or density of the property
and how the use relates to surrounding uses.
      (1)   To determine the land use classification within the SUD 41A, for a
proposed use, the listed steps shall be followed:
         (a)   Identify the type of proposed use and determine if the proposed
use is allowable, pursuant to the definition of an allowable use;
         (b)   Identify the size and intensity/density of the use and determine
the land use classification of the allowable use; and
         (c)   Categorize the proposed use by the land use classification,
determine the adjoining land use classifications and if the proposed use is
compatible.
      (2)   Parcels of property that have been assigned a land use
classification shall only be developed per the standard in which that land use
classification permits. Land use classification boundaries shall observe parcel
(lot) boundaries. Land use classifications assigned at the time of adoption of
this subchapter shall remain assigned to that property until a rezoning request
is made and granted. Subdivision and/or conveyance to another property owner
shall not change the land use classification that was originally assigned to

setback distance.
   (D)   Subdivisions. All subdivisions of land shall comply with the rules and
regulations of land subdivisions in the Hopkinsville Subdivision Regulations.
All major and minor subdivisions of land, as defined in the Hopkinsville
Subdivision Regulations, that have frontage on, abut and/or adjoin U.S. 41A,
that have or propose to have direct access onto U.S. 41A or industrial lots,
are required to have five or more acres per lot in area. Lot size can be
reduced if access onto U.S. 41A is not direct access and has indirect access
either by frontage roads or intersecting streets.
(Ord. 33-99, passed 11-2-1999)
§ 158.406 SPECIAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Signs. All signs and outdoor advertising displays are subject to the
provisions established in §§
158.175 through
158.184 Hopkinsville Code of Ordinances, Signs and Outdoor Advertising
Displays. The following are additional requirements to provisions set forth in
§§
158.175 through
158.184 Hopkinsville Code of Ordinances; master signage plans submitted with
development plans are subject to review and approval by the Planning
Commission.
      (1)   The following items are prohibited from this district:
         (a)   Banners;
         (b)   Beacons/spotlights;
         (c)   Promotional displays/devices;
         (d)   Inflated or tethered balloons; and
         (e)   Billboards.
      (2)   The setback for all signs and outdoor advertising displays shall be
50 feet on the property line that has frontage on U.S. 41A. For lots that face
a street that intersects with U.S. 41A the setback for signs is ten feet and
must observe the 50-foot setback for the side property line that abuts U.S.
41A. No sign or outdoor advertising display shall be placed in a required
buffer distance or landscape easement.
   (B)   Traffic circulation.
      (1)    Points of vehicular ingress and egress to the site shall be
limited to the adjacent major or minor arterial only, and site plans shall be
reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and the Kentucky Department of
Transportation for location and design of curb cuts, driveways and for layouts
of parking lots.
      (2)   Crossovers on U.S. 41A will be placed no closer than 1,200 feet to
any existing crossover. In cases where the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet has
classified the portion of U.S. 41A, abutting the property, as an Urban
Corridor, this distance may be reduced from 1,200 to 600 feet. Crossovers shall
be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and the Kentucky
Transportation Cabinet.
      (3)   The minimum width of entrances/exits at the property lines shall be
16 feet for a one-way entrance/exit and the maximum width shall be 36 for a
two-way entrance/exit.
      (4)   The minimum distance between entrances/exits shall be 65 feet. The
minimum distance between entrances/exits on sites that have frontage on U.S.
41A shall be 100 feet. In such cases where that distance cannot be met, e.g.,
lot width, existing entrances/exits and the like, consideration is based upon
sound traffic circulation principals during the review and approval of the
development plan in coordination with the Kentucky Department of
Transportation.
      (5)   The minimum distance of any entrance/exit to property line shall be
seven feet.
      (6)   The minimum distance a driveway into a site shall be from a street
intersection shall be 35 feet measured from the nearest street right-of-way to
the nearest end of the curb radius. For streets intersecting with U.S. 41A the
minimum distance a driveway into a site shall be 100 feet measured from the
nearest street right-of-way to the nearest end of the curb radius.
      (7)   A traffic impact study shall be required when a land use
classification #7 (See §
158.403, Land Use Classification) is defined a SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT within
this district. The term SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT shall mean any development
which will generate 200 trips to or from the site during the development’s peak
hour. The traffic impact study will be utilized by the Planning Commission to
Evaluate the traffic circulation plan and how the proposed use’s increased
traffic will impact the surrounding area. A “significant development” of a land
use classification #7 shall be required to submit a traffic impact study. The
traffic impact study shall contain the following information:
         (a)   Study purpose and objectives;
         (b)   Description of the site and study area. Care should be taken to
include all known congested locations that may be impacted by the proposed
development;
         (c)   Anticipated nearby development;
         (d)   Documented trip generation for each land use and total trip
generation, including assumptions and reasoning, and the sources of trip
generation estimates for residential developments. Additionally, for
nonresidential development, any adjustments to trip generation rates to reflect
pass-by trips captured, mixed-use, walk-ins and the like should be justified in
the report;
         (e)   Trip distribution and assignment including methodology,
assumptions and reasoning underlying the distribution and assignment;
         (f)   Capacity and level of service determination during the peak or
critical periods for the full development year for all affected streets/roads
as measured from the boundary of the property to the first collector or
arterial intersection in both directions;
         (g)   Recommendations, if any, for site access and public
transportation improvements needed to maintain traffic flow to, from, within
and past the site at an acceptable and safe level of service (Level of Service
C, as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual, Special Report 209, Washington,
D.C.: Transportation Research Board, Latest Edition);
         (h)   Existing conditions in the area of the development to include
current annual average daily traffic (AADT) and peak hour traffic volume counts
on the adjacent road or roads and intersections (including turning movements),
existing level of service on roadways, and physical characteristics of the
subject roadways;
         (i)   Full development year traffic volumes (assuming full build out
and occupancy) composed of all of the following:
            1.   Existing traffic volumes;
            2.   Non-site traffic volume growth in the corridor between the
existing year and the full development; and
            3.   The traffic volume added by the proposed development.
         (j)   A description of any government initiated roadway/ intersection
improvements which have been assumed as being in place at full development;
         (k)   An assessment of the change in roadway and intersection
operating conditions resulting from the development traffic;
         (l)   If necessary, other factors should be analyzed: safety
neighborhood impacts, service and delivery access, pedestrian and bicycle
movements, adequacy of parking, traffic control needs, circulation patterns,
transit needs or impacts and so forth; and
         (m)   Statement as to the proposed improvements which will be at the
developer’s expense.
      (8)   The analysis should be presented in a straightforward and logical
sequence.
   (C)   Parking.
      (1)   All parking and off-street loading designs are subject to the
provisions established in §§
158.160 through
158.163, Off-Street Parking, Storage and Loading Requirements, of the
Hopkinsville Code of Ordinances, and shall be reviewed and approved in the
development plan.
      (2)   The entire parking area shall be paved with a permanent surface of
concrete, asphaltic cement, cobble stone, brick or grid paving and shall be
graded and drained in accordance with the approved storm water management plan.
Any unpaved area shall be landscaped with lawn or other acceptable landscaping
materials, maintained in a neat and orderly fashion at all times, and as
required in §§
158.210 through
158.228, Buffering and Landscaping, of the Hopkinsville Code of Ordinances and
division (E), Buffering, of this section.
      (3)   Parking areas with 50 or more parking spaces shall be divided by
landscaping buffers of at least five feet wide. The landscape buffer shall be
accordance with the planting schedule for the ten foot landscape easement in
this section, excluding the fence requirement.
      (4)   No parking area shall be placed in a required buffer distance or
landscape easement.
   (D)   Exterior lighting. The objective of the lighting guidelines is to
reduce the visual impact of large parking lots at night while accentuating the
image of developments. Toward that end, developers should concentrate on
effective
and creative lighting of architectural features, pedestrian walkways and
entries, main vehicular routes, signage and landscape elements.
      (1)   Exterior lighting proposed on the site shall be planned, erected
and maintained so light is downward facing, confined to the property and will
not cast direct light or glare upon adjacent properties or public rights-of-
way.
      (2)   Maximum height of lights will not exceed 30 feet.
      (3)   Maximum foot candle average illumination shall be five foot
candles. Listed below are the illumination levels and types to be used in this
district.

      (4)    All light fixtures shall be equipped with a cutoff or beveled
prism type that directs the casting of light to less than 90 degrees.
      (5)   Public decorative lighting, as defined in
Chapter 162 of Hopkinsville Code of Ordinances, installed by the developer
shall comply with the regulations and procedures set forth in the Maintenance
Ordinance for Public Improvements,
Chapter 162, Hopkinsville Code of Ordinances.
      (6)   No light fixture shall be placed in a required buffer distance or
landscape easement.
      (7)   All design concepts shall be reviewed and submitted with the
Development Plan. Design concepts shall contain the following:
         (a)   Lighting layout plan;
         (b)   Light fixture elevations;
         (c)   Lamp types;
         (d)   Uniformity ratios;
         (e)   Average maintained illumination in foot candles; and
         (f)   Certification from the design professional stating that the
design concept meets the guidelines within this section.
   (E)   Buffering.
      (1)   Buffer distance.
         (a)   Requirement. A proposed use, that after classification, is
determined to be an allowable use shall meet the required buffer distance and
landscape easement requirements as set forth in this section.
         (b)   Scenarios. The buffer distance is required for the proposed use
and shall be applied according to one of the five listed scenarios. When the
application of the buffer distance is questioned, the Planning Commission will
make the determination as to where to measure the buffer distance. The Planning
Commission decision can be appealed to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
            1.   Existing classification. When there are two existing
incompatible land use classifications separated by a common property line, the
property which physically develops first shall be required to observe the
buffer distance requirement. The buffer distance shall be measured from the
common property line to the structure. See §
158.401, Definitions, for the definition of a structure.
            2.   Amended classification. When a Land Use Classification is
amended and the change creates two incompatible uses which are separated by a
common property line, the property which physically develops first shall be
required to observe the buffer distance requirement. The buffer distance shall
be measured from the common property line to the structure. See §
158.401, Definitions, for the definition of a structure.
            3.   Mixed uses. When a Mixed Use Development Plan is submitted
which has incompatible uses or land use classifications, the owner/developer
will have the option to meet the buffer distance requirements between the
incompatible uses within the development. The incompatibility of uses or
classifications to adjoining properties to the mixed use development will be
required to adhere to the buffer distance requirements. The property which
develops first shall be required to observe the buffer distance requirement.
The buffer distance requirement shall be measured from the common property line
to the structure. See §
158.401, Definitions, for the definition of a structure.
            4.   Agricultural classifications. When a Land Use Classification #
8 piece of property is developed and the subsequent Land Use Classification is
incompatible to the Land Use Classification which is separated by a common
property line, the property which develops first shall be required to observe
the buffer distance requirement. The buffer distance requirement shall be
measured from the common property line to the structure. See §
158.401, Definitions, for the definition of a structure.
            5.   Nonconforming uses, structures or uses and structures. When an
existing nonconforming use, structure or use and structure is amended,
modified, enlarged or changed, which creates an incompatibility with adjoining
classifications separated by a common property line, the property owner will be
required to make an application for a conditional use permit to the Board of
Zoning Adjustment. The buffer distance requirement will be determined by the
Board and set forth as a condition in the conditional use permit.
            6.   Incompatibility. When a land use is proposed and the proposed
land use is incompatible with the existing land use classification of the
adjoining property owner, the required buffer distance can be reduced by
agreement between the affected property owners of record. The negotiated buffer
distance for each property shall be in writing and in a form which can be
recorded in the Christian County Clerk’s Office and shall run with the land.
The buffer distance will not be reduced to less than the minimum setback
required in the land use classification.
         (c)   Buffer distance determination. Buffer distance is required in
increments of 50 feet. Buffer distance requirements are determined by the
following buffer distance chart:
Buffer Distance Chart (Adjoining Use)
Use Classification 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Notes to table:
X denotes “Buffer distance not required”
 
         (d)   Use. The buffer distance shall not be used for any purpose. No
structures, buildings, accessory structures, parking lots, storage areas,
street lights, streets, drives, driveways, access points, signage, lights,
towers, antennas, display areas or any use as determined as incompatible by the
Planning Commission. The placement of the landscape easement is allowable
within the buffer distance. A transitional use may be placed in the buffer
distance if the requirements of this chapter are met.
      (2)   Landscape easement standards.
         (a)    Landscape easements shall be located on the side and rear lot
lines of developments extending to the lot boundary line. Landscape easements
shall not extend into or be located within any portion of an existing street
right-of-way.
         (b)   To determine requirement between two adjoining lots, the
following procedure shall be followed:
            1.   Identify the classification of use for proposed development
from §
158.403;
            2.   Identify the classification of use for each of the adjoining
uses from §
158.403; and
            3.   Determine the landscape easement requirement for those side
and rear lot lines or portion thereof on the parcel by referring to the
Landscape Easement Requirement Chart:

Notes to table:
X denotes “Landscape easement not required”
Landscape easement requirement denoted in increments of ten feet in
width
 
         (c)   Table “1”, Recommended Landscape Easement, denotes plant units
required for each variation of the landscape easement. Existing plant material
may be counted as contributing to the total landscape easement requirement.
(See
Chapter 158, Appendix E)
         (d)   Should a developed use increase in intensity from an approved
land use classification to a higher one (e.g., land use classification # 4 to
land use classification # 5), the Planning Commission shall, during the
development plan review process, determine if a landscape easement is needed
and if so to what extent and type.
         (e)   Should a scenario exist where the buffer distance is, by
agreement, reduced or eliminated, the Planning Commission shall, during the
development’s plan review process, determine if the landscape easement is
needed and if so to what extent and type. A scenario whereby the agreement for
the buffer distance is reduced or eliminated by the affected property owners,
the affected property owners may also negotiate and reduce or eliminate the
required landscape easement. The negotiated agreement for the reduction or
elimination of the landscape easement shall be in writing and in form which can
be recorded in the Christian County Clerk’s Office and shall run with the land.
         (f)   Plant materials. All plant materials required within a specified
landscape easement shall be planted to completion within six months from date
of approval of the development plan and thereafter be properly maintained.
            1.   Type of plants.
               a.   Deciduous trees. Maple, oak, birch, beech, linden, honey
locust, ash, gingko. Minimal allowable size of not less than two and one-half
inches in caliper.
               b.   Deciduous shrubs (shrub like trees) Dogwood, redbud,
flowering crab, hawthorn, magnolia, fruit (pear, cherry, plum, peach);
(Shrubs): honeysuckle, lilac, cotoneaster, forsythia, euonymus, hydrangea,
privet, sumac. Minimal allowable size of not less than one and one-half inches
in caliper.
               c.   Evergreens. Pine, fir, spruce, hemlock, juniper, yew,
arborvitae. Minimal allowable size of not less than one and one-half inches in
caliper.
            2.   Maintenance. Maintenance responsibility of a required
landscape easement shall remain with the owner of the property. Maintenance
shall consist of mowing, removal of litter and dead plant materials,
replacement of plant materials, and necessary pruning. Natural or human-made
water courses within a landscape easement shall be maintained as free flowing
and free of debris.
            3.   Flow of surface water. In no case shall any planting, berm,
wall or other buffering element be placed in such a manner as to obstruct,
divert or otherwise impede the flow of surface water through any platted
easement or natural drain. No planting, berm, wall or other buffering element
shall be placed in any retention and/or detention basin. In cases where utility
easement, drainage easements or basins constitute a width greater than 50% of
the required width of the landscape easement, said landscape easement shall be
increased.
            4.   Open storage. All open storage of merchandise, material and
equipment shall be screened by adequate ornamental fencing or evergreen
planting at the side or rear of the lot. Maximum screening shall be ten feet in
height. All screening designs shall be reviewed and approved in the development
plan. No storage of merchandise, material and equipment shall be placed in a
required landscape easement or buffer distance.
            5.   Transitional use. In such situations where a transitional use
is proposed between two incompatible land use classifications for buffering
purposes and different property owners are involved, the transitional use shall
be developed prior to the development of the incompatible use or uses.
   (F)   Additional restrictions within SUD 41A. An overlay zone is created and
shall be designated on the official zoning map as follows:
      (1)   APZ, Accident Potential Zone;
      (2)   DNL-II, Day-Night Noise Level Zone II; and
      (3)   DNL-III, Day-Night Noise Level Zone III.

Notes to table:
(1) Use is not allowable if it involves the lodging of people (transient
lodging, hotels, motels, recreational vehicle parks, camp grounds).
(2) Use is not allowable if it involves a large concentration of people. A
large concentration of people is defined as a gathering of individuals in an
area that would result in an average density of greater than 25 people per acre
per hour during a 24-hour period, or a single event that would result in the
gathering of 50 or more individuals per acre at any one time. Density averages
shall be calculated per Ft. Campbell JLUS, Joint Land Use Study, dated January
1996.
DNL < 45 Interior Day Night Noise Level of < 45dB. Noise attenuation measures
incorporated into the construction of the building to bring the interior DNL to
< (less than or equal to) 45dB.
 
   (H)   Land within the overlay zone APZ, DNL-II or DNL-III may not be used
for any purpose other than those indicated by the approved development plan and
under the conditions attached thereto. Property owners should consult both the
text of this chapter, the Official Zoning Map and the Fort Campbell Joint Land
Use Study (JLUS), January 1996, to determine the location of properties in
question and the limitations imposed thereon by this chapter.
      (1)   All construction must meet the minimum requirements of the Kentucky
Building Code. Residential developments shall be designed and constructed to
provide, wherever possible, for the location of outdoor activity areas, such as
balconies and patios, on the side of the building which is sheltered from the
aircraft flight path. In the designated DNL-II and DNL-III, residential
dwellings may be constructed provided.
         (a)   Sound attenuation features are built into the dwelling to bring
the interior DNL of the living unit to 45 decibels or below. The architect and
the contractor shall provide certification of compliance for sound attenuation
features and construction; and
         (b)   The contents and covenants of deeds identifies the property as
being located near an airport and in a DNL-II or DNL-III zone, and the aircraft
noise may affect normal livability, value and marketability of the property.
      (2)   In the APZ, residential developments and limited high density uses
are prohibited due to the high probability of aircraft accidents occurring (See
Table II, this section).
      (3)   All lights or illumination used in conjunction with street, parking
signs or use of land and structures shall be arranged and operated in such a
manner that is not misleading or dangerous to aircraft operating in the
vicinity.
      (4)   No allowable, proposed, transitional or special use of any type
shall produce smoke, glare or other visual hazards within three miles of any
useable runway.
      (5)   No allowable, proposed, transitional or special use of any type
shall produce electronic interference with navigation signals or radio.
      (6)   No allowable, proposed, transitional or special use shall promote
the gathering, feeding or roosting of birds within 10,000 feet of any runway.
      (7)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or any other
ordinance, property owners or their agent proposing to erect or alter any
structure that may affect the navigable airspace shall notify the Federal
Aviation Administration in accordance with FAA Advisory Circular # 70/7460-2
(Appendix 1) and amendments thereto. Structure lighting shall be installed on
the structure in accordance with the specific standards established in FAA

   (A)   The regulations prescribed by this section shall not be construed to
require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or
use not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date hereof, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing
herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration or
intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which has
begun.
   (B)   Structures deemed nonconforming at the time of adoption of this
chapter are permitted to alter or make additions to the original structure
provided such additions or alterations receive a conditional use permit as
approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

actions of the applicant;
         (d)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that negatively impacts other land, structures or
buildings in the immediate vicinity; and
         (e)   In situations where the lot size is smaller than the required
buffer distance and strict enforcement of the buffer distance would eliminate a
proposed use and agreements to reduce the buffer requirements can not be
obtained with all the adjoining property owners, the Board of Zoning Adjustment
may through the dimensional variance process reduce the buffer distance to less
than 50% of the required distance.
   (C)   A variance shall not be granted unless the Board makes specific
findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it,
which support conclusions that the standards and conditions imposed by this
section, of this chapter have been met by the applicant.

§ 158.534 SMALL CELL TOWER LOCATION AND DESIGN REGULATIONS.
   A new small cell system is subject to design review and approval by staff.
The design criteria required for the new small cell systems is determined by
the type of location or zoning district in which the facility is to be located.
   (A)   New small cell system tower locations in all zoning districts. The
regulations in this division apply to all new small cell system towers.
      (1)   Temporary, mobile or wheeled cellular antenna towers to provide
short term, high volume telecommunications services to a specific location are
required to receive a temporary structure permit prior to siting of the
equipment. In the case of temporary cellular antenna tower placements that have
a duration not to exceed 15 days, the staff may provide an expedited review of
the proposed placement.
      (2)   New small cell towers shall not exceed the maximum building height
for the zoning district within which they are located. A height that is in
excess of what is permitted within the zoning district may be approved through
the granting of a dimensional variance by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
      (3)   New small cell towers shall be designed and constructed to
accommodate a minimum of two service providers;
      (4)   New small cell towers may be located on public or private
nonresidential land or within a public right-of-way provided it does not
interfere with other utilities, functionality of sidewalks, visibility, or
other matters of public safety;
      (5)   New small cell towers shall not be illuminated, except in accord
with state or federal regulations, or unless illumination is integral to the
stealth technology, such as a design intended to look like a streetlight pole;
      (6)   New small cell towers shall not include advertisements and may only
display information required by a federal agency, state agency, or the city.
Such display shall not exceed one square foot in area, unless required by state
or federal regulations, or unless a larger display is integral to the stealth
technology. Such display shall not exceed the width of the pole, unless a wider
sign is integral to the stealth technology such as a design which integrates a
decorative banner;
      (7)   If a new small cell tower is located in an area with primarily
underground utilities, or where no adjacent overhead utility lines exist, it
shall not utilize overhead utility lines.
   (B)   New small cell system tower locations in residential zones. The
regulations in this division apply to small cell towers to be located within,
or immediately adjacent to, residential zoning districts as defined in this
chapter.
      (1)   Facilities in residential areas are strongly encouraged to be non-
tower wireless communication facilities, which are exempt from these
regulations per this chapter.
      (2)   New small cell towers and antenna or related equipment shall be
camouflaged by stealth technology. Examples of appropriate stealth technology
for residential areas includes, at a minimum, towers with all cables, wires,
transmission equipment, electric meters, power equipment, etc. installed inside
the small cell tower. Other types of stealth technology or other methods which
will reduce the visual impact may be approved by staff.
      (3)   All poles and antennas shall be uniform grey or black in color,
unless another color is integral to the stealth technology as approved by
staff.
      (4)   The use of cooling fans is discouraged. When needed, fans with
lower noise profiles must be used.
      (5)   New small cell towers should avoid areas without overhead
utilities. If a small cell tower is located in an area with primarily
underground utilities it must adhere to stealth technology that incorporates
the telecommunications equipment into a streetscape amenity such as a
decorative lamp post, streetlight or other approved design. In areas with
overhead utilities, cylindrical antennas are required.
      (6)   In residential areas, a small cell tower shall not be located
closer than the height of the proposed tower to an existing or proposed
residential structure, or no closer than 35 feet, whichever is greater.
      (7)   Efforts should be made to locate new small cell towers in the yard
location where other overhead utilities are located.
      (8)   New small cell towers within residential areas should be located to
avoid obstructing the view of building facades by placing the tower at a
corner, intersection or along a lot line.
      (9)   New small cell towers shall not be located within 500 feet of an
existing small cell system tower. Multiple carriers are permitted and
encouraged to locate on one tower, where possible.
      (10)   Reasonable efforts shall be made to locate new small cell towers
in the order of hierarchy below, based on the following functional roadway
classification from the most to least preferred:
         (a)   Interstate;
         (b)   Arterial;
         (c)   Collector;
         (d)   Local.
   (C)   New small cell system tower locations in non-residential zones. The
regulations in this division apply to towers to be located within non-
residential zoning districts.
      (1)   In instances where a facility is proposed to be constructed in the
right of way within 100 feet of a residential zone or use, even if the
antenna's physical location is within a non-residential zone, regulations in
this division shall be followed.
      (2)   Antennas in commercial, institutional, or park areas are encouraged
to be installed as non-tower wireless communication facilities, which are
exempt from this regulation per this chapter.
      (3)   Reasonable effort shall be given to locate new equipment based upon
the following hierarchy of zones and land uses from the most to least
preferred:
         (a)   Co-locate on an existing structure whenever possible, which is
exempt from these regulations, per this chapter.
         (b)   Institutional;
         (c)   Industrial;
         (d)   Commercial;
         (e)   Public parks;
         (f)   Agricultural.
      (4)   Equipment cabinets/shrouds/enclosures not integrated into a pole or
mounted on a cable strand may not exceed seven cubic feet in volume, 24 inches
in width, 12 inches in depth, and should be mounted directly behind any road
signs located on a pole. Equipment cabinets and associated components should
not block any road signs. The design of non-integrated equipment cabinets/
shrouds should be slim in profile to match the pole. Ground mounted equipment
boxes should be screened from view with shrubs or other appropriate screening
as approved by staff.
      (5)   Shrouds, risers, and conduits shall be used to reduce the
appearance of external cabling.
      (6)   All poles, antennas, brackets, cabling, risers, shrouds, and
conduits shall be uniform grey or black in color, or other color as approved by
staff.
      (7)   Cylindrical antennas shall be required, unless another antenna
style is integral to the stealth technology as approved by staff.
      (8)   There shall be no more than a four-inch offset between the pole and

members shall have demonstrated interest in historic preservation, and at least
two of the five core members shall have training or experience in preservation
related professional, architecture, history, archaeology, architectural

designated or own property in the area designated. Any auxiliary member who
moves from the historic district or sells their last parcel of property in the
historic district shall be replaced 60 days after the action. A replacement for
the vacant term will require a majority vote by the property owners in the
designated historic area. Failure of the area designated as a specific historic

vacant term. Initial appointment of the auxiliary members shall have the
following staggered terms:
 
One member One year
One member Two years

or have interest in the property in question.
   (C)   Commission members appointed to the Commission after the initial
staggered terms will serve four years.

structure in a historic district, the Commission shall discuss with the
applicant alternatives to demolition. The Commission may ask interested
individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to
demolition. After a public hearing, the Commission may decide that a building
or structure in a historic district may be demolished because it does not
contribute to the historic district. If the Commission decided that the
demolition application shall be denied, the Commission shall study whether the
landmark or the property in the historic district can be put to reasonable
beneficial use and document the alternative use. The Commission may ask
applicants for additional information to be used in making these
determinations. These determinations shall be in addition to the points
contained in division (D) above. If economic hardship or a lack of reasonable
return is not proved, the Commission shall deny the demolition application
unless the Commission finds to grant the demolition application under the
points contained in division (D) above.
   (F)   When an applicant wishes to construct a new structure within a
designated landmark or historic district, the Commission will require plans
showing the external facade and scale of the new structure for review. After a

division (D) above, deny the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness based
on division (D) above, or make recommendations based on criteria found in
division (D) above.
   (G)   (1)   When an applicant wishes to move a landmark or a building in a
historic district or when an applicant wishes to move a building to a property
in a historic district, the Commission shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing and base a decision on the contribution
the building or structure makes to its present setting;
         (b)   Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated;
         (c)   Whether the building or structure can be moved without
significant damage to its physical integrity; and
         (d)   The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed
site and adjacent properties.
      (2)   These conditions shall be in addition to the points contained in
division (D) above. The Commission with either approve, deny or make
recommendations.
   (H)   The applicant shall have an appeal to the Circuit Court from a
decision of the Commission on an application for a certificate of
appropriateness.
   (I)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work is listed in the standards
developed in §
160.21.
   (J)   In any case where the Building Inspector determines that there are
emergency conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting a
landmark, a landmark zone or a property in a historic zone, he or she may order
the remedying of these conditions without the approval of the Commission. The
Building Inspector shall promptly notify the Chairperson of the Commission of
the action being taken.
   (K)   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall
conform to the provision of the certificate. It shall be the responsibility of

§ 163.04 RETALIATORY CONDUCT PROHIBITED.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for a landlord to retaliate by increasing rent or
decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for
possession after the tenant has made a good faith complaint to a Code
Enforcement Officer or other governmental agency of a violation of this chapter
applicable to the rented premises. In order to qualify as a good faith
complaint pursuant to this section, said complaint shall be communicated by the
tenant to the landlord in writing prior to filing said complaint with a Code
Enforcement Officer or other governmental agency, and said complaint results in
a Notice of Violation.
   (B)   If a landlord is in violation of division (A) of this section, the
tenant may recover possession or terminate the rental agreement and, in either
case, recover an amount not less than $150 and not more than $900. If the
rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return all prepaid rent. In
an action by or against the tenant, evidence of a good faith complaint within
six months before the alleged act of retaliation creates a presumption that the
landlord's conduct was in retaliation. The presumption of retaliation shall
continue for a period of six months after the landlord completes any required
repairs pursuant to the Basic Property Maintenance Code and as certified by a
code enforcement officer. The presumption does not arise if the tenant made the
complaint after notice of a proposed rent increase or diminution of services.
"Presumption" means that the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact
presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding
of its nonexistence. The prevailing party in any action filed pursuant to this
section shall be entitled to recovery of reasonable attorney fees not to exceed
$500.
   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) of this section, a landlord may
bring an action for possession if:
      (1)   The violation of the applicable Basic Property Maintenance Code was
caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant or other person in
his household or upon the premises with his consent; or
      (2)   The lease has expired on its terms; or
      (3)   The tenant is in default in rent; or
      (4)   Compliance with the Basic Property Maintenance Code or any other
applicable building or housing code requires alteration, remodeling, or
demolition which would effectively deprive the tenant of use of the dwelling
unit.
   (D)   The maintenance of an action under division (C) of this section does
not release the landlord from liability under division (B) of this section.
(Ord. 02-2016, passed 2-16-2016)
§ 163.99 PENALTY; ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter may be enforced by the Code of
Ordinance Enforcement Board established in §§
33.180 through
33.196, or in the alternative, the Christian County District Court, as a
misdemeanor and/or violation. The decision on whether enforcement shall take
place with the Code Enforcement Board or the Christian County District Court
shall be at the city’s discretion.

result in a fine of not greater than $1,000. All other offenses shall result in

§ 164.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Post-Construction Water Quality Ordinance
for the City of Hopkinsville, Kentucky.
(Ord. 17-2012, passed 11-20-2012)
§ 164.02 PURPOSE.
   To fully comply with federally mandated stormwater regulations of the
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), the City of
Hopkinsville is required to address stormwater runoff from areas after
construction is completed. Post-construction stormwater management in areas
undergoing new development or redevelopment is necessary because runoff from
these areas has been shown to significantly affect receiving water bodies.
Prior planning and design for the minimization of pollutants in post-
construction stormwater discharges is a cost effective approach to stormwater
quality management.
(Ord. 17-2012, passed 11-20-2012)
§ 164.03 AUTHORITY.
   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is empowered to regulate storm
water by the authority of The Clean Water Act. The City of Hopkinsville,
classified as a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) under Phase II of
the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Storm Water
Program, is empowered to regulate non-storm water discharges.
(Ord. 17-2012, passed 11-20-2012)

(Ord. 17-2012, passed 11-20-2012)
§ 164.05 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   For construction for development or redevelopment meeting the criteria
herein below, review and approval is required prior to commencement of
construction:
      (1)   Disturb more than one acre.
      (2)   Land uses which have a high potential of pollutant discharge into
the MS4 including, but not limited to, the following:
         (a)   Automobile service stations;
         (b)   Automobile and truck repair garages;
         (c)   Restaurants with grease collection and disposal; and
         (d)   Other land uses as determined to have a high potential of
pollutant discharge into the MS4 as determined by the Flood Safety Officer.
   (B)   Review of Stormwater Management Plans and Issuance of Permits.
      (1) For projects meeting the above criteria and requiring post
construction, stormwater management plans that fully address post-construction
water quality shall be submitted as part of the application process. The plans
shall conform to the design criteria set forth in the most recent version of
the City of Hopkinsville Stormwater Design and Best Management Practices
Manual, the capacity of which shall be designed to accommodate the quantity,
flow, and discharge for the 80th percentile, 24-hour storm event. Design shall
require, in combination or alone, management measures that are designed, built
and maintained to treat, filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen,
evapotranspire, harvest and reuse stormwater runoff, or otherwise manage the
stormwater runoff quality. This manual is available online at www.hopkinsville-
stormwater.com.
      (2)   Based on the review of the stormwater management plan, the SSWU
will:
         (a)   Approve the stormwater management plan and issue appropriate
permits;
         (b)   Approve the stormwater management plan subject to such
conditions as may be necessary to meet the requirements/intents of the
objectives of the chapter, and issue appropriate permit subject to these
conditions; or
         (c)   Deny the stormwater management plan, indicating the reason(s)
and procedure for submitting a revised stormwater management plan.
      (3)   The SSWU reserves the right to inspect the site prior to any
construction activity in furtherance of the review process.
      (4)   The SSWU approval of the stormwater management plan is for
compliance with local requirements and the KYDOW general permit. The designer
and/or owner/developer is ultimately responsible for the details of design,
with the property owner being responsible for implementation.
      (5)   For projects that cannot meet this water-quality treatment
standard, the property owner may use either off-site mitigation and/or payment-
in-lieu.
         (a)   The off-site mitigation option entails infiltration/
evapotranspiration/reuse measures that may be implemented at another location
in the same HUC 11 watershed as the original project, under a design submitted
by the property owner and approved by the SSWU. The SSWU shall identify
priority areas within the watershed in which mitigation projects can be
completed. Easements shall be obtained from all affected property owners, and
Deed Restrictions shall be filed indicating responsibility of perpetual
maintenance. The SSWU may assume perpetual maintenance only when there is a
significant public purpose.
         (b)    The payment-in-lieu option allows the owner/operator of a
construction site that disturbs at least one acre or a project that is less
than one acre but is part of larger common plan of development or sale to
choose to make a payment to the SSWU, in lieu of implementing post-construction
BMPs. The SSWU shall apply these in-lieu funds to a public stormwater quality
project.
            The amount of Payment in Lieu shall be 100% of the design and
installation of required post-construction facilities for the proposed
development. The amount shall be submitted by the developer for review and
approval by the SSWU.
(Ord. 17-2012, passed 11-20-2012) Penalty, see §
164.99
§ 164.06 MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The property owner/developer/applicant shall be responsible for all
maintenance and record keeping as detailed in the most recent version of the
City of Hopkinsville Stormwater Design and Best Management Practices Manual and
as set forth in
Chapter 54 of the Code of Ordinances.
   (B)   Pursuant to
Chapter 54 of the Code of Ordinances, a Maintenance Agreement shall be executed
before final approval of the stormwater management plan and issuance of any
permits. A copy of the Maintenance Agreement may be found in the City of
Hopkinsville Stormwater Design and Best Management Practices Manual.
(Ord. 17-2012, passed 11-20-2012) Penalty, see §
164.99
§ 164.07 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   As set forth in
Chapter 54 of the Code of Ordinances, the SSWU shall have right of entry to
inspect, observe, test or perform any related activity to the operation,
maintenance and function of the stormwater facility.
(Ord. 17-2012, passed 11-20-2012)
§ 164.08 APPEALS.
   (A)   An appeal of the final decision of the Flood Safety Officer may be
made to the SSWU, unless enforcement has occurred directly through the Code of
Ordinance Enforcement Board, which provides an appeal process to the Christian
County District Court.
   (B)   The appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the decision by filing,
with the Flood Safety Officer and with the SSWU, a notice of appeal specifying
the grounds upon which the appeal is being taken. The Flood Safety Officer
shall transmit to the SSWU all the papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken. At the public hearing on the appeal held by
the SSWU, any interested person may appear and enter his or her appearance, and
all shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
   (C)   The SSWU shall hold a public hearing within 45 days after the receipt
of an application for an appeal from the Flood Safety Officer or an applicant.
However, the public hearing shall not be held sooner than 14 days after its
receipt.
   (D)   Before holding the public hearing, notice of the hearing shall be
given in one or more newspapers of general circulation of the city at least 14
days before the date of the hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and
place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed appeal.
   (E)   Each adjoining property owner shall be contacted in writing prior to
the public hearing. Notice shall be mailed by the chairperson of the SSWU, or
duly appointed representative, by registered mail, at least 14 days before the
day of the hearing to all parties in interest. The notice shall contain the
same information as required of notices published in newspapers as specified in
division (D) above.
   (F)   Within 30 days after the public hearing required in this chapter, the
SSWU shall either approve; approve with supplementary conditions; or disapprove
the request for appeal.
   (G)   Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prevent any adversely
affected individual, entity or official of the city from appealing a decision
of the SSWU to the courts as provided in state law. Any person or entity
claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any final action of the SSWU shall file
the appeal within 30 days of the SSWU’s written decision.
(Ord. 17-2012, passed 11-20-2012)
§ 164.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall subject
the offending party (owner/developer/applicant) to the enforcement and
penalties herein set forth.
   (B)   Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with the implementation, enforcement and operation
shall constitute an offense under this chapter and shall result in a fine.
   (C)   The provisions of this chapter may be enforced by the Code of
Ordinance Enforcement Board established in §
33.180 et seq. and/or violation through the powers delegated to the SSWU or its
designated agent, and/or in the alternative, the Christian County District
Court as a misdemeanor and/or violation.
   (D)   Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of
its requirements shall be fined not more than $500 nor less than $100.
   (E)   Each day such violation continues after receipt of a notice of
violation shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein shall prevent
the SSWU from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.
