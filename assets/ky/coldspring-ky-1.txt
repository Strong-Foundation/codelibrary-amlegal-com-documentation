ordinance, that if any part of the ordinance be held unconstitutional the
remaining parts shall remain in force, unless the ordinance provides otherwise,

and dependent upon the unconstitutional part that it is apparent that Council
would not have enacted the remaining parts, standing alone, are incomplete and
incapable of being executed in accordance with the intent of Council.
(KRS 446.090)
§ 10.08 REVIVOR.
   (A)   A repealed ordinance without a delayed effective date is revived when

enactment of a repealer of the ordinance that repealed it at the same or any
subsequent meeting of Council as long as it takes effect prior to the effective
date of the original repealer.
   (C)   An amended ordinance without a delayed effective date remains
unchanged with respect to an amendment which is repealed at the same meeting of
Council which enacted the amendment.
   (D)   An amended ordinance with a delayed effective date remains unchanged
with respect to that amendment if the ordinance making the amendment is
repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of Council as long as the
repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the original
amendment.
   (E)   No other action of Council repealing a repealer or an amendment shall
have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or amendment
as the case may be.
(KRS 446.100)
§ 10.09 RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES ACCRUING BEFORE REPEAL OF ORDINANCE.
   No new ordinance shall be construed to repeal a former ordinance as to any
offense committed against a former ordinance, nor as to any act done, or
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred, or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 34.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)   As defined in §
34.01, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
34.12, any resident of the Commonwealth shall have the right to inspect public
records. The official custodian may require a written application, signed by
the applicant and with his or her name printed legibly on the application,
describing the records to be inspected. The official custodian may require the
applicant to provide a statement in the written application of the manner in
which the applicant is a resident of the Commonwealth under the definition of
“resident of the Commonwealth” in §
34.01.
      (1)   The written application shall be:
         (a)   Hand delivered;
         (b)   Mailed;
         (c)   Sent via facsimile; or
         (d)   Sent via email to the public agency’s official custodian of
public records or his or her designee at the email address designated in the
public agency’s rules and regulations adopted pursuant to KRS 61.876.
      (2)   A public agency shall not require the use of any particular form
for the submission of an open records request, but shall accept for any request
the standardized form developed under KRS 61.876(4).
(KRS 61.872 (2))
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a resident of the Commonwealth’s
request is in compliance with the open records law and the requested records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection. Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the
City Clerk for the inspection. No resident of the Commonwealth shall remove
original copies of public records from the offices of any public agency without
the written permission of the official custodian of the record.
(KRS 61.872(1)).
   (C)   A resident of the Commonwealth may inspect public records:
      (1)   During the regular business hours of the public agency; or
      (2)   By receiving copies of the public records from the city through the
mail if the applicant's residence or principal place of business is outside of
the county in which the city is located and he or she has precisely described
public records which are available within the city. If the resident of the
Commonwealth requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed,
the official custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the
cost of mailing.
(KRS 61.872(3)).
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
34.01.
(KRS 61.874(1))
   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than eight and one-half (8½) inches x eleven (11) inches in at least one (1)
color on white paper, or for electronic format, in a flat file electronic
American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the
public agency maintains electronic public records in a format other than ASCII,
and this format conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records
may be provided in this alternate electronic format for standard fees as
specified by the public agency. Any request for a public record in a form other
than the forms described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized
request.
(KRS 61.874(2)(b))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation, purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874 (4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874 (5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).
(KRS 61.874(6))
§ 34.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk/Treasurer does not have custody or control of the public
record or records requested, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall so notify the
applicant and shall furnish the name and location of the custodian of the
public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 34.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed five (5) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence. (KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian's authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
(KRS 61.880(1))
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.
§ 34.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.
   No official or employee of the city shall willfully conceal or destroy any
record with the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these rules
and regulations.

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication.
Unless exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted
under this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a

STORMWATER CREDIT POLICY
§ 52.001 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The city has established a credit policy for non-residential
properties. This policy provides an incentive to non-residential property
owners who conduct good stewardship practices that benefit the operation and
maintenance of the city stormwater collection system and improve water quality.
It is the intent of the city to encourage non-residential property owners to
reduce their stormwater bills by developing stormwater management practices
that reduce the negative impacts of urban development.
   (B)   The property owner/customer can reduce the amount of water quality
charges being assessed to their respective property by performing activities
that reduce stormwater volume and improve downstream stormwater quality.
Credits are offered for performing the following activities:
      (1)   Reducing the impact of stormwater (either quantity or quality) for
a particular property to an acceptable standard; and/or
      (2)   Reducing the stormwater cost of service to the city by performing
activities on accepted properties that otherwise would have to be performed by
and be the responsibility of city staff.
   (C)   Sanitation District #1 manages a regional stormwater program that has
developed the following documents:
      (1)   Northern Kentucky Regional Storm Water Management Program Credit
Policy.
      (2)   Northern Kentucky Regional Storm Water Management Program Credit
Application.
      (3)   Northern Kentucky Regional Storm Water Management Program Rules and
Regulations.
      (4)   Storm Water Best Management Practices Manual - Sanitation District
No. 1 of Northern Kentucky.
   (D)   Once a credit is established and approved by the City Stormwater
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), an annual maintenance update will need to
be submitted by the property owner/customer as an on-going verification that
the best management practices, or BMPs, are being maintained and are in good
working order.
   (E)   Because local engineers, contractors, developers, and non-residential
property owners have been using the documents listed above for a number of
years and because the city needs a technical basis for their credits program,
it is the intent of the city to use the Northern Kentucky Regional Storm Water
Management Program Rules and Regulations, and Storm Water Best Management
Practices Manual - Sanitation District No. 1 of Northern Kentucky as support
documents for the city credits program.
   (F)   The city is retaining some of the SD1 credit criteria. The water
quantity credit criteria will remain the same to protect downstream areas from
hydromodification. Water quality credit criteria has been slightly modified by
suggesting a number of core management practices from the Storm Water Best
Management Practices Manual - Sanitation District No. 1 of Northern Kentucky.
Additional education credits are also available for educational institutions.
New credit options that are available include gravel areas, and water quality
LEED credits.

(Ord. 14-1003, passed 5-12-14)
§ 52.006 AVAILABILITY AND CREDIT PERCENTAGE ALLOWED.
   (A)   Water quantity credit. This credit has been retained from the SD1
credits program. Water quantity credits are available for properties that
address hydromodification of receiving watercourses by controlling the rate at
which post-development stormwater flow is discharged from the site. Credits are
available for discharging post-construction stormwater flow at a rate equal to
or less than the critical flow (Qcritical) of the receiving watercourse. Unless
specific data is available for the receiving watercourse, Qcritical shall be
0.4 cubic feet per second (cfs) per acre for up to a two-year, 24-hour storm
event using SCS Type II rainfall distribution. The maximum allowable credit
available for reducing post-construction stormwater flow rates to Qcritical is
40%.
   (B)   Water quality credit.
      (1)   Water quality credits are available for properties that implement
post-construction facilities, best management practices (BMP), green management
practices (GMP) or low impact development (LID). The city is suggesting ten
management practices from the Storm Water Best Management Practices Manual -
Sanitation District No. 1 of Northern Kentucky that may be desirable for the
city. The ten practices are listed below and the best management practices
manual has the selection, design, construction, and maintenance criteria and
standards to implement these practices. There are other practices contained in
the BMP manual that may be used, however, the practices listed below should be
considered first. The core management practices and the percentage credit
available are as follows:
Core management practice Percentage credit available
Core management practice            Percentage credit available
Biofiltration swale                 10%
Bioretention/rain garden            20%
Extended detention basin (dry pond) 30%
Gravity separator                   30%
Permeable pavement                  20%
Planter box                         20%
Retention basin/wet pond            40%
Street trees                        10%
Subsurface vaults                   30%
Vegetated filter strip              10%
 
      (2)   The city will consider other management practices (BMPs, GMPs,
LID), however, they must be approved by the City Stormwater Department.
   (C)   Education credit. Education credits are available for educational
institutions such as public schools, private schools, colleges and
universities. Organizations must develop and annually implement a city water
quality educational program that addresses specific environmental issues at the
expense of the applicant. The maximum credit percentage for education is 50%.
   (D)   Gravel credit. The city stormwater district considers all compacted
gravel areas (drives, storage areas, and the like) as impervious areas, and
includes these surfaces in calculating the stormwater fee. The city
acknowledges that gravel surfaces do allow for the infiltration of stormwater
flow in a slightly different manner than imperious surfaces. Therefore, an
allowance for gravel surfaces on a case-by-case basis for these surfaces will
be offered. It is up to the non-residential property owner of these properties
to submit a credit application in order to receive credit for gravel surfaces.
The credit shall only apply to the gravel area of the property and not all
impervious areas of the site. The gravel credit is subject to an on-site review
to be performed by the city to make the final determination prior to any credit
approval. The maximum credit percentage for gravel is 10%.
   (E)   Water quality LEED credits. Developments and parcel owners within the
city that have been awarded the LEED® certification (based on the U.S. Green
Building Council, Inc. LEED® Certified Development Rules and Regulations) that
have earned credits from the LEED certification process may also qualify for a
credit reduction regarding the stormwater charge if the following criteria are
met (submission of the LEED certification notice to validate the application
and measure the amount of stormwater control is required to be submitted in
conjunction with this stormwater credit application). Please refer to the LEED
website for more information at http://www.usgbc.org/.
      (1)   The sustainable sites category of stormwater design quantity
control contained in the LEED certification process may be eligible for a 25%
reduction in the stormwater charge; and/or
      (2)   Stormwater design quality control rate and quantity reduction
contained in the LEED certification process may be eligible for up to a 50%
reduction in the stormwater charge (with the assumption that a 50% maximum
credit is allowed per property as described above).
(Ord. 14-1003, passed 5-12-14)
§ 52.007 MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   The owner/applicant of the management practice is responsible for the
inspection and maintenance of the stormwater management practice as well as the
submittal of the annual maintenance update.
   (B)   Prior to the submittal of a credit application, the stormwater
management practices shall be constructed in compliance with:
      (1)   Approved plans.
      (2)   The practice must function as designed.
      (3)   The practice must be properly maintained.
   (C)   Maintenance deficiencies should be corrected within a short period of
time. A longer period of time for corrections may be granted if any structural
and/or construction-related deficiencies are found during inspection. All
management practice deficiencies shall be corrected or addressed prior to the
approval of any credit.
   (D)   The city may perform periodic evaluations of the management practices
and education programs. City staff will perform inspections on at least 20% of
parcels receiving credit per year. This will allow staff to inspect 100% of the
parcels receiving credit every five years. These evaluations will ensure that
the management practices are being maintained and functioning as intended and
that educational programs are meeting their targeted audience and subject
objectives. If a management practice or education program fails an evaluation,
a notice will be sent to the property owner stating that improvements and/or
corrections need to be made. If adequate improvements and/or corrections to the
management practice or education program in question are not completed or
addressed within the time frame specified in the notice, the credit shall be
rescinded. The city may grant an extension for completion of improvements or
corrections upon request. In order to reinstate the credit, the owner must
reapply using the procedures required by the city.

§ 52.024 CREDIT SUMMARY.
   The city stormwater program staff will review and assign a stormwater credit
in 5% increments with a maximum of 50% credit to any one property.
   (A)   Water quantity credit (maximum credit: 40%). This credit has been
retained from the SD1 credits program. Water quantity credits are available for
properties that address hydromodification of receiving watercourses by
controlling the rate at which post-development stormwater flow is discharged
from the site. Credits are available for discharging post-construction
stormwater flow at a rate equal to or less than the critical flow (Qcritical)
of the receiving watercourse. Unless specific data is available for the
receiving watercourse, Qcritical shall be 0.4 cubic feet per second (cfs) per
acre for up to a two-year, 24-hour storm event using SCS Type II rainfall
distribution.
   (B)   Water quality credits (maximum credit: see list below).
      (1)   The water quality credits are offered to properties that perform an
activity or activities that reduce the burden on the water quality system. This
will include natural as well as manmade water quality system structures that
are properly maintained and are operating for the purposes of water quality and
water quantity benefits, and to reduce the burden on the city-maintained storm
system. The basis for this credit is:
         (a)   The City of Cold Spring, Official Subdivision Regulations.
         (b)   Northern Kentucky Regional Storm Water Management Program Rules
and Regulations.
         (c)   Storm Water Best Management Practices Manual - Sanitation
District No. 1 of Northern Kentucky.
         (d)   Stormwater Management Handbook - Implementing Green
Infrastructure in Northern Kentucky Communities.
      (2)   Water quality credits are available for properties that implement
post-construction facilities, best management practices (BMP), green management
practices (GMP) or low impact development (LID). The city is suggesting ten
management practices from the Storm Water Best Management Practices Manual -
Sanitation District No. 1 of Northern Kentucky that may be desirable for the
city. The ten practices are listed below and the best management practices
manual has the selection, design, construction, and maintenance criteria and
standards to implement these practices. There are other practices contained in
the BMP manual that may be used, however, the practices listed below should be
considered first.

   (C)   Gravel credit (maximum credit: 10%). The city stormwater district
considers all compacted gravel areas (drives, storage areas, and the like) as
impervious areas, and includes these surfaces in calculating the storm water
fee. The city acknowledges that gravel surfaces do allow for the infiltration
of stormwater flow in a slightly different manner than impervious surfaces.
Therefore, an allowance for gravel surfaces on a case-by-case basis for these
surfaces will be offered. It is up to the non-residential property owner of
these properties to submit a credit application in order to receive credit for
gravel surfaces. The credit shall only apply to the gravel area of the property

and watershed management) type education programs to students. To obtain this
credit, public and private schools are required to teach a water quality
curriculum supplied by the Kentucky Department of Transportation (KDOT).
      (3)   Stormwater education credits of 50% of the stormwater bill can be
granted for approved programs providing public awareness and education on
stormwater issues as follows:
         (a)   This credit is available to all schools as defined in the zoning
code, public or private, that offer a compulsory education curriculum for
grades K through 12 or part thereof.
         (b)   Where a site is jointly used by a school and another use (e.g.
church), the stormwater fee will be prorated based on usage and the credit will
be issued to the school portion of the fee only.
         (c)   Water quality educational curriculum for public/private schools
shall utilize a water curriculum in grade levels to be jointly agreed upon by
the schools and the city.
         (d)   Schools will conduct at least one school-wide awareness activity
to be chosen from a water festival day, poster contest, or litter collection
day. Additional opportunities include a stenciling project, brochure
development, public service announcements, videos, or other projects as
approved by city staff.
         (e)   In order to receive educational credits, the school shall submit
an application and provide supporting documentation. The application will be
due by July 1 of the preceding year the credit is to be given. The plan shall
be reviewed and approved by the city prior to implementation of the curriculum.
Once approved, the credit shall be applied to the appropriate stormwater bill.
         (f)   Upon completion of the educational curriculum and no later than
the end of the school year, the school shall submit an annual report indicating
compliance with the approved plan. The annual report shall be broken down by
the activity type and indicate the number of participants. If the school did
not substantially comply with the plan, the report will include an explanation
of the failure and any needed corrective action. Additional reporting
requirements may be required as part of the plan approval and shall be included
in the annual report.
         (g)   The city will review the annual report. If upon review, the
school did not substantially comply with the approved plan, the city may:
            1.   Require additional activities as a corrective action;
            2.   Reduce the education credit to a level comparable to
compliance; or
            3.   Refuse approval of any new education plan.
   (E)   Water quality LEED credits (maximum credit: 50%).
      (1)   Developments and parcel owners within the city that have been
awarded the LEED® Certified (based on the U.S. Green Building Council, Inc.
LEED® Certified Development Rules and Regulations) that have earned credits
from the LEED certification process may also qualify for a credit reduction
regarding their stormwater charge if the following criteria are met (submission
of the LEED certification notice to validate the application and measure the
amount of stormwater control is required to be submitted in conjunction with
this stormwater credit application). Please refer to the LEED website for more
information at http://www.usqbc.org/
         (a)   The sustainable sites category of stormwater design quantity
control contained in the LEED certification process may be eligible for a 25%
reduction in the stormwater charge; and/or
         (b)   Stormwater design quality control rate and quantity reduction
contained in the LEED certification process may be eligible for up to a 50%
reduction in the stormwater charge (with the assumption that a 50% maximum
credit is allowed per property as described above).
      (2)   LEED sustainable sites.
         (a)   Choosing a building's site and managing that site during
construction are important considerations for a project's sustainability. The
sustainable sites category discourages development on previously undeveloped
land, minimizes a building's impact on ecosystems and waterways, encourages
regionally appropriate landscaping, rewards smart transportation choices,
controls stormwater runoff, and reduces erosion, light pollution, heat island
effect and construction-related pollution.
         (b)   A 25% reduction in the stormwater fee may be achieved if the
site controls stormwater runoff and erosion is reduced based on the LEED
certification program.
      (3)   LEED stormwater management: rate and quantity reduction.
         (a)   Have a stormwater management plan in place over the performance
period that is designed to mitigate runoff from the site. Mitigated stormwater
is the volume of precipitation falling on the site that does not become runoff
by leaving the site via means of uncontrolled surface streams, rivers, drains,
or sewers. This mitigation can be accomplished through a variety of measures
including perviousness of site, stormwater management practices (structural and
non-structural), capture of rainwater for reuse or other measures.
            1.   Have measures in place on the site that mitigates at least 25%
of the annual stormwater falling on the site.
            2.   Have measures in place on the site that mitigates at least 50%
of the annual stormwater falling on the site.
            3.   A 25% reduction in the stormwater fee may be achieved only if
division 1 above meets the LEED certification process and then an additional
25% for a total of 50% reduction can be achieved if division 2 above also meets
the LEED rate and quantity reduction certification process.
         (b)   If there are questions regarding the U.S. Green Building
Council, Inc. LEED® certification process, please visit the LEED website at:

§ 52.026 ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Annual reporting is required by all credit recipients to maintain the
service fee reduction. The annual maintenance report (included in the
appendices of this chapter) describing the status, operation and maintenance of
each management practice is to be submitted to the City Stormwater TAC no later
than December 31 in order to maintain the credit reduction for the following
year. The school systems need to submit the educational credit annual report by
no later than May 1 for the following year in order to include in the next
year’s school’s class curriculum. Failure to submit the annual report will
result in cancellation of the credit. In addition, the city reserves the right
to periodically inspect the credited management practice to assure city
requirements are being followed. The annual report will generally require the
following information:
      (1)   Refer to and complete the application contained in the appendices
at the end of this document;
      (2)   Parcel number located on the real estate property tax bill
statement;
      (3)   Applicant statement certifying that the conditions under which the
credit was originally issued have substantially remained the same;
      (4)   Applicant statement certifying that if structural management
practices are receiving credit, they are being inspected and maintained within
appropriate standards for the management practice;
      (5)   Summary of regular inspection results; and
      (6)   Summary of maintenance activities.
   (B)   Submit annual maintenance reports to:

CREDIT PROGRAM REVIEW FEES
§ 52.040 INTRODUCTION.
   The city has developed a stormwater finance program for the management of
stormwater. As a part of this, a credits program was developed to provide an
incentive to non-residential customers to develop management practices that
will assist the city in reducing flooding and increasing water quality. The
credit program is described in the city credits program manual that can be
found on the city’s web site. It is important that the applications receive a
complete review so that the management practices provide a value to the
community. This subchapter presents the fees for the review of the credit
applications and management practices.
(Ord. 14-1003, passed 5-12-14)
§ 52.041 STORMWATER CREDIT PROGRAM REVIEW FEES.
   (A)   The table below is a chart of fees for the review of credits for the
city stormwater program. The city credits manual provides the credit policies,
credit mechanisms and credit procedures. Additionally, it is important for the
designer to use the following documents:
      (1)   Northern Kentucky Regional Storm Water Management Program Rules and
Regulations.
      (2)   Storm Water Best Management Practices Manual - Sanitation District
No. 1 of Northern Kentucky.
   (B)   In the credits review fee table below, there are three columns; the
credit item, the credit sub-item and the review fee. The credit items are the
five credit areas:
      (1)   Water quantity credit;
      (2)   Water quality credit;
      (3)   Educational credit;
      (4)   Gravel credit; and
      (5)   Water quality LEEDS credit.
   (C)   The sub-items are in the water quality credit and are the core water
quality practices of:
      (1)   Biofiltration swale;
      (2)   Bioretention/rain garden;
      (3)   Extended detention basin (dry pond);
      (4)   Gravity separator;
      (5)   Permeable pavement;
      (6)   Planter box;
      (7)   Retention basin/wet pond;
      (8)   Street trees;
      (9)   Subsurface vaults;
      (10)   Vegetated filter strip
   (D)   There are two other items in the sub-item column: Non-core water
quality management practices and water quality management practices not listed
in the best management practice manual. There are other management practices
that are listed in the stormwater best practices manual but are not listed as a
part of the core water quality management practices. These practices, while not
the primary desire of the city, are still viable and acceptable management
practices. The city is also allowing for management practices that are not in
the best management practice manual. These practices must be in accordance with
good engineering practice and thoroughly reviewed by the Stormwater Technical
Advisory Committee.
   (E)   There are no fees shown for educational credit because the city has
adopted the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet Water Quality Educational Program.
This credit is for public and private educational institutions.
   (F)   Each of the fees has a similar structure. There is a lump sum first
submittal fee to be paid when the application is delivered to the City Clerk.
If after the review of the submittal there are no questions or comments and the
application is approved and there are no other fees. If, however, the
application is not acceptable and additional submittals are required, then an
hourly fee will be used to review those submittals.
   (G)   City stormwater credit review fees.

(Ord. 14-1002, passed 4-28-14)
§ 52.061 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The Code
Enforcement Board may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the Code Enforcement Board may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.
      (1)   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subchapter
may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce
an illicit discharge. The Code Enforcement Board will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Code
Enforcement Board for a reconsideration and hearing.
      (2)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
Code Enforcement Board.
(Ord. 14-1002, passed 4-28-14)
§ 52.062 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity KPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the Code Enforcement Board prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 14-1002, passed 4-28-14)
§ 52.063 INSPECTION AND MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The Code Enforcement Board shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Code Enforcement Board.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Code Enforcement Board ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of a
KPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   The Code Enforcement Board shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Code
Enforcement Board to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
      (4)   The Code Enforcement Board has the right to require the discharger
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Code Enforcement Board and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Code Enforcement Board access
to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of
this subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a KPDES permit
to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense
if the person denies the Code Enforcement Board reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this subchapter.
      (7)   If the Code Enforcement Board has been refused access to any part
of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the Code Enforcement Board
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the MS4 municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of
these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with
the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 14-1002, passed 4-28-14)
§ 52.065 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 14-1002, passed 4-28-14)
§ 52.066 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency responsefor a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Code
Enforcement Board in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the Code Enforcement Board within three business
days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.
(Ord. 14-1002, passed 4-28-14)
§ 52.067 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
   Any of the following enforcement remedies and penalties, to be applied
independently or in a sequence as deemed necessary, shall be available to the
city in response to violations of this subchapter.
   (A)   Notice of violation. Enforcement proceedings for this subchapter shall
be initiated by the issuance of a notice of violation (NOV) by the Code
Enforcement Board. Failure to remedy the violation within seven days of receipt
of the notice of violation shall result in a citation for a civil offense. Each
day such violation continues after receipt of a citation shall be considered a
separate offense. The civil administrative fine for each citation (violation)
of this subchapter shall be not less the $100 and not more than $1,000. The
civil fine shall be paid directly to the city. The party cited may appeal the
citation and request a hearing before the City Code Enforcement Board as set
forth in Ordinance 05-876 and all amendments thereto. The issuance and
collection of all civil offenses shall also be governed under Ordinance 05-876
and all amendments thereto. The city may also obtain injunctions or abatement
orders to insure compliance with this subchapter or pursue administrative
remedies.
   (B)   Legal proceedings; notification of Kentucky Division of Water. The
Code Enforcement Board may pursue appropriate legal proceedings for the
enforcement of this subchapter, and the city shall be entitled to recover its
costs expended and reasonable attorney's fees in such proceedings. If the
person, property, or facility has or is required to have a stormwater discharge
permit from KDOW, the city shall notify the appropriate state authorities of
the violation.
   (C)   Revocation of permit, improvement or development plans. Permits,
improvement plans or development plan approvals may be revoked for any
substantial departure from the approved plans thereby resulting in an illicit
discharge as defined herein.
   (D)   Stop work orders. For violations involving active construction sites,
the Code Enforcement Board may issue a stop work order and require that all
activities cease, except those actions that are necessary to eliminate the
illicit discharge.
   (E)   Suspension of MS4 access due to illicit discharges in emergency
situations. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of persons, to the MS4, or to waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4, or waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
   (F)   Suspension of MS4 access due to the detection of illicit discharge.
Any entity discharging to the MS4 or any conveyance in violation of this
subchapter may have its MS4 access terminated in such that termination would
abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city shall require the violator to
disconnect access to the MS4 at their cost or take corrective action to
eliminate the source of the illicit discharge. Reinstatement of MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this chapter without the prior approval of the
city constitutes a violation.
   (G)   Cost of abatement of a violation. Any person causing a violation of
this subchapter which requires the city to expend public funds for the response
to the violation, its abatement or the cleanup or removal of any prohibited
discharges, pollutants or hazardous materials shall be liable to the city for
all recoverable fees and costs incurred by the city for such response, cleanup
and removal. This shall include but not be limited to personnel costs of any
city departments, or designated contractor costs, replacement costs of supplies
and equipment contaminated as a result of the discharge, proper disposal of
contaminated materials, cleanup, evacuation and administrative and other
expenses, including legal expenses, incurred in recovering such costs. Any such
illegal discharges shall be considered a public health hazard and the city
shall have a lien against the property for its recoverable costs if these costs
are not paid within 90 days of invoice.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE SYSTEM
§ 52.085 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city maintains a system of the storm and surface water management
facilities including but not limited to inlets, conduits, manholes, channels,
ditches, drainage easements, retention and detention basins, infiltration
facilities, and other components, as well as natural waterways.
   (B)   This is commonly referred to as a municipal separate storm sewer
system or MS4 as defined in 401 KAR 5:002, § 1(188).
   (C)   The stormwater system in the city requires regular maintenance and
improvements.
   (D)   Stormwater quality is degraded due to erosion and the discharge of
nutrients, metals, oil, grease, toxic materials, and other substances into and
through the stormwater system.
   (E)   The public health, safety, and welfare are adversely affected by poor
ambient water quality and flooding.
   (F)   All real property in the city either uses or benefits from the
maintenance of the stormwater system.
   (G)   The extent of use of the stormwater system by each property is
dependent on factors that influence runoff, including land use and the amount
of impervious surface on the property.
   (H)   The cost of improving, maintaining, operating and monitoring the
stormwater system should be allocated, to the extent practicable, to all
property owners based on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of
their property on the stormwater management system.
   (I)   Management of the stormwater system to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare requires adequate revenues and it is in the interest of the
public to finance stormwater management adequately with a use fee system that
is reasonable and equitable so that each use of the system pays to the extent
to which they contribute to the need for it.
   (J)   The city is required to develop a stormwater quality program through
the NPDES Phase II Stormwater Program that is required by state and federal
law.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.086 AUTHORITY.
   Authority for the adoption of this system of user fees to fund the
implementation of stormwater management programs is derived from KRS 91A.510
through KRS 91A.530, which allows for the adoption of a user fee for the city’s
stormwater quality program which the city is required to adopt through the
NPDES Phase II Stormwater Program that is an unfunded mandate by state and
federal law.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)

(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.088 ESTABLISHMENT OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FUND.
   (A)   The stormwater management program is established and the stormwater
system is provided to protect the waterways and land in the city by managing
flooding and to benefit the natural environment. The cost of designing,
developing, improving, operating, maintaining, and monitoring the stormwater
system required in the city should, therefore, be allocated to the extent
practicable, to all property owners based on their impact on the stormwater
system. In order to provide revenue to fund those costs and to fairly allocate
those costs, a stormwater management fund (the fund) is established.
   (B)   All revenues collected for the purpose of stormwater management from
user fees, grants, permit fees, and other charges collected under the chapter,
shall be deposited into the fund. The City Commission may make additional
appropriations to the fund. All disbursements from the fund shall be for the
purposes of the fund as set forth in this subchapter. Said fund shall be
administered per KRS 91A.530.
   (C)   Prior to the adoption of this subchapter, the city has expended
general fund dollars to begin the transition from Sanitation District No. 1 to
the city complying with the KPDES permit and other requirements. Said amounts
shall be itemized and submitted to the City Council for the reimbursement of
the general fund for dollars expended on stormwater services to date. Going
forward, any transfers from the general fund, for which reimbursement may be
sought, shall be first identified and approved by City Council.
   (D)   Nothing shall prohibit the city from seeking to borrow funds necessary
to fund the stormwater program set forth herein, either from a financial
institution and/or the city’s general fund.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.089 PURPOSES OF THE FUND.
   The fund shall be used for the following purposes:
   (A)   The acquisition by gift, purchase, or condemnation of real property,
and interests therein, necessary to construct, operate, and maintain stormwater
management facilities.
   (B)   All costs of administration and implementation of the stormwater
management program, including the establishment of reasonable operation and
capital reserves to meet unanticipated or emergency stormwater management
requirements.
   (C)   Engineering and design, debt services and related financing expenses,
construction costs for new facilities, and enlargement or improvement of
existing facilities.
   (D)   Operation and maintenance of the stormwater systems.
   (E)   Monitoring, surveillance, and inspection of stormwater control
devices.
   (F)   Water quality monitoring and water quality programs.
   (G)   Retrofitting developed areas for pollution control.
   (H)   Inspection and enforcement activities.

   (J)   Billing and administrative costs.
   (K)   Other activities which are reasonably required, including but not
limited to requirements set forth in the future by the Kentucky Division of
Water and/or Federal EPA.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.090 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   A monthly service fee is imposed upon all real property in the city,
beginning no earlier than October 1, 2013, to fund stormwater management
programs. This service fee shall be known as the stormwater management fee. Any
real property developed or added through annexation into the city after October
1, 2013, shall be subject to a monthly service fee. The fee is based on:
   (A)   The extent to which runoff from each property creates the need for the
stormwater management program;
   (B)   The amount of impervious area on each property; and
   (C)   The cost of implementing a stormwater management program.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.091 CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINATION OF THE
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   For purposes of determining the stormwater management fee, all properties in
the city are classified into one of the following classes:
   (A)   Single family residential (SFR) property. The city finds that the
contribution to runoff of most parcels of real property in the city classified
as singlefamily residential is similar and that it would be excessively and
unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the
improvements (such as building, structures, and other impervious areas) on each
parcel. Therefore, all single family residential properties in the city shall
be charged a flat stormwater management fee, equal to the base rate, as
provided in §
52.092. If an adjacent property is owned, but evident to be party of SFR (i.e.
adjacent thereto), the adjacent property shall not be considered non-developed
property.
   (B)   Non-single family residential (non-SFR). The fee for non-SFR property
in the city shall be the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained
by dividing the total impervious area (square feet) of the property by the ERU.
The impervious surface area for non-SFR property is the square footage for the
buildings and other improvements on the property. At the sole discretion of the
city, the impervious surface area of non-SFR property may be approximated
through site examination, mapping information, aerial photographs, and other
available information. The minimum stormwater management fee for non-SFR
property shall equal the base rate for single family residential property. As
set forth above, all condominium complexes in the city shall be classified as
non-SFR with a fee based on the complexes impervious surface area submitted to
the governing Homeowners Association Board (HOA). Said practice has been
occurring prior to by Sanitation District No. 1.
   (C)   Non-developed property. There shall be no fee for non-developed
property in the city.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.092 BASE RATE.
   The city engaged the services of environmental rate consultants to perform
an analysis of the average amount of impervious surface area for residential
properties in the city. The study resulted in an ERU of 3,000 square feet. A
monthly base rate for the stormwater management fee is established for all
single family residential property per the 3,000 ERU.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.093 SCHEDULE OF MONTHLY RATES FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   The following schedule of rates shall apply to each property owner. This
schedule includes the rate for the stormwater fees.
 
Rate category                 Rate per month
Single family residential     $4.50
Non-developed property        $0.00
                              $4.50
Non-single family residential Multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by
                              dividing the total impervious area (square feet)
                              of the property by one ERU.
 
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.094 FEE FOR TAX-EXEMPT PROPERTIES; EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The City Commission finds that all real property in the city
contributes to runoff and either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the
stormwater system. Therefore, all real property in the city, including property
that is tax-exempt from property tax per the Kentucky Revised Statutes, as
amended, shall be subject to the fee.
   (B)   Property which is owned by the city shall be subject to the fee. All
federal, state, county, and city roads are exempt from the fee and are
considered to be part of the city drainage systems.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.095 ASSESSMENT NOTICES.
   (A)   The city may, but is not required to, send assessment notices for the
fee to property owners prior to the billing for the fee.
   (B)   If assessment notices are sent, the notice shall include the following
information:
      (1)   The classification of the property for purposes of determining the
fee;
      (2)   For property classified as other developed property:
         (a)   The impervious surface area of the property; and
         (b)   The method by which the impervious surface area of the property
was determined, that is, whether the computation of the impervious surface area
of the property is based on information in the Campbell County Property
Valuation Office, site examination, mapping information, aerial photographs, or
other methods.
      (3)   The amount of the base rate (i.e. the single family residential
fee), and for other developed property, the number of base units on the
property.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.096 WHEN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE PAYABLE; PENALTIES; LIEN ON RENTAL
PROPERTY; ABATEMENT OF SMALL AMOUNTS DUE.
   (A)   The fee shall be billed by the city as set forth on the schedule
herein. The city makes the following findings regarding billing:
      (1)   Single family residential properties shall receive a single bill on
their yearly city property tax bill, in a manner identical to the current
garbage fees set by the city each year when the tax bills are issued. Said fees
shall represent the current year's fees (i.e. city bills in arrears of services
provided).
      (2)   All other properties subject to the fees set forth herein, shall be
billed quarterly, in arrears (i.e. a bill for Jan-March will be issued on or
about April 1). The city makes a finding that many commercial bills are in
excess of the single family residential and in order to continue to provide the
proper budgeting that the commercial properties have had with Sanitation
District No. 1 issuing quarterly bills, that said practice shall continue.
   (B)   If a bill is rendered to a party who is not the property owner and the
bill becomes unpaid and/or delinquent, then the property owner shall bear the
responsibility of payment.
   (C)   A delinquent fee that is not paid by the delinquency date shown on the
bill will incur a penalty of 10% of the bill. The delinquency date for single
family residential bills, as set forth in division (A)(1) shall be December 31
of each year in which the single bill was issued for all other properties’
bills, as set forth in division (A)(2) shall be 30 days after the date of
issuance. A 10% penalty shall be assessed if payment is not received by the
delinquency date.
   (D)    In addition to the 10% penalty for unpaid bills, all unpaid bills
shall also incur an interest penalty thereon at the rate of 12% per annum. Said
interest shall begin 30 days after the delinquency date and shall be assessed
against both the unpaid bill and penalty.
   (E)   If the city must file legal action to collect unpaid stormwater fees,
the responsible party shall also pay all applicable court costs incurred, as
well as attorney’s fees in the amount of $200 per hour, billed in increments of
ten minutes. The city makes a finding that said attorneys fee hourly amounts
are reasonable and commensurate with work performed insuring fees are paid
pursuant to this section.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13; Am. Ord. 16- 1025, passed 3-28-16)
§ 52.097 REQUEST FOR CORRECTION OF THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   (A)   A property owner may request correction of the fee by submitting the
request in writing to the office of the City Clerk within 30 days after the
date the assessment notice or the bill is mailed or issued to the property
owner. Grounds for correction of the fee include:
      (1)   Incorrect classification of the property for purposes of
determining the fee;
      (2)   Errors in the square footage of the impervious surface area of the
property;
      (3)   Mathematical errors in calculating the fee to be applied to the
property; and
      (4)   Errors in the identification of the property owner of a property
subject to the fee.
   (B)   The city shall make a determination within 60 days after the receipt
of the property owner's completed written request for correction of the fee.
The City Council's decision on a request for correction of the fee shall be
final.
   (C)   A property owner must comply with all rules and procedures adopted by
the city when submitting a request for correction of the fee and must provide
all information necessary for the city to make a determination on a request for
correction of the fee. If a property owner alleges an error under §
52.096(A)(2), the request for correction must include a certification by a
registered engineer or professional land surveyor of the impervious surface
area of the property. Failure to comply with the provisions of the subsection
shall be grounds for denial of the request.
(Ord. 13-998, passed 9-30-13)
§ 52.098 EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT.
   The equivalent residential unit for the city shall be 3,000 square feet.

edge of the said concrete paving and normal to the center line of the driveway
in accordance with common engineering practice.
   (F)   The width of the driveways for other than residential or dwelling,
house shall not exceed thirty (30) feet at the outer or street edge of the
sidewalk. Where two (2) or more adjoining driveways are provided for the same
property, a safety island of not less than ten (10) feet at the outer or street
side of the sidewalk shall be provided. Not more than two (2) such driveways
shall be allowed to any one owner for any one (1) piece of property on any one

the following criteria:
      (1)   The tree species is rare;
      (2)   The tree is more than one hundred (100) years of age;
      (3)   The tree has been connected with a significant historical event;
      (4)   The tree is of an outstanding trunk diameter, or drip line for a
tree of its species;

city.
   (C)   All trees designated as "landmark trees" by the Tree Commission shall
be shown on an official map with appropriate code marks signifying each tree's
designation, number, species, age and periodic monitoring.
   (D)   If the owner, or owners, of the property on which a landmark tree is
located, consent thereto, the Tree Commission may identify such tree as a
landmark tree by the placement of a suitable marker thereon. The cost of the
marker shall be underwritten by the property owner.
   (E)   Prior to the removal of any designated landmark tree, the Tree
Commission may suggest alternate building areas in an effort to preserve the
landmark tree. If, and when, any landmark tree is removed, the Tree Commission
shall arrange for the necessary changes to be made to the official landmark
tree inventory records and city map.
   (F)   The Tree Commission shall prepare, and submit, a list of trees to the
city staff suitable for planting in public right-of-way areas that are
conducive to growth in the Greater Cincinnati region. All city trees located on
property owned by the city, or on public right-of-ways, shall be maintained by
the city. The Tree Commission may be consulted with regard to the selection,
location and planting of trees that are to be placed on city property, or
right-of-way. When consulted, the Tree Commission shall check to ensure no
underground utilities exist in the area where a tree is to be planted.
   (G)   The Tree Commission shall bring to the attention of the city staff any
city tree that represents a threat to public safety when such tree is dead or
dying, and its presence could cause hardship or endanger the public, or any
adjoining property owner. The Tree Commission shall also notify the city when a
city tree is diseased or infested so as to be a danger to other trees within
the city. Further, the staff shall be notified by the Tree Commission when a

operations or otherwise interferes with traffic or pedestrian safety. In the
event the complete removal of a tree is not required, it may be pruned pursuant
to the requirements contained herein.
   (H)   Whenever development is to occur on city property when city trees are
affected, the Tree Commission shall be notified by the city to review the
development plans and make recommendations to the city that will minimize the
impact on the trees. Tree Commission recommendations should encourage tree
conservation whenever practical, or provide advice as to when tree removal is
more feasible. In determining whether tree removal may be necessary, the Tree
Commission should consider:
      (1)   Whether the presence of such tree would cause hardship, or endanger
the public or an adjoining property owner;
      (2)   Whether such tree is located in an area to be occupied by
buildings, driveways, recreation areas or other construction or within the drip
line of a tree;
      (3)   Whether such tree is located in an area to have a cut or fill of
land that may be injurious or dangerous to such tree.
   (I)   Any public utility serving the city with overhead services shall have
the right to remove city trees without the prior approval of the city only when
an emergency exists and when obtaining the prior approval of the city and/or
Tree Commission is not practical. All public utilities with overhead services
shall coordinate all non-emergency tree trimming activities with the city staff
and/or Tree Commission that are reasonably required for the purpose of
providing the appropriate utility service, or to avoid danger to the public or
overhead utility personnel or equipment pursuant to the requirements contained
in the franchise agreements as authorized by the City Council of the city. Any
other person(s) or firm, except the public utility with overhead lines having
line clearing operations (tree trimming) done by them, or for them by any
person(s) or firm, shall first obtain written approval from the city.

(4) inches or more in diameter;
      (6)   String or bury wires or lines through a public park.
   (B)   The city may grant such written permission if the activity for which
such permission is requested is in the public interest and it is not likely to
cause injury to any city tree. Any person, or persons, who cause damage to any
city tree(s) shall be held liable for damages to said tree(s).
   (C)   No person shall operate, place or maintain within the drip line of any
city tree, any machinery, equipment, heavy object, stone, rocks, cement, earth,

REQUIREMENTS
§ 98.30 PLANNING COMMISSION FUNCTION.
   All subdivision plans and development plans submitted for consideration to
the Planning Commission shall address the following items. The Planning
Commission shall have sole enforcement authority of this chapter as it relates
to subdivision plans and development plans.
(Ord. 94-666, passed 9-20-94)
§ 98.31 DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   (A)   The following requirements shall apply for all development plans
submitted for a development in all commercial, industrial, and professional
office zones and in the Special Development Areas (SDA) as to these type users.
      (1)   (a)   A tree inventory plan shall be submitted in conjunction with
all development plans for a development contained in § 98.31(A) of this
chapter.
         (b)   The tree inventory plan shall also identify any landmark tree(s)
and delineate the buildable area of a proposed development. The Planning
Commission may permit the removal of a tree outside the buildable area, with
the advice of the Tree Commission pursuant to the requirements contained
elsewhere in §
98.32, provided the removal of the tree is reasonably required to develop the
parcel in compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   (a)   All trees to be saved outside of the buildable area of a
development shall be conspicuously designated with suitable protective tree
barriers as designated herein or as otherwise approved by the zoning
administrator. Approved tree protective barriers shall be installed along the
outermost drip line around the tree protection zone. The use of tree protection
zones is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen)
trees that may be scattered throughout a development site.
         (b)   The layout of development improvements, utilities, access
drives, grading, etc., of a site shall accommodate the required tree protective
zones. The public improvements shall be placed along the corridors between tree
protective zones unless the placement of same causes undue hardship on the
developer as determined by the Planning Commission. If the Planning Commission
determines that public improvements and/or utilities may be placed within a
tree protective zone, the installation of same shall occur by way of tunneling
rather than trenching.
         (c)   Construction site activities including, but not limited to,
material storage, parking, or concrete washout shall not encroach into any tree
protection zone without the prior approval of the zoning administrator. Any
tree irreparably damaged or killed within a tree protection zone as a result of
construction activity, shall be removed and replaced by the owner and/or
developer at a rate of two (2) trees for every tree irreparably damaged or
killed.
         (d)   Protective tree barriers shall be installed to a minimum height
of four (4) feet above ground level around the outermost drip line of the tree
protection zone. Tree protection zones shall be delineated with typical
temporary construction fencing or continuous rope or flagging. In either case,
the tree protection barrier shall be accompanied by "Tree Save Area" signage to
be placed around the tree save zone not more than every twenty (20) feet.
      (3)   (a)   A tree planting plan shall also be submitted in conjunction
with the development plan submission. One (1) tree shall be planted on the
development site for every five (5) required parking spaces. Any tree planted
relative to the requirements contained herein shall not be less than three (3)
inches in diameter when planted.
         (b)   The tree planting plan shall indicate the total number and
species of tree to be planted within a proposed development along with the
intended location of same. Trees required to be planted by this chapter should
be planted predominantly in the developed areas, driveway aisles, and/or
parking areas of the project. In no case shall more than fifty percent (50%) of
the trees required to be planted be utilized to satisfy the screening
requirements of a development. The exact location of the trees to be planted
and species shall be approved by the Planning Commission after review of all
Tree Commission recommendations, as part of the Stage I review process.
Whenever the owner/developer can demonstrate to the Planning Commission that
the site spatial constraints result in an absolute inability to plant the
required number of trees, as many trees as possible shall be planted on the
site. The difference of those trees required to be planted, and those trees
planted, shall be donated to the city for use elsewhere in the city on public
property. A reduction credit of one (1) tree or more shall be granted to an

development four (4) to eight (8) inches in diameter.
   (B)   The following requirements shall apply for all development plans
submitted for a development in any multi-family zone, PUD zone, and RCD zone

         (b)   The tree inventory plan shall also identify any landmark tree(s)
and delineate the buildable area of a proposed development. The Planning
Commission may permit the removal of a tree outside the buildable area, with
the advice of the Tree Commission pursuant to the requirements contained
elsewhere in § 98.32, provided the removal of the tree is reasonably required
to develop the parcel in compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   (a)   All trees to be saved outside of the buildable area of a
development shall be conspicuously designated with suitable protective tree
barriers as designated herein or as otherwise approved by the zoning
administrator. Approved tree protective barriers shall be installed along the

trees that may be scattered throughout a development site.
         (b)   The layout of development improvements, utilities, access
drives, grading, etc., of a site shall accommodate the required tree protection
zones. The public improvements shall be placed along the corridors between tree
protective zones unless the placement of same causes undue hardship on the

tree protection zone, the installation of same shall occur by way of tunneling
rather than trenching.
         (c)   Construction site activities including, but not limited to,
material storage, parking or concrete washout shall not encroach into any tree
protection zone without the prior approval of the zoning administrator. Any
tree irreparably damaged or killed within a tree protection zone as a result of

for every tree irreparably damaged or killed.
         (d)   Protective tree barriers shall be installed to a minimum height
of four (4) feet above ground level around the outermost drip line of the tree
protection zone. Tree protection zones shall be delineated with typical
temporary construction fencing or continuous rope or flagging. In either case,

be placed around the tree save zone not more than every twenty (20) feet.
      (3)   (a)   A tree planting plan shall also be submitted in conjunction
with the development submission. One (1) tree shall be planted on the
development site for every one (1) unit approved. Any tree planted relative to
the requirements contained herein shall not be less than three (3) inches in
diameter when planted.
         (b)   The tree planting plan shall indicate the total number and
species of trees to be planted within a proposed development along with the
intended location of same. Trees required to be planted by this chapter should
be planted predominantly in the developed areas, driveway aisles, and/or
parking areas of the project. In no case shall more than fifty (50%) percent of
the trees required to be planted be utilized to satisfy the screening
requirements of a development. The exact location of the trees to be planted
and species shall be approved by the Planning Commission, after review of all
Tree Commission recommendations, as part of the Stage I review process.
Whenever the owner/developer can demonstrate to the Planning Commission that
the site spatial constraints result in an absolute inability to plant the
required number of trees, as many trees as possible shall be planted on the
site. The difference of those trees required to be planted and those trees
planted shall be donated to the city for use elsewhere in the city on public
property. A reduction credit for one (1) tree or more shall be granted to an
owner/developer when either of the following exist:
            1.   For every tree saved within the buildable area of a
development eight (8) inches or more in diameter, or
            2.   For every two (2) trees saved within the buildable area of a
development four (4) to eight (8) inches in diameter.
   (C)   The following requirements shall apply for all new subdivision plans
with multiple lots submitted for a subdivision in a CO zone, R-RE zone, all
single family zones and the Special Development Area (SDA) zones to these type
uses.
      (1)   (a)   A tree inventory plan shall be submitted in conjunction with
all subdivision plans for a subdivision contained in §
98.31(C) of this chapter.
         (b)   The tree inventory plan shall also identify any landmark tree(s)
and delineate the buildable area for each proposed subdivision lot. The
Planning Commission may permit the removal of any tree(s) outside the buildable
area of a subdivision lot with the advice of the Tree Commission pursuant to
the requirements contained elsewhere in §
98.32, provided the removal of the tree(s) is reasonably required to develop
the subdivision in compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   (a)   All trees to be saved outside the buildable area of a
subdivision lot shall be conspicuously designated with suitable protective tree
barriers as designated herein or as otherwise approved by the zoning
administrator. Approved tree protective barriers shall be installed along the
outermost drip line around the tree protection zone. The use of tree protection
zones is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen)
trees that may be scattered throughout an individual lot.
         (b)   The layout of the subdivision improvements, utilities,
driveways, etc., should accommodate the required tree protective zones.
Whenever practical, public improvements, utilities or driveways should be
placed along the corridors between tree protective zones. When public
improvements or utilities are placed within a tree protection zone,
installation of same shall occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching.
         (c)   Construction site activities including, but not limited to,
material storage, parking or concrete washout, shall not encroach into any tree
protection zone without the prior approval of the zoning administrator. Any
tree irreparably damaged or killed within a tree protection zone as a result of
construction activity shall be removed and replaced by the developer/owner at a
rate of two (2) trees for every tree irreparably damaged or killed.
         (d)   Protective tree barriers shall be installed to a minimum height
of four (4) feet above ground level around the outermost drip line of the tree
protection zone. The tree protection zones shall be delineated with typical
temporary construction fencing or continuous rope or flagging. In either case,
the tree protection barrier shall be accomplished by "Tree Save Area" signage
to be placed around the tree save zone not more than every twenty (20) feet.
      (3)   (a)   A tree planting plan shall also be submitted in conjunction
with the subdivision plan submission. One (1) tree shall be planted on each lot
for every five thousand (5,000) square feet of lot area or fraction thereof.
The tree(s) required to be planted on each lot may be planted on the lot or on
the public right-of-way in front of each lot. Any tree planted relative to the
requirements contained herein shall not be less than three (3) inches in
diameter when planted.
         (b)   The tree planting plan shall indicate the total number and
species of trees to be planted on each lot along with the intended location of
same. The exact location of the trees and species to be planted shall be
approved by the Planning Commission, after review of all Tree Commission
recommendations, as part of the Stage I review process. Whenever the owner/
developer can demonstrate to the Planning Commission that the spatial
constraints of a lot result in an absolute inability to plant the required
number of trees, as many trees as possible shall be planted on the lot. The
difference of those trees required to be planted and those trees planted shall
be donated to the city for use elsewhere in the city on public property. A
reduction credit of one (1) tree or more shall be granted to an owner/developer
when either of the following conditions exist:
            1.   For every tree saved within the buildable area of a lot eight
(8) inches or more in diameter, or
            2.   For every two (2) trees saved within the buildable area of lot
four (4) to eight (8) inches in diameter.

§ 155.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public
health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-
construction storm water runoff and non-point source pollution associated with
new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper
management of construction-related and post-construction storm water runoff
will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure,
safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare, protect water and
aquatic resources and establishes methods for controlling the introduction of
pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to
comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that protects
the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
   (B)   Minimizing changes to the pre-development hydrologic response for new
development and redevelopment in their post-construction state in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter for the applicable design storm in order
to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, and non-point and point source
pollution, as well as to maintain the integrity of stream channels, aquatic
habitats and healthy stream temperatures;
   (C)   Establishing minimum post-construction storm water management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of storm water
runoff quantity and quality;
   (D)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function, and use of structural storm water control facilities that may be used
to meet the minimum post-construction storm water management standards;
   (E)   Establishing criteria for the use of better management and site design
practices, such as the preservation of green space and other conservation
areas;
   (F)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural storm water best management
practices (BMPs) to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are
maintained appropriately, and pose minimum risk to public safety; and
   (G)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of storm water management plans, for the inspection of
approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.
