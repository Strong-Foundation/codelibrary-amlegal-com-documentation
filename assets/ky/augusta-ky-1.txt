unchanged with respect to an amendment which is repealed at the same meeting of
Councilwhich enacted the amendment.

with respect to that amendment if the ordinance making the amendment is
repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of Council as long as the
repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the original
amendment.
   (E)    No other action of Council repealing a repealer or an amendment shall
have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or amendment
as the case may be.
(KRS 446.100)
§ 10.09 RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES ACCRUING BEFORE REPEAL OF ORDINANCE.
   No new ordinance shall be construed to repeal a former ordinance as to any
offense committed against a former ordinance, nor as to any act done, or
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred, or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance

the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.

changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.

may assess such property in the same manner as for privately owned property or
it may pay the costs so apportioned out of general revenues.
(KRS 91A.230)
§ 33.13 COMPREHENSIVE REPORT REQUIRED.
   Before undertaking any improvements pursuant to this subchapter, the city
shall prepare a comprehensive report setting out:
   (A)   The nature of the improvement;
   (B)   The scope and the extent of the improvement, including the boundaries
or other description of the area to be assessed;
   (C)   The preliminary estimated cost of the improvement;
   (D)   The fair basis of assessment proposed;
   (E)   If financing of assessments is provided, the proposed method,
including the proposed years to maturity of any bonds to be issued in
connection with the improvement; and
   (F)   Such other information as may further explain material aspects of the
improvement, assessments, or financing.
(KRS 91A.240)
§ 33.14 PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED.
   After preparation of the report required by §
33.13, the city shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposed
improvement at which all interested persons shall be heard. Notice of the
hearing shall be published pursuant to KRS Chapter 424, and mailed to each
affected property owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall
include:
   (A)   The nature of the improvement;
   (B)   Description of area of the improvement;
   (C)   Statement that the city proposes to finance the improvement in whole
or in part by special assessment of property and the method to be used;

(KRS 91A.250)
§ 33.15 ADOPTION OF ORDINANCE; NOTICE TO AFFECTED OWNERS.
   Within 90 days of conclusion of the hearing, the city shall determine
whether to proceed with the improvement by special assessments, and if it
determines to proceed shall adopt an ordinance so stating and containing all
necessary terms, including the items referred to in §
33.13 and a description of all properties. Promptly upon passage the city shall
publish such ordinance pursuant to KRS Chapter 424 and shall mail by certified
mail to each affected property owner a notice of determination to proceed with
the project, the fair basis of assessment to be utilized, the estimated cost to
the property owner, and the ratio the cost to each property owner bears to the
total cost of the entire project.
(KRS 91A.260)
§ 33.16 AFFECTED OWNER MAY CONTEST.
   (A)   Within 30 days of the mailing of the notice provided for in §
33.15, any affected property owner may file an action in the circuit court of
the county, contesting the undertaking of the project by special assessment,
the inclusion of his property in the improvement, or the amount of his
assessment. If the action contests the undertaking of the improvement by the
special assessment method of the inclusion of the property of that property
owner, no further action on the improvement insofar as it relates to any
property owner who is a plaintiff shall be taken until the final judgment has
been entered.
   (B)   The city may proceed with the improvement with respect to any
properties whose owners have not filed or joined in an action as provided in
this section or who have contested only the amounts of their assessments, and
the provisions of the resolution are final and binding with respect to such
property owners except as to contested amounts of assessments. After the lapse
of time as herein provided, all actions by owners of properties are forever
barred.
(KRS 91A.270)
§ 33.17 WHEN CITY MAY PROCEED; ASSESSMENT CONSTITUTES LIEN.
   (A)   After the passage of time for the action provided for in §
33.16, or after favorable final judgment in any such action, whichever comes
later, the city may proceed with the improvement or part thereof stayed by the
action, including notice requiring payment of special assessment or installment
thereon and bonds or other method proposed to finance the improvement. The
first installment may be apportioned so that other payments will coincide with
payment of ad valorem taxes.
   (B)   The amount of any outstanding assessment or installments thereof on
any property, and accrued interest and other charges, constitutes a lien on the
property to secure payment to the bondholders or any other source of financing
of the improvement. The lien takes precedence over all other liens, whether
created prior to or subsequent to the publication of the ordinance, except a
lien for state and county taxes, general municipal taxes, and prior improvement
taxes, and is not defeated or postponed by any private or judicial sale, by any
mortgage, or by any error or mistake in the description of the property or in
the names of the owners. No error in the proceedings of the Council shall
exempt any benefited property from the lien for the improvement assessment, or
from payment thereof, or from the penalties or interest thereon, as herein
provided.
(KRS 91A.280)
§ 33.18 EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL PROPERTY OR CHANGE IN FINANCING.
   The city may undertake any further proceedings to carry out the improvement
or any extension or refinancing thereof, except that§ §
33.13 through
33.17 applies if additional property is included in the improvement or if
change is made in the method or period of financing; but additional property
may be included in the improvement with the consent of the owner thereof
without compliance with other sections if it does not increase the cost
apportioned to any other property, or any other change may be made without such
compliance if all property owners of the improvement consent.

   (A)   As defined in §
34.01, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
34.12, any resident of the Commonwealth desiring to inspect or copy the public
records of the city shall complete a written application for such records at
the office of the City Clerk/Treasurer during regular office hours, except
during legal holidays. The City Clerk/Treasurer may require the applicant to
provide a statement in the written application of the manner in which the
applicant is a resident of the Commonwealth under KRS 61.870. The written
application shall be hand delivered, mailed, or sent via facsimile or e-mail to
the City Clerk/Treasurer’s office. The City Clerk/Treasurer shall not require
the use of any particular form for the submission of an open records request,
but shall accept for any request the standardized form developed under KRS
61.876. (KRS 61.872(2))
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a resident of the Commonwealth’s
request is in compliance with the open records law and the requested records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection. Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the
City Clerk/Treasurer for the inspection. No resident of the Commonwealth shall
remove original copies of public records from the offices of any public agency
without the written permission of the official custodian of the record. (KRS
61.872(1))
   (C)   A resident of the Commonwealth may inspect public records during the
regular business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public
records from the city through the mail if the applicant’s residence or
principal place of business is outside of the county in which the city is
located and he has precisely described public records which are readily
available within the city. If the resident of the Commonwealth requesting the
public records requests that the records be mailed, the official custodian
shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of mailing. (KRS
61.872(3))
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
34.01 (KRS 61.874(1))
   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt pubic records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor’s requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request. (KRS
61.874(2)(b))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to product a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874(4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section; or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874(5)
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).
(KRS 61.874(6)
§ 34.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk/Treasurer does not have custody or control of the public
record or records requested, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall so notify the
applicant and shall furnish the name and location of the official custodian of
the agency’s public records.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 34.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall so immediately notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed five (5) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection. (KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records.
However, refusal under this section must be sustained by clear and convincing
evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   If a person enforces this chapter pursuant to this section, he shall
begin enforcement under this division before proceeding to enforcement under
division (B) of this section. The official custodian, upon any request for
records made under this chapter, shall determine, within five (5) days
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the receipt of any
request, whether to comply with the request and shall notify in writing the
person making the request within the five (5) day period of its decision. Any
agency response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record shall
include a statement of the specific exception authorizing the withholding of
the record and a brief explanation of how the exception applies to the record
withheld. The response shall be issued by the official custodian or under his
authority and shall constitute final agency action. (KRS 61.880(1))
   (B)   (1)   If a complaining party wishes the Attorney General to review a
public agency's denial of a request to inspect a public record, the complaining
party shall forward to the Attorney General a copy of the written request and a
copy of the written response denying inspection. If the public agency refuses
to provide a written response, a complaining party shall provide a copy of the
written request. The Attorney General shall review the request and denial and
issue within twenty (20) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays,
a written decision stating whether the agency violated the provisions of this
chapter.
         (2)   In unusual circumstances, the Attorney General may extend the
twenty (20) day time limit by sending written notice to the complaining party
and a copy to the denying agency, setting forth the reasons for the extension,
and the day on which a decision is expected to be issued, which shall not
exceed an additional thirty (30) work days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and
legal holidays. As used in this section, "UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES" means, but
only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper resolution of an appeal:
            (a)   The need to obtain additional documentation from the agency
or a copy of the records involved;
            (b)   The need to conduct extensive research on issues of first
impression; or
            (c)   An unmanageable increase in the number of appeals received by
the Attorney General.
         (3)   On the day that the Attorney General renders his decision, he
shall mail a copy to the agency and a copy to the person who requested the
record in question. The burden of proof in sustaining the action shall rest
with the agency, and the Attorney General may request additional documentation
from the agency for substantiation. The Attorney General may also request a
copy of the records involved, but they shall not be disclosed. (KRS 61.880(2))
   (C)   Each agency shall notify the Attorney General of any actions filed
against that agency in Circuit Court regarding the enforcement of this chapter.
The Attorney General shall not, however, be named as a party in any Circuit
Court actions regarding the enforcement of this chapter, nor shall he have any
duty to defend his decision in Circuit Court or any subsequent proceedings.
(KRS 61.880(3))
   (D)   If a person feels the intent of this chapter is being subverted by an
agency short of denial of inspection, including but not limited to the
imposition of excessive fees, delay past the five (5) day period described in
division (A) of this section, excessive extensions of time, or the misdirection
of the applicant, the person may complain in writing to the Attorney General,
and the complaint shall be subject to the same adjudicatory process as if the
record had been denied. (KRS 61.880(4))
   (E)   (1)   A party shall have thirty (30) days from the day that the
Attorney General renders his decision to appeal the decision. An appeal within
the thirty (30) day time limit shall be treated as if it were an action brought
under KRS 61.882.
         (2)   If an appeal is not filed within the thirty (30) day time limit,
the Attorney General's decision shall have the force and effect of law and
shall be enforceable in the Circuit Court of the county where the public agency
has its principal place of business or the Circuit Court of the county where
the public record is maintained. (KRS 61.880(5))
   (F)   Upon the Attorney General’s request, the agency will provide
additional documentation.
   (G)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General’s opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action. (KRS
61.882)
§ 34.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.
   No official or employee of the city shall willfully conceal or destroy any
record with the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these rules
and regulations.
§ 34.11 ACCESS TO RECORDS RELATING TO PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.
   Any person shall have access to any public record relating to him or in
which he is mentioned by name, upon presentation of appropriate identification,

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under
this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a

   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of this city depends upon

interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled.
   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.

it will be added to his existing bill for services, which will then be deemed
past due. No cut-on of any service will be made until all accounts with the
city are made current, including the cut-on fee, if applicable.
   (C)   In the event that a customer absconds, all accounts due, less any

§ 50.22 BUDGET PLAN FOR GAS BILLS.
   The following gas budget plan is hereby adopted to help prevent hardship due
to increased gas billings during the winter months:
   (A)   The plan will start with the gas bills sent to the customer on the
first of June of each year.
   (B)   The plan will use the average cubic feet used per month for the year
beginning April 15 of the prior year, and ending April 14 of the year of
application. This average usage will be multiplied by the rates in effect for
the month billed for. This will allow for changes in the rates over the year.
Thus, the budget payment will vary from month to month as the rates go up or
down.
   (C)   A signing-up period will be conducted during the month of May 1986,
and thereafter during the month of April of each year. Any gas customer must
sign up at this time if they wish to use this plan. No customer will be
permitted to sign up at any other time.
   (D)   Any extraordinary or extreme variation from the average in any month
will cause an adjustment in the monthly average usage.
   (E)   Each May, the average for each customer will be re-figured for the
coming year.
   (F)   The statement sent to the customer will include:
      (1)   The name and address of the customer.
      (2)   The date of reading.
      (3)   Previous and present readings.
      (4)   Usage.
      (5)   Actual billing and budget payment.
      (6)   A request to pay the applicable amount.
      (7)   The due date.
   (G)   All customers wishing to sign up must have lived in and been a gas
user at his present location for at least 12 months prior to the sign-up month
and must not have been delinquent on his utility account during that period.
   (H)   Late payments, cut-offs, etc. shall be dealt with under§ §
50.35 through
50.41.
   (I)    Any person whose service is cut off for nonpayment thereunder shall
be discontinued from the budget plan immediately and shall not be considered
for reinstatement to the plan until he or she again qualifies under divisions
(C) and (G) above.

§ 50.23 CHANGE IN GAS RATES; REFUNDS.
   (A)    Change in rate. Whenever a change occurs in the rates or charges of a
supplier of gas to the city constituting a change in cost of gas per MCF of the
city's gas sales, a determination shall be made as to the effect per MCF
billing unit of sales of such change in cost of gas.
      (1)    Such determination shall be made by:
         (a)    Application of the most recently effective rates or charges and
the new rates or charges to the city's average monthly volume of gas purchased
during the most recently available 12-month period.
         (b)    Dividing the cost of gas calculated in division (1)(a) above by
the number of billing units of gas sales during the same most recently
available 12-month period.
         (c)    Comparing the resultant quotients of the average cost per MCF
billing unit of gas sales from division (1)(b) above.
         (d)    The difference so derived to the nearest $.01 shall represent
the effect of changes in gas cost per MCF billing unit of sales.
      (2)    The current rates or charges of the city to its customers may be
decreased or increased by application of a gas cost adjustment as determined in
division (1) above in the discretion of the Mayor subject to rescission by
Council. The rates so adjusted shall be effective on the beginning date of the
billing period next commencing on and after the effective date of a change in
rates or charges of gas supplied to the city; however, in the case of metered
accounts, the adjusted rates shall become effective with meter readings taken
on and after the date 15 days subsequent to the date of the supplier increase
or decrease giving rise to such change.
   (B)    Refunds. When the city receives refunds from one or more of its
suppliers which shall have resulted from a reduction in rates or charges
applicable to prior periods and previously reflected in a change in rates under
this chapter, the city shall pass on such refunds to customers as hereinafter
described:
      (1)    Recompute, in the same manner as set forth in division (A) above,
each previously effective change in rates.
      (2)    Refund to its customers as a credit to each customer's bill over a
period not to exceed four months commencing not more than 60 days after the
date of receipt of the refund, an amount determined as follows:
         (a)    Apply the difference between the original billed change in rate
and the recomputed change in rate of division (B)(1) above to total sales for
the period of over-collection from all customers;
         (b)    Apportion any interest received in connection with supplier
refunds in the same ratio as the principal applicable to such customers; and
         (c)    Add the amounts determined in divisions (2)(a) and (b) above
(being the total dollar amount refundable) and divide such amount by the
estimate of total sales to all customers for the refund period specified in
division (B)(2) above, to determine the refund factor, which shall be
applicable to the volumes billed to customers each month.
         (d)    The company shall not be required to refund amounts for which
the associated credit factor would be less than 0.1c per MCF of total sales,
but will accumulate all refunds until the aggregate reaches an amount of 0.1c
per MCF.
         (e)    The refund factor as computed shall be adjusted, if necessary,
to insure refund of the total refund amount computed under division (B)(2)
above.

§ 50.37 CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH GAS SERVICE MAY BE DISCONTINUED.
   (A)    The city may discontinue gas service for nonpayment of bills after
ten days' notice. However, no utility shall discontinue service to any customer
for nonpayment of bills (including delayed charges) without first having made a
reasonable effort to induce the customer to pay same. The customer shall be
given at least ten days' written notice, but the cut-off shall not be effected
before 21 days after the mailing date of the original bill. The termination
notice shall be exclusive of and separate from the original bill. If prior to
discontinuance of service, there is delivered to the utility office payment of
the amount in arrears, then discontinuance of service shall not be made, or
where a written certificate is filed signed by a physician, a registered nurse,
or a public health officer stating that, in the opinion of the person making
the certificate, discontinuance of the service will aggravate an existing
illness or infirmity on the affected premises, service shall not be
discontinued until the affected resident can make other living arrangements or
until 30 days elapse from the time of the utility's notification to the
customer in writing of the existence of local, state, and federal programs,

other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)    Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned

sales factor, described in division (C), and the denominator of which is two
(2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C).
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.

factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is in the
United Sates government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease, or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the pity and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly

business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;

allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to

occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.

tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of

not be an exclusive use. All public improvement, including, but not limited to,
trees, light poles, traffic devices, utility covers, or any public maintenance
procedures, shall take precedence over said use of the public sidewalk at all
times.
   (D)   The licensee shall, in addition to all other requirements of law, take
reasonable steps to ensure that alcoholic beverages are consumed only by
patrons of the establishment who are of age, and not by passersby or persons
who are not of age or who are obviously or apparently intoxicated.

shall not permit any alcoholic beverages to be taken off of premises by
patrons, customers, or guests.

local laws regarding the sale, service and consumption of alcohol and the

filed with the City ABC Administrator evidence of insurance insuring the
licensee against liability imposed by law arising out of the ownership,
maintenance, and operation of such sidewalk café, in an amount to be
established by the City ABC Administrator. The City of Augusta shall be named
as an additional insured in such policy, providing such insurance and such

(Ord. 56-2, passed 8-23-56)
Penalty, see § 136.99
§ 136.02 CURFEW.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purposes of the section the following terms,
phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein. When
not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the
future, words in the plural number include the singular and words in the
singular number include the plural. The word “shall” is always mandatory and
not merely directory.
   “ALLOW.” Either permit or neglect to prevent conduct in violation hereto,
provided that the parent or guardian must have actual constructive knowledge of
the offending conduct. The parent or guardian must actually know that the minor
in his or her custody is violating this Ordinance or the circumstances must be
such that a reasonably prudent parent or guardian should have known that the
conduct of the minor was in violation of this section.
   “CITY.” The City of Augusta, Kentucky, with administrative offices at 219
Main Street, Augusta, Kentucky, 41002.
   “EMERGENCY.” An unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting
state that calls for immediate action. The term includes, but is not limited to
a man-made or natural disaster, automobile accident, or any situation requiring
immediate action to prevent bodily injury or loss of life.
   “ESTABLISHMENT.” Any privately owned place of business operated for profit
to which the public is invited, including but not limited to any place of
amusement or entertainment.
   “MINOR.” Any unemancipated person under 18 years of age.
   “OPERATOR.” Any individual, firm, association, partnership, corporation,
limited liability company, or other entity operating, managing, or conducting
any establishment. The term includes but is not limited to the members or
partners of an association, partnership or other entity and the officers of a
corporation.
   “PARENT.” Any person having legal custody of a minor;
      (1)   As a natural or adoptive parent;
      (2)   As a legal guardian;
      (3)   As a person who stands “in loco parentis”;
      (4)   As a person to whom legal custody has been given or directed by
order of the Court;
      (5)   As a person having physical possession and claims a right of
custody.
   “PUBLIC PLACE.” A place to which the public or a substantial group of
persons has access, and includes, but is not limited to, highways, streets,
alleyways, transportation facilities, schools, places of amusement, parks,
places of business, playgrounds and hallways, lobbies and other common areas of
apartment houses, hotels, hospitals, office buildings, shops, stores,
restaurants, ad other similar commercial establishments.
   “REMAIN.” To stay behind, to tarry, or linger upon or in any public place.
   “TIME OF NIGHT.” The prevailing standard of time, specifically, Eastern
Daylight Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the city; prima
facie the time then observed in the city administrative offices and police
station.
   “YEARS OF AGE.” From one birthday, such as the fifteenth to (but not
including) the day of the next, such as the sixteenth birthday, making it clear
that fifteen or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase
“under sixteen years of age,” the latter phrase in practice, unfortunately,
having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that sixteen
years might be involved. Similarly, for example, 11 or less years of age means
“under 12 years of age.”
   (B)   Curfew for minors established. It shall be unlawful for any person
under the age of eighteen to be or remain in or upon any public place within
the City during the hours between 10:00 p.m. on any Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. on the following day; and during the
hours between 12:00 midnight on Fridays and Saturdays and 6:00 a.m. the
following day. It shall be unlawful for any parent or guardian having legal
custody of a minor to allow such minor to be in or remain in or upon a public
place in the City under circumstances not constituting an exception as
enumerated below during the time period during the hours between 10:00 p.m. on
any Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. on the
following day; and during the hours between 12:00 midnight on Fridays and
Saturdays and 6:00 a.m. the following day.
   (C)   Exceptions. In the following exceptional cases, a minor, may be in, or
upon a public place in the city during the hours between 10:00 p.m. on any
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. on the following
day; and during the hours between 12:00 midnight on Fridays and Saturdays and
6:00 a.m. the following day.
      (1)   When the minor is accompanied by a parent or guardian;
      (2)   When the minor is accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent or
guardian;
      (3)   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech,
and the right of assembly, provided that written notice signed by the minor and
countersigned by the minor’s parent is in the possession of such minor
specifying when, where, and in what manner said minor will be exercising such
First Amendment rights;
      (4)   In the case of reasonable necessity demonstrated by the minor’s
parent or guardian such as necessity caused by illness in the family or
unavailability of an adult to make a trip to obtain needed items for the
family;
      (5)   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next door neighbor who has not
communicated an objection to a police officer or police department;
      (6)   When attending or returning home, by direct route from, and within

religious or other voluntary association, provided that justification
indicating the place and time of termination of said event can be given to any
investigating officer of the police department.
      (7)   When engaged in any lawful employment activity, or going to or
returning home from any lawful employment activity;
      (8)   When the minor, who is a duly authorized and licensed driver, is
operating a motor vehicle for the purpose of passing through, by direct route,
from one location to another, including all minors that may also be within the
vehicle.
      (9)   When involved in an emergency.
   (D)   Parental responsibility. It shall be unlawful for a parent to
knowingly permit or by inefficient control to allow the juvenile to remain in
any city public place under the circumstances not constituting an exception to,
or otherwise beyond the scope of, the section. The term “knowingly” includes
knowledge that a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the
whereabouts of a juvenile in that parent’s legal custody. This requirement is
intended to hold a neglectful or careless parent up to a reasonable community
standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall,
therefore, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the
activities or conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile.
   (E)   Operator responsibility. It shall be unlawful for any operator of an
establishment to knowingly permit a juvenile to remain at the establishment
under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the
scope of, the section. The term “knowingly” includes knowledge that an operator
should reasonably be expected to have concerning the patrons of the
establishment. The standard for “knowingly” shall be applied through an
objective test: whether a reasonable person in the operator’s position should
have known that the patron was a juvenile in violation of the section.
   (F)   Enforcement of curfew. 
      (1)   A police officer, upon finding or being notified of any minor in a
public place whose parent is believed to be in violation of this Ordinance, may
stop and question such minor and request such information as his or her name
and age and the name, address and number of his or her parent, guardian, or
person having legal custody.
      (2)   If the police officer determines or has reasonable cause to believe
that a curfew violation has occurred, the police officer may obtain from the
minor the information necessary to issue a citation to the minor’s parent,
guardian, or person having legal custody, and then take the minor to his or her
home, or direct the minor to proceed immediately to his or her home, or take
the minor to the Augusta Police Department until released to the parent,
guardian, person having legal custody. If the parent, guardian, or person
having legal custody does not appear within two hours from the time the minor
is taken into custody, the police shall follow the requirements set forth in
KRS Chapter 610 and other applicable provisions of the Kentucky Unified
Juvenile code.
   (G)   Construction and severability.
      (1)   Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of
this chapter. If any provision, including any exception, part, phrase, or term,
or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and
the validity of the chapter in any and all other respects shall not be affected
thereby.
      (2)   Advisory opinions.
         (a)   The Mayor, after consultation with the City Attorney, is hereby
authorized to give advisory opinions in writing, which shall be binding and
shall be adhered to by the police, until the section is amended in such
respect, interpreting terms, phrases, parts or any provisions. Normally such
advisory opinions shall be in response to good faith, signed letters addressed
to the Mayor or to a member of City Council, questioning the Curfew Ordinance
as:
            1.   Ambiguous;
            2.   Having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights
specifically invoked; or
            3.   Otherwise invalid, in all three categories with respect to
proposed conduct definitely described.
         (b)   This administrative remedy must be exhausted prior to presenting
to any court a question in any of the three categories. The City Council does
not intend a result through the enforcement of the section that is absurd,
impossible of execution or unreasonable. Council intends that the section be
held inapplicable in cases, if any, where its application would be
unconstitutional under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or
Constitution of the United States of America.
   (H)   Continuing evaluation. The City Council shall continue its evaluation
and updating of the section through methods including but not limited to:
      (1)   Within six months after the implementation of this section, the
Chief of Police shall provide the City Council with a report concerning the
effect of this section on crimes committed by and against minors, and of the
number of warnings issued and arrests of minors, parents, and operators
hereunder, and such other information as Council may request.
      (2)   On a regular basis, the City Council shall receive informal reports
of all exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity, the notices of
school and other activities, the special permits and the regulations authorized
above, and the advisory opinions for consideration by the Council in further
updating and continuing evaluation of the section.

of a felony, the court shall consider, among others, the following factors:

      (2)    The hardship likely to be imposed on the defendant's dependents by
the amount of the fine and the time and method of paying it;
      (3)    The impact the amount of the fine will have on the defendant's
ability to make reparation or restitution to the victim; and
      (4)    The amount of the defendant's gain, if any, derived from the
commission of the offense.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS 82.082 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Augusta, Bracken County, Kentucky,
hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 12-29-04; Am. Ord. 2013-01, passed 3-20-13; Am. Ord.
2023-5, passed 8-16-23)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 12-29-04; Am. Ord. 2013-01, passed 3-20-13; Am. Ord.
2023-5, passed 8-16-23)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 12-29-04; Am. Ord. 2013-01, passed 3-20-13; Am. Ord.
2023-5, passed 8-16-23)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.

same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. “ACCESSORY STRUCTURES” should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,

and general welfare. This includes areas downstream from dams.
   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).” A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the
regular program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures for protection from flooding.
   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. “CRITICAL FACILITIES” include, but are not

impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   “EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.” Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMs effective before that date. “EXISTING CONSTRUCTION” may also be referred
to as “EXISTING STRUCTURES.”
   “EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by a community.
   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   “FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD.” The flood that has a 0.2% (two-tenths percent)

      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      (3)   Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to
a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas,
as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of
the current.
      (4)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding.
   “FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).” A map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards
and the regulatory floodway.
   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).” A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency

preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   “FLOODPROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, the FEMA form in effect at the time of certification
stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation with walls
that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all structural
components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces,
including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact forces.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.
Also referred to as the “REGULATORY FLOODWAY”.
   “FLOODWAY FRINGE.” That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. “FREEBOARD” must be applied
not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also
to the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in §§
152.55  through
152.61 , means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50)
to one hundred (100) years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed
below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased
risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the
community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and
suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future
owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood
damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.” A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or

shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “GOVERNING BODY.” The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality
that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.” The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
miss-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification
of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).” Increased cost of compliance coverage
means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a
substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and
that is required to bring a substantially damaged building into compliance with
the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
flood proofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any
combination thereof. ICC coverage is available on residential and non-
residential buildings (this category includes public or government buildings,
such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   “LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. “LOMCs” include the following
categories:
      (1)   “LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).” A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was inadvertently included in a designated SFHA. A
LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property
is not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).” A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F).” A determination
that a structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill
above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   “LEVEE.” A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   “LEVEE SYSTEM.” A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   “LIMITED STORAGE.” An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   “LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The lowest elevation of the sidewalk, patio,
attached garage, deck support, basement entryway or grade immediately next to
the structure and after the completion of construction.
   “LOWEST FLOOR.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure’s lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   “MANUFACTURED HOME.” A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or
without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required
utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar
transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred and eighty (180)
consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. The term
“MANUFACTURED HOME” does not include a recreational vehicle (see “RECREATIONAL
VEHICLE”).

(FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   “MAP PANEL NUMBER.” The four (4) digit number on a flood map, followed by a
letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four (4) digits represent the map
panel. The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first
revision.)
   “MARKET VALUE.” The property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and
seller), excluding the value of the land as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. “MARKET VALUE” of the structure can be established by
independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of
structure (actual cash value) or adjusted assessed values.
   “MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).” The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on the community's FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988.
   “MITIGATION.” Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
costs of disaster response and recovery.
   “MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW).” Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a
dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water
on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
“MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW)” may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   “MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT.” The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   “MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA.” An area with land surfaces and slopes
of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   “NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP).” The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   “NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD).” As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRMs. Refer to
FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   “NEW CONSTRUCTION.” Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by
a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   “NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   “NON-RESIDENTIAL.” Structures that are not designed for human habitation,
including but is not limited to: small business concerns, churches, schools,
farm structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses,
recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial
structures, warehouses, and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less
than six (6) months duration.
   “NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD).” As corrected in 1988, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRMs and Digitally Referenced FIRMs
(DFIRMs). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM panel legend for correct datum.)
   “OBSTRUCTION.” Includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment,

other improvement of a structure, taking place during a one (1) year period in
which the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction”
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
“substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code Enforcement Official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

         (a)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
         (b)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and
floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

§ 152.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
152.07 , the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall
be provided in accordance with standards of §
152.41 (C).
      (1)   In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified
in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest
adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than one (1) foot
above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative
Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the
technical requirements for a state floodplain permit. The applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby base
flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross
sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with §
152.41 (A) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be flood proofed to an elevation one (1) foot above the level of
the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification along with the
design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in §
152.41 (D).
      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an
elevation one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this
requirement must meet or exceed the standards of §
152.41 (C).
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring.
         (a)   Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels;
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood.
         (b)   All such manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1) foot
above the level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   (a)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial
damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated
so that:
         (b)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
so that either the:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation; or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred and eighty (180)
consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured
homes”.
         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
152.07 , are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If §
152.41 (E) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and
other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
152.40  through
152.46 .

   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.07 , where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
152.07 .

§ 152.43 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.07 , are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be

   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one (1) foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
152.41 (B).

APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 152.55 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.

§ 152.59 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
chapter, the Variance and Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
   (A)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood hazard.
“MINIMUM NECESSARY” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under “public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
   (D)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
   (E)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) upon request.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of §
152.58  are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.

§ 152.60 VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.
   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that:
   (A)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage;
   (B)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Bracken County Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.

   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” (see definition) upon determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.

fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or imprisoned for not more
than ten (10) days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses
involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain
Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent
or remedy any violation.

establishment of such a Board of a joint Board, shall be deemed to be under the
jurisdiction of the Board appointed by the County Judge. Jurisdiction over any
city territory shall later pass to the Board of Adjustment of the city, if such

   (C)   Filing and processing complaints.
      (1)   Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of this chapter
may, within one hundred eighty (180) days of the alleged violation, or within
one (1) year if the alleged violation pertains to housing, file a written
complaint under oath with the City Administrator, containing the following
information:
         (a)   The name and address (if known) of the alleged violator
("respondent"), or facts sufficient to identify that person;
         (b)   An outline of the material facts upon which the complaint is
based;
         (c)   The alleged violation;

Kentucky Commission on Human Rights for further processing, investigation and/
or administrative proceedings in accordance with the Kentucky Civil Rights Act,

wherein the alleged violation is eliminated and the complainant is made whole
to the greatest extent practicable.
      (3)   If a settlement is achieved, the City Administrator shall furnish a
copy of a signed conciliation agreement to the complainant and the respondent.
The terms of the conciliation agreement may be made public, but no other
information relating to any complaint, its investigation or its disposition may
be disclosed without consent of the complainant and the person charged. A
conciliation agreement need not contain a declaration or finding that a
violation has in fact occurred, and it may provide for dismissal of the
complaint without prejudice. The City Council shall have discretion to approve,
modify, or reject the conciliation agreement.
      (4)   If conciliation is not achieved either by agreement between the
parties or approval by the City Council, the City Administrator shall proceed

      (6)   Upon approval by the City Council, the City Administrator shall
mail a copy of the order to the complainant and respondent, postage pre-paid.
The respondent shall have thirty (30) days to pay any penalty issued in the
order. If the respondent does not pay the penalty within the time given, then

respondent's property in the office of the County Clerk where the property is
