and dependent upon the unconstitutional part that it is apparent that Council
would not have enacted the remaining parts without the unconstitutional part,

being executed in accordance with the intent of Council.

enactment of a repealer of the ordinance that repealed it at the same or any
subsequent meeting of Council as long as it takes effect prior to the effective
date of the original repealer.
   (C)   An amended ordinance without a delayed effective date remains
unchanged with respect to an amendment which is repealed at the same meeting of
Council which enacted the amendment.
   (D)   An amended ordinance with a delayed effective date remains unchanged
with respect to that amendment if the ordinance making the amendment is
repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of Council as long as the
repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the original
amendment.
   (E)   No other action of Council repealing a repealer or an amendment shall
have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or amendment
as the case may be.
(KRS 446.100)
§ 10.09 RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES ACCRUING BEFORE REPEAL OF ORDINANCE.
   No new ordinance shall be construed to repeal a former ordinance as to any
offense committed against a former ordinance, nor as to any act done, or
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred, or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance
takes effect, except that the proceedings thereafter had shall conform, so far
as practicable, to the laws in force at the time of such proceedings. If any
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment is mitigated by any provision of the new
ordinance, such provision may, by the consent of the party affected, be applied
to any judgment pronounced after the new ordinance takes effect.
(KRS 446.110)
§ 10.10 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.
   (C)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,
the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter be
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   This code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the

pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
shall remain in full force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by
necessary implication.
§ 10.13 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
Council, or a certain city officer or employee, to make additional ordinances

prior to the codification and not inconsistent thereto, shall remain in effect

passage date, the conflict shall be so construed as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.

adopted by the favorable votes of at least a majority of the members of the

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 36.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A) As defined in §
36.01, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
36.12, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a request or complete a written application for such records at the
office of the City Clerk during regular office hours, except during legal
holidays. The written application shall be hand delivered, mailed, or sent via
facsimile, or sent via e-mail to the City Clerk’s office of public records or
his or her designee at the e-mail address designated to the City Clerk’s rules
and regulations. The City Clerk shall not require the use of any particular
form for the submission of an open records request, but shall accept for any
request the standardized form developed under state law. (KRS 61.872 (2))
   (B) If the custodian determines that a resident of the Commonwealth’s
request is in compliance with the open records law and the requested records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection. Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the
City Clerk for the inspection. No resident of the Commonwealth shall remove
original copies of public records from the offices of any public agency without
the written permission of the official custodian of the record. (See also KRS
61.872(1))
   (C) A resident of the Commonwealth may inspect public records during the
regular business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public
records from the city through the mail if the applicant's residence or
principal place of business is outside of the county in which the city is
located and he has precisely described public records which are available
within the city. If the resident of the Commonwealth requesting the public
records requests that the records be mailed, the official custodian shall mail
the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of mailing. (KRS 61.872(3))
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in § 36.01. (KRS 61.874
(1))
   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(2)(b))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874 (4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874 (5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).
(KRS 61.874(6))
§ 36.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk does not have custody or control of the public record or
records requested, the City Clerk shall so notify the applicant and shall
furnish the name and location of the custodian of the public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 36.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed five days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from
receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is given
for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the public
record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 36.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence. (KRS 61.872(6))
§ 36.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian's authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
(KRS 61.880)
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action. (KRS
61.880, 61.882)
§ 36.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.
   No official or employee of the city shall willfully conceal or destroy any
record with the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these rules
and regulations.
§ 36.11 ACCESS TO RECORDS RELATING TO PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.

      (3)   (a) Upon and after July 15, 1992, records confidentially disclosed

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under
this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a
decision is made to take no action. The exemptions provided by this subdivision
shall not be used by the custodian of the records to delay or impede the
exercise of rights granted by this chapter.

TRAFFIC SAFETY POLICY
§ 70.30 DEFINITIONS.
   As used herein, the following words and phrases have the meanings indicated
therefor:
   "ANYBODY, EVERYBODY and NOBODY."   Any, every and no human being, or any
organization or combination thereof, in the form of a corporation, partnership,
joint venture, unincorporated association or otherwise.
   "MOTOR VEHICLE."   Any wheeled vehicle propelled by any means other than
gravity or muscular power.
(Ord. 2001-08-10, passed 9-10-01)
§ 70.31 TRAFFIC SAFETY POLICY.
   The city is committed to a procedure of progressive steps that are designed
to reasonably insure the safety of citizens while on public right-of-ways.
These steps are intended to supplement the good personal safety habits of
citizens and to insure the consistent and equal response to traffic safety
issues throughout the city.
   (A)   Phase One.   The first step when a complaint is received is that it be
recorded and then investigated by the police. The method of investigation
should be up to the police; either a radar car or the unmanned radar trailer
would be used.
   (B)   Phase Two.   Based on the data collected in Phase One the next step,
assuming a problem does exist, would be toe establish a neighborhood meeting
conducted by the Police Department. The intent is to provide a source of
traffic safety education and to gather consensus on dealing with the problem.
The consensus solution should then be implemented. Results should be reported
back to the group and City Council.
      (1)   Traffic Signs.   The City Administrator, upon the recommendation of
the Police Chief, may request the installation of no parking or stop signs as
temporary relief to a particular traffic problem. The City Administrator shall
notify the City Council of such installation in the next monthly
administrator's report following such installation. The appropriate ordinances
shall be submitted to City Council at the first meeting of December each year
for the purpose of adding these locations to the respective permanent sign
authorization ordinances.
   (C)   Phase Three.   The third and final phase of response would be the use
of extraordinary measures such as directional regulation, closing a street, a
traffic light or the installation of speed humps or traffic control signs.
Speed bumps are not an acceptable option. The following general criteria must
be met before implementation of Phase Three control measures could even be
considered. The required criteria must be met before the staff would forward
any such request to City Council for their consideration.
      (1)   One Way or Dead End Streets.   A petition from ninety percent (90%)
of the residents living on an impacted street would be required before City
Council would consider making a street one way or closing one end to make it a
dead end street. Such a petition would only be considered if the city engineer
had been able to identify a significant benefit that would result from such
action and this benefit would help to solve the problem at hand without
creating other significant problems.
      (2)   Speed Humps.   Speed humps will only be used on collector streets.
They must be at least five hundred twenty-eight (528) feet apart. They can only
be installed if seventy-five percent (75%) of the residents located within one
quarter (¼) of a mile one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet of the
proposed site of the hump agree. The distance would be calculated to include
any contiguous right of way within the required distance.
      (3)   Traffic Signal.   The standard state "traffic warrants" must be met
before a traffic signal will be considered.

of §§ 70.30-70.33 shall be a misdemeanor, for which everybody convicted
thereof, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be sentenced to pay a
criminal fine, not to exceed the maximum amount of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) as set forth in
KRS 534.040(2).

notice from the City Administrative Officer, within thirty (30) days after an
application for a business regulatory license required by this subchapter has
been referred to the City Administrative Officer for review pursuant to
division (C) of this section, that the application was either conditionally
approved or disapproved, the City Clerk, or any designee thereof shall issue
the business regulatory license that is the subject of the application and mail
it to the applicant at the address listed in the application; and, thereafter,
the applicant may engage in the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or

BUSINESS OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE FEE
§ 110.30 LEVY; IMPOSITION.
   For the purpose of providing funds for the general operating expenses of the
city and the municipal services and functions provided thereby, and subject to
the provisions of KRS 67.750 through 67.795, an occupational license fee is
hereby levied and imposed upon everybody engaged in any franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business in the city, for the privilege of that
engagement.
(Ord. 2007-11-06, passed 12-10-07) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.31 RATE.
   (A)   The occupational license fee that is levied and imposed by this
subchapter is at the rate of:
      (1)   Employees. One percent (1%) of all of the gross compensation earned
by an employee for labor, work or services provided in the city.
      (2)   Those not an employee. Three-fourths of one percent (0.75%) of the
net profits of everybody, other than an employee, who is engaged in any
franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business in the city; but no
less than fifty dollars ($50.00); provided, however, that the Mayor or City
Administrative Officer may waive the fifty dollar ($50.00) minimum in the event
of either:
         (a)   The total gross receipts from activities in the city during the
tax period are less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00); and
         (b)   Within thirty (30) days after the close of the tax year of the
taxpayer, the city receives a written request for a refund of the balance of
the fifty dollar ($50.00) minimum that has been paid after deducting the tax
that is due based on a rate of three-fourths of one percent (0.75%) of the net
profits generated in the city.
   (B)   There is hereby reserved to the Mayor or the City Administrative
Officer the right to deny any request for a waiver of the fifty dollar ($50.00)
minimum that is incomplete or fails to follow the process for that waiver
described in this section.
(Ord. 2007-11-06, passed 12-10-07)
§ 110.32 APPORTIONMENT OF NET PROFITS.
   Pursuant to the authority of KRS 67.753(4), it is hereby determined that the
apportionment provisions of KRS 67.753 do not fairly represent the extent of
the engagement in the city of those, other than an employee, who are engaged in
any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business both within and
outside of the city; and, accordingly, the following described property factor
is hereby added to the payroll factor and the sales factor provided in KRS
67.753 for the apportionment of the net profits of those, other than an
employee, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business both within and outside of the city.
   (A)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
average value of the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal property owned or
rented and used in the city during the computation period, and the denominator
of which is the average value of all of the taxpayer’s real and tangible
personal property owned or rented and used anywhere during the computation
period. In the determination of the property factor:
      (1)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.
Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight (8) times the net annual
rental rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any
annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub- rentals.
      (2)   The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the
values at the beginning and ending of the computation period, but the City
Administrative Officer may require the averaging of monthly values during the
computation period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value
of the taxpayer’s property.
   (B)   The proportion of the total net profits everywhere of those, other
than an employee, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business both within and outside of the city that are
subject to the occupational license fee established by this subchapter, shall
be determined by multiplying the total net profits thereof everywhere by the
quotient of the total of the payroll factor and the sales factor described in
KRS 67.753(2) and (3), and the property factor described in division (A) above,
that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the
city during the tax period, divided by the total number of those factors that
the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the city
during the tax period. The total number of those factors that the franchise,
trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the city during the tax
period will always be either one (1), two (2) or three (3). For example, if the
franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business:
      (1)   Had only the sales revenue factor in the city, during the tax
period, without either the property factor or the payroll factor in the city,
the total number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business had in the city during the tax period would be one
(1);
      (2)   Had both the sales revenue factor and the payroll factor in the
city, during the tax period, without the property tax factor in the city, the
total number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession
or other business had in the city during the tax period would be two (2); or
      (3)   Had the sales revenue factor, and the payroll factor, and the
property factor in the city, during the tax period, the total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the city during the tax period would be three (3).
(Ord. 2007-11-06, passed 12-10-07)
§ 110.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Civil penalty. Each separate violation of this chapter is hereby
classified as a civil offense, for which:
      (1)   The maximum civil fine required by KRS 65.8808(2)(b) that may be
imposed for each separate violation of this chapter, is hereby established as
five hundred dollars ($500.00);
      (2)   The specific civil fine required by KRS 65.8802(2)(c) that will be
imposed for each separate offense and violation of this chapter if the person
who has committed the violation and offense does not contest a citation
therefor, is hereby established as one hundred dollars ($100.00); and
      (3)   An enforcement officer may, in lieu of immediately issuing a civil
citation, give notice that the violation of this chapter shall be remedied
within a specified period of time.
   (B)   Criminal penalty. Each violation of this chapter shall be a
misdemeanor for which everybody convicted thereof in a court of competent
