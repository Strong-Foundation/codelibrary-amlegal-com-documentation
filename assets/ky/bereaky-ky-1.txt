correct spelling of the word or words, or adding the omitted word or words, or
deleting the word or words found to be in error to conform with the original

or extent of the error.

word-for-word from the statutes. Example: (KRS 446.010). If a cite from the
Kentucky Revised Statutes is set forth as a "statutory reference" following the
text of the section, this indicates that additional information may be found

section refer to another section of the code where additional information about
a particular subject may be found.
   (F)   Where additional information of some nature is required or provided
that cannot otherwise be explained or corrected, or when a question of

or other provisions of this code printed in italicized type, bold type, or

the sections, unless so provided by the ordinance from which the sections were
derived.

   All references to chapters, articles, divisions, subchapters, or sections
contained within the provisions of this code are to the chapters, articles,
divisions, subchapters, or sections of this code, unless otherwise specified.

made for the offense and where the offense does not create a substantial harm
or threat of harm to lives or property, nor is the offense particularly

ARTICLE III. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN
§ 23.020 POLICY
   (A)   The affirmative action policy of the city is to promote equal
employment opportunity; to prohibit discrimination in city employment on
account of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age or disability not
related to performance of the job; and to bring about a fair representation and
utilization of females and minorities on all levels of city employment.
   (B)   The city will advise all employees and applicants for employment of
this policy, will make known to the public that employment opportunities are
available on the basis of individual ability, and will encourage all persons
who are employed by the city to strive for advancement on that basis.
(Res., 6-28-88)
§ 23.021 PERSONNEL ACTIONS
   The city will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are
recruited and employed, and that employees are treated during their employment,
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or
disability not related to ability to perform the job; and that affirmative
action shall include all terms and conditions of employment such as: hiring,
placement, upgrading, demotion, transfer, layoff and termination. (Res., 6-28-
88)
§ 23.022 WORKFORCE ANALYSIS
   (A)   The city has determined that the labor market in which it operates is
Madison County, Kentucky. The latest reliable data that shows the utilization
of females and minorities by job category is the 1980 general census.
   (B)   The number of women and minorities employed by the city in each job
category was compared with those available in the workforce of the community.
The percentage of such employees in the community was multiplied by the total
city employees in each job category to determine the number required for fair
selection.
   (C)   The city examined each category in which the number of females and
minorities were fewer than the number required for fair selection. Appropriate
goals for women and for minorities were established to bring the city's
utilization to a level comparable to the community workforce. Timetables were
based on the anticipated annual job openings in each category. Where a
disparity exists between the percentage of a protected group in the community
population and the percentage in the community workforce, the goals are
adjusted to overcome this disparity. The goal of fair utilization of minorities
and females in each category is to be met within the next five (5) years
through the personnel policies established by this plan without discrimination
of any kind. The maintenance of this policy will be a continuing effort.
(Res., 6-28-88)
§ 23.023 IMPLEMENTATION
   It is understood that implementation of this policy is an on-going process
which will make the plan a viable, effective document:
   (A)   Responsibility. The city administrator/coordinator shall be
responsible for implementation of the plan and shall have authority to require
department heads to furnish information necessary to keep current forms and
reports.
   (B)   Duties. The administrator/coordinator shall disseminate the city's
equal employment opportunity policy as set forth in the affirmative action
plan; maintain current job classifications and minimum requirements based on
the tasks to be performed by each position, an updated workforce analysis, an
applicant flow chart and job roster; and prepare a consolidated report for the
entire city government.
   (C)   Reports. The administrator/coordinator shall monitor the operation of
this plan and shall prepare a consolidated annual progress report together with
indications of problem areas and recommendations for solutions for the city
council.
(Res., 6-28-88)
§ 23.024 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
   Any employee who believes he has been adversely affected by an act or
decision of the supervisory or managerial personnel of the city and that the
act or decision was based on race, color, sex, religion, national origin or
disability shall have the right to process a complaint or grievance in
accordance with the following procedures:
   (A)   An employee who has a grievance regarding his employment by the city
may discuss the grievance with his supervisor.

grievance does not satisfy the employee, he may discuss it with the

employee, he may request a hearing. The decision of the council regarding the
grievance shall be final.
   (D)   In thus discussing the grievance, the employee may designate any
person of his choice to appear with him and participate in the discussion. The
council may require the supervisor to participate in the discussion of the
grievance when it is brought before the council.
   (E)   Any prospective employee or applicant for employment who is denied
employment with the city and believes that denial was based in whole or in part
on the race, religion, sex, age or physical condition of the applicant may file
a written complaint with the administrator/coordinator who shall make every
effort to resolve the matter impartially and expeditiously. The appeal
procedure above is also available to the grievant.

(5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and city-recognized holidays, whether
to comply with the request and shall notify in writing the person making the

official custodian denies the request, in whole or in part, inspection of any
record shall include a statement of the specific exception authorizing the
withholding of the record and a brief explanation of how the exception applies
to the record withheld. The response shall be issued by the official custodian
or the city’s legal counsel, and it shall constitute final agency action.

§ 27.002 FINDINGS; PURPOSE; AUTHORITY
   (A)   Findings. The legislative body of the city finds and declares that:
      (1)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
      (2)   The vitality and stability of the government of this city depends
upon the public's confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed
officers and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the
private interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that
confidence is imperiled.
      (3)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
the standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
   (B)   Purpose.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring
that standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for
officers and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in
their application, and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees
of the city with advice and information concerning potential conflict of
interest which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
      (2)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements
of KRS 65.003 as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   Authority. This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city
by KRS 82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

(Ord. No. 19-94, 12-6-94; Am. Ord. No. 02-20, 2-18-20)

whole or in part, any contract made, entered into, awarded or granted by the
city or a city agency, except as follows:
      (1)   The prohibition in subsection (A) of this section shall not apply
to contracts entered into before an elected officer filed as a candidate for
city office, before an appointed officer was appointed to a city or city agency
office, or before an employee was hired by the city or a city agency; provided
that any contract entered into by a city or city agency officer or an employee
before he or she became a candidate, was appointed to office, or was hired as

to contracts entered into before an elected officer filed as a candidate for

office, or before an employee was hired by the city or a city agency. However,
if any contract entered into by a city or city agency officer or employee
before he became a candidate, was appointed to office, or was hired as an

the officer or employee is authorized to participate in establishing the
contract specifications, awarding the contract, or managing contract

of the authorities set forth in the preceding sentence, then the officer or
employee shall have no interest in the contract, unless the requirements set

in any case where the following requirements are satisfied:

governing body of the city or city agency before the contract is executed.
         (c)   A finding is made by the governing body of the city or city
agency that the contract with the officer or employee is in the best interests
of the public and the city or city agency because of price, limited supply, or
other specific reasons, before the contract is executed.
         (d)   The finding is made a part of the official record of the

§ 27.012   MISUSE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
      No officer or employee of the city or any city agency shall intentionally
use or disclose information acquired in the course of his or her official
duties, if the primary purpose of the use or disclosure is to further his or
her personal financial interest or that of another person or business.

pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act, KRS 61.872 to 61.884, at the time of
its use or disclosure.
(Ord. No. 19-94, 12-6-94; Am. Ord. No. 02-20, 2-18-20)
§ 27.013   WITHDRAWAL FROM PARTICIPATION
   (A)   An officer or employee must refrain from acting on or discussing,
formally or informally, a matter before the city, if acting on the matter, or
failing to act on the matter, may personally or financially benefit any of the
persons or entities listed in §
27.010(C). Such an officer or employee should join the public if the withdrawal
occurs at a public meeting, or leave the room if it is a legally conducted
closed meeting (executive sessions) under KRS 61.810 or 61.815.
   (B)   Withdrawal at a meeting requires the public announcement, on the
record, of the reason for the withdrawal.
   (C)   Ongoing conflict. An officer or employee whose outside employment or
other outside activity or relationship can be reasonably expected to require
more than a sporadic withdrawal must resign or cease such outside employment or
activity. An officer or employee should not begin employment or an activity or
relationship that can reasonably be expected to require more than sporadic
withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is in such a situation he or
she should not accept the position with the city.
   (D)   Request to withdraw. If an officer or appointed board member is
requested to withdraw from participation in a matter, for the reason that he or
she has a conflict of interest, by:
      (1)   Another member;
      (2)   A party to the current matter; or
      (3)   Anyone else who may be affected by a decision relating to this
matter;
The member must decide whether to withdraw on the official record. If the
member decides not to withdraw, the unchallenged members must consider any
relevant evidence concerning such claimed conflict of interest, as defined in
this chapter, and vote whether or not to allow the request and require the
member to withdraw from participating in such matter.
   (E)   If withdrawal by the member would leave the body with less than a
quorum capable of acting, the member must disclose the conflict on the public
record, then the remaining members may vote to allow the member with the
disclosed conflict to vote. If the person is the only one authorized by law to
act, the person must disclose the nature and circumstances of the conflict to
the board of ethics and request a waiver or advisory opinion.
(Ord. No. 02-20, 2-18-20)
§ 27.014   RECEIPT OF GIFTS
   No officer, employee, or appointee of the city shall, directly or
indirectly, solicit any gift or accept or receive any gift having a value of
seventy-five dollars ($75.00) or more, whether in the form of money, service,
loan, travel, entertainment, hospitality, thing or promise or any other form,
under circumstances in which it could be reasonably inferred that the gift was
intended to influence, or could reasonably be expected to influence, the
officer, employee, or appointee in the performance of his or her official
duties, or was intended as a reward for any official action. This prohibition
shall not include any gift accepted on behalf of the city and transferred to
the city.
(Ord. No. 02-20, 2-18-20)
§ 27.015   USE OF CITY PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL

extent and upon the terms that such use is available to the general public.

§ 31.330 PERMITS
   (A)   There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits required; (1)
for residential and (2) for service to commercial and industrial
establishments. In either case, the owner(s) or his agent shall make
application on a special form furnished by the city. Applicants for a service
to commercial and industrial establishments shall be required to furnish
information about all waste producing activities, wastewater characteristics
and constituents. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of
the superintendent. Details regarding commercial and industrial permits
include, but are not limited to those required by this chapter. Permit and
inspection fees shall be paid to the city at the time the application is
filed.  
   (B)   Users shall promptly notify the city in advance of any introduction of
wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character of
the wastewater constituents being introduced into the POTW. The superintendent
may deny or condition the new introduction or change in discharge based on the
information submitted in the notification or additional information as may be
requested.
   (C)   No person(s) shall uncover, plug or make any connection with or
opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining permission from the superintendent.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.331 PROHIBITED CONNECTIONS
   (A)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement wall
seepage or floor seepage, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other
surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in
turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. Any such
connections which already exist on the effective date of this chapter shall be
completely and permanently disconnected within sixty (60) days of the effective
date of this chapter. The owner(s) of any building sewers having such
connections, leaks or defects shall bear all costs incidental to removal of
such sources. Pipes, sumps, and pumps for such sources of ground and surface
water shall be separate for wastewater facilities. Removal of such sources of
water without presence of separate facilities shall be evidence of drainage to
public sanitary sewer.
   (B)   Floor, basement, or crawl space drains which are lower than ground
surfaces surrounding the building shall not be connected to the building
sanitary sewer. No sanitary inlet which is lower than six (6) inches above the
top of the lowest of the two (2) adjacent public sanitary sewer manholes shall
be connected by direct drainage to the building sanitary sewer. Building
sanitary sewer connections in structures not meeting the criteria of this
section will be permitted only if the property owner has:
      (1)   Installed an individual pumping facility at the structure to
receive the building sewage. The pumping facility shall include a discharge
pipe with a high point which meets the criteria above; or,
      (2)   Installed a sewer backflow stop or flap of such nature and design
to provide gravity flow to the sanitary sewer system and to prevent sewage
backflow into the property improvement.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.332 DESIGN AND INSTALLATIONS
   (A)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway. The sewer
from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any
obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such
single connection aforementioned.
   (B)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the superintendent, to meet all
requirements of this chapter. Permit and inspection fees for new buildings
using existing building sewers shall be the same as for new building sewers. If
additional sewer customers are added to the old building sewers, additional
sewer tap fees shall be charged accordingly even though no new sewer tap is
actually made into the city system.
   (C)   Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customer's
side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than that of the
customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be permitted.
   (D)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM A-74, latest
revision, PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) sewer pipe, ASTM D-3034, latest revision,
unglazed clay sewer pipe, ASTM C-261, latest revision, vitrified clay sewer
pipe, ASTM C-700, latest revision, or ductile iron pipe, AWWA specification C-
151 cement-lined, and shall meet requirements of state plumbing code. Joints
shall be as set out hereinafter. Any part of the building sewer that is located
within five (5) feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed with cast
iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe, unless the building sewer is at least one
foot deeper in the ground than the water service line. In the latter case,
vitrified clay pipe may be used. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe may
be required by the city where the building sewer is exposed to damage or
stoppage by tree roots. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe shall be used
in filled or unstable ground, in areas where the cover over the building sewer
is less than three (3) feet, or in areas where the sewer is subject to
vehicular or other external loads.
   (E)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the local and state building and plumbing codes and other applicable rules and
regulations of the city.
   (F)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall
indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. Fees for connection shall
be as established by the city.
   (G)   The owner shall ensure that all excavations for building sewer
installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the city.
   (H)   In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the same building sewer.
Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary drainage shall be above
basement floor or in separately watertight or drained sump or channel.
   (I)   The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the
easement or property line. Where no property located service branch is
available, an authorized agent of the city shall cut a neat hole into the main
line of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle shall be installed to
receive the building sewer. The invert of the building sewer at such point of
connection with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant to the main line of the
public sewer. A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner
surface of the public sewer, shall be made and the saddle made secure and
watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A
wye and H bend fitting shall be installed at the property line between the
public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a
cleanout and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After
testing, a cast iron or ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and
brought flush with the ground surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type
joint applicable to the pipe used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion
of ground or surface water.
   (J)   All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet or
exceed the most current revision of the state plumbing code.
   (K)   All persons working on city sewers with a cleaning rod must use an
approved type rod in cleaning sewer connections to city sewers.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.333 INSPECTION
   (A)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
superintendent when the building sewer is ready for connection to the public
sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the superintendent
or his representative. The connections shall be made gastight and watertight
and verified by proper testing.
   (B)   All building sewers shall be smoke tested through the wye branch at
the public sewer connection, with public sewer tightly plugged off, after
connections at both ends are made and after all pipe is properly bedded and
backfilled at least to top of pipe and if backfill is completed, within two
weeks after completion of backfill. At time of test, any openings into the
building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any
leakage of smoke from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be
located at test and repaired to stand repetitions of smoke test without
leakage. When smoke testing is completed, the temporary flow line plug shall be
removed and a permanent water tight plug shall be placed in branch of test wye-
branch and carefully backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six (6) inches
above the top of the branch.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.334 DUTY OF ARCHITECTS, CONTRACTORS
   All architects, contractors, builders, or other persons who shall hereafter
erect new buildings for dwelling, manufacturing or commercial purposes, on a
lot or parcel of ground abutting on a street, alley or easement in the city in
which there has been installed or may be installed and maintained any sewer
line shall, before erecting any building, exhibit to the city council, or any
other board or body of the city which may be in charge and control of the
municipal sewer system, satisfactory evidence that a means has been or will be
provided for connecting the sanitary sewerage drain pipes from the building
with the sewer line.

§ 31.364 ALTERNATE DISCHARGE LIMITS
   (A)   Where an effluent from a categorical industrial process(es) is mixed
prior to treatment with wastewater other than that generated by the regulated
process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge
permit by the superintendent. These alternative limits shall be applied to the
mixed effluent and shall be calculated using the combined wastestream formula
and/or flow-weighted average formula as defined in Division I.
   (B)   Where the effluent limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production
(production-based standard), the superintendent may convert the limits to
equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day
or of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent permit
limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be subject to all
permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully
comply with these alternative limits.
   (C)   All categorical users subject to production-based standards must
report production rates annually so that alternative permit limits can be
calculated if necessary. The categorical user must notify the superintendent
thirty (30) days in advance of any major change in production levels that will
affect the limits for the discharge permit.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.365 PERMIT DURATION

of any proposed changes in their permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the
effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall
include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.366 PERMIT TRANSFER
   Industrial user permits are issued to a specific user for a specific
operation. An industrial user permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or
sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or change operation
without a thirty (30) day prior notification to the superintendent and
provision of a copy of the existing permit to the new owner. The superintendent
may deny the transfer of the permit if it is deemed necessary.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.367 COMPLIANCE DATE REPORTING
   (A)   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new user,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to federal categorical pretreatment standards and requirements
shall submit, to the Operations Manager, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process
which are limited by categorical pretreatment standards and requirements and
the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's
facility which are limited by such categorical pretreatment standards or
requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional pretreatment and time schedule is necessary to bring
the user into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the user.
   (B)   Where compliance schedules are required, the following conditions
shall apply:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Operations Manager
no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91; Am. Ord. No. 01-13, § 7, 2-5-13)
§ 31.368 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS
   (A)   All significant industrial users shall submit, to the Operations
Manager, every six (6) months (on dates specified in the industrial user
permit), unless required more frequently by the permit, a report indicating, at
a minimum, the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by such pretreatment standards or the discharge permit. The report
shall also include the chain-of-custody (COC) forms, field data and any other
information required by the Operations Manager. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded
the average daily flow. At the discretion of the Operations Manager and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, etc., the Operations Manager may agree to alter the months during which
the reports are to be submitted. All periodic compliance reports must be signed
and certified in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12 and § 31.376.
   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge. All analyses shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to
the city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures
established by the U.S. EPA Administrator pursuant to § 304(g) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto and 40 CFR 261 or with any
other test procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator. Sampling shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the U.S. EPA
Administrator. Except as indicated in divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this section,
the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the Operations Manager. Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Operations Manager,
the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the composting
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
Operations Manager, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required
to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
      (1)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (2)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four (4)
grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data
are available, the Operations Manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial user is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (C)   Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant(s) in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication.
“Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants,” April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
   (D)   A baseline monitoring report (BMR) must be submitted to the Operations
Manager by all categorical industrial users at least ninety (90) days prior to
initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. The BMR must contain, at a
minimum, the following:
      (1)   Production data: a process description, SIC code number, raw
materials used, chemicals used, final product, pretreatment industrial category
(if applicable), and a schematic which indicates points of discharge to the
sewer system.
      (2)   Identifying information to include name, address of facility, owner
(s), contact person and any other permits held by the facility.
      (3)   Wastewater characteristics: total plant flow, types of discharges,
average and maximum flows from each process.
      (4)   Nature/Concentration of pollutants: analytical results for all
pollutants regulated by this chapter and/or any applicable federal pretreatment
standard and sample type and location. All analyses must conform with 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto.
      (5)   Information concerning any pretreatment equipment used to treat the
facility’s discharge.
      (6)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user’s
authorized representative as defined in § 31.301 and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance
(O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment
standards and requirements.
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in § 31.300.
   (E)   New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in
subsections (3) and (4), but at no time shall a new source commence discharge
(s) to the public sewer of substances that do not meet the provisions of this
chapter. All new sources must be in compliance with all provisions of this
chapter, state and federal pretreatment regulations prior to commencement of
discharge to the public sewer.
   (F)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to all compliance schedules required by this chapter:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards.
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Operations Manager
no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and in
no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports
to the Operations Manager.
   (G)   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and
documentation associated with best management practices as may be required.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for
a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall automatically be
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city or
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention by the
Operations Manager.

   (A)   The city shall require significant users to provide and operate, at
the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling,
and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage system. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in a public right-of-way. The
superintendent shall review and approve the location, plans, and specifications
for the monitoring facilities and may require them to be constructed to provide
for the separate monitoring and sampling of industrial waste and sanitary
sewage flows. There shall be ample room in or near the sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility shall be designed and maintained at all times in a proper
operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public
or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided
in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local
construction standards and specification. Construction shall be completed
within ninety (90) days following approval of the location, plans and
specifications.
   (B)   All sampling analyses done in accordance with approved federal EPA
procedures by the industrial user during a reporting period shall be submitted
to the superintendent regardless of whether or not that analysis was required
by the industrial user's discharge permit.
   (C)   The industrial user must receive the approval of the superintendent
before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring facilities to be used in
all required sampling.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.371 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING
   (A)   The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether
the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city or their representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, copying records, records examination or in the performance of any of
their duties.
   (B)   The city, approval authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.372 PRETREATMENT
   All significant industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this chapter and achieve compliance with
any applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time
limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. The city may
require the development of a compliance schedule for installation of
pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any industrial user that cannot
meet discharge limits required by this chapter. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level required by this chapter shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city
for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the
facility. The review of the plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an effluent that complies with the provisions of this chapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall
be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of
the changes.

exceed limits specified herein for such pollutants and who are permitted to
make such wastewater contributions to the system by decision of the sewer
commission.
   (D)   Charges for debt service shall mean charges levied on users of the
sewage treatment system to support the annual debt service obligations of the
system.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.383 SEWER RATES
   (A)   The rates and charges for sewer service shall be based insofar as
possible upon the quantity of water supplied to the respective premises as the
same is measured by water meter(s) used by the utility companies supplying
water to sewer customers. There shall be charged monthly to the owner or
occupant of each and every lot, parcel of land, building or premises, within
the corporate limits, discharging sewage, water or other liquid wastes
connected with the municipal sewer system, the following rates for user charges
and rates for debt service charges based upon the water meter readings or
estimated water consumption as follows:
      (1)   Commodity charge:
         First 200 cubic feet (minimum bill)      $6.9000/monthly
         Over 200 cubic feet            $2.63/100 cubic feet
      (2)   Late payment charge: 10% will be added if bill is not paid by the
10th day after billing date.
      (3)   Reconnect charges: $20.00 for customers of Berea Water Utility;
$40.00 for customers of Southern Madison Water District.
      (4)   Discontinuance of service for non-payment: If the account is not
paid by the 20th day after the date of mailing of the monthly bill, service may
be discontinued in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Berea
Municipal Sewer Utility.
      (5)   Additional charges: There shall be added to the bill of each
customer as a separate item an amount equal to the proportionate part of any
license, franchise or similar fee or tax now or hereafter imposed upon the
Berea Municipal Sewer Utility by any governmental body or entity, including but
not limited to the Berea Independent School District or the Madison County
School District, or similar administrative or governmental body.
   (B)   A schedule of tapping fees or connection fees or charges for each
connection to the sanitary sewer system of the city is established. From and
after the effective date of this chapter, the schedule of tapping fees or
connection fees or charges shall be paid to the city within ninety (90) days
after notice is given by the city to the owner or occupant of any premises
where sanitary sewer service is made available by the city that the adjacent
sanitary sewer facility is capable of receiving sewage. The schedule of tapping
fees or connection fees or charges is as follows:
Tapping and Connection Charges:
Meter Size (Inches) Maximum Flow (GPM) Equivalent Factor Connection Fee ($)
Tapping and Connection Charges:
Meter Size (Inches) Maximum Flow (GPM) Equivalent Factor Connection Fee ($)
5/8                 20                 1.0               400
1                   50                 2.5               1,000
1-1/2               100                5.0               2,000
2                   160                8.0               3,200
3                   320                16.0              6,400
4                   500                25.0              10,000
 
   In the event a larger, or an additional meter is installed, additional
charges based on the foregoing shall be imposed and paid.
   (C)   An application shall be submitted for all new sewer line connections
or extensions, along with the proposed plans for construction, for approval by
the commission prior to commencement of the work thereon. The cost of
construction of all sewer service lines or extensions shall also be paid by the
customer applying for a new service line connection. Upon approval and
immediate payment of the sewer tapping and connection fee, the sewer commission
shall grant to the applicant a permit to tap or connect the service line to the
existing public sewage treatment system. All construction and improvements
shall be done according to the existing building codes or other applicable
building codes and shall be subject to inspection and approval by the city
prior to connecting to the public sewage treatment system. Sewer line
extensions and service line connections constructed in, along or upon public
streets, roads, alleys, or dedicated utility easements, after inspection,
approval, and acceptance by the commission, shall become a part of the public
sewer system of the city.
   (D)   Normal monthly billings for sewer service shall be determined on the
basis of each user's metered water consumption and rates provided by subsection
(A). It is recognized in the assessment of charges that not all metered water
consumption is returned to the sewers. For the purpose of assessing service
charges equitably, the average percentage of metered water consumption returned
to the sewer is deemed to be ninety (90%) percent. Where it can be evidenced
that the proportion of metered water consumption actually returned to the
treatment system by an individual customer is significantly different from
ninety (90%) percent, service charges shall be determined on the basis of
actual wastewater discharge. In this event, the volume of wastewater discharge
shall be determined by using additional water meters to segregate water
consumption that is returned to the sewers and/or actual consumption that is
returned to the sewers and/or actual metering of wastewater flows and/or any
other procedure determined by the user and the sewer commission as a reasonable
method of determining flows. The city reserves the right to require the
installation of additional water meters and/or wastewater flow meters for the
purpose of determining actual monthly wastewater flows.

§ 31.384 SURCHARGE RATE SCHEDULE
   (A)   A sewer user may be permitted to discharge wastes to the sewage works
having an average biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentration in excess of
250 milligrams per liter (mg/l), and/or an average suspended solids (SS)
concentration in excess of 250 mg/l, and/or an average ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N)
concentration in excess of 25 mg/l; and/or an average oil and grease, T(O&G)
concentration in excess of 100 mg/l. In the event the sewer commission shall
permit a user to discharge such wastes, the user shall pay a surcharge fee
based upon the excess strength of its wastes as set out in subsection (B)
below.
   (B)   The following surcharge rates shall apply monthly to each user of the
sewage works that has obtained a permit from the commission to contribute
excessive strength sewage.
 
Surcharge Rates
BOD (in excess of 250 mg/l)   $ .18 per pound
SS (in excess of 250 mg/l)    .18 per pound
NH3 -H (in excess of 25 mg/l) .71 per pound
O&G ( in excess of 100 mg/l)  .25 per pound
 
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.385 METHOD OF BILLING SURCHARGES
   (A)   (1)   The excessive strength surcharge shall be based on the following
formula, with the total to be applied to the monthly bill of the affected
users:
   [A (E-250) + B(F-250) + C(G-25) + D(H-100)] X .00624 X K = Surcharge Payment
($/Mo.)
      (2)   The formula components are as follows:
          A =   Surcharge rate for BOD, in $/pound.
          B =   Surcharge rate for SS, in $/pound.
          C =   Surcharge rate for NH3-N, in $/pound.
          D =   Surcharge rate for O&G, in $/pound.
          E =   User's average BOD concentration, in mg/l.
          F =   User's average SS concentration, in mg/l.
          G =   User's average NH 3-N concentration, in mg/l.
          H =   User's average O&G concentration, in mg/l.
          J =   User's monthly flow to sewage works, in 100 cubic ft.
   (B)   No reduction in sewage service charges, fees, or taxes shall be
permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the sewage
works contain less concentrations than those established as maximum in this
chapter.
   (C)   Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a
regular bill of the surcharge rate and that portion of the total charge which
is attributable to operations and maintenance of the sewage system.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.386 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
   (A)   The city, through its sewer commission, shall maintain financial
records to accurately account for revenues generated by the treatment system
and expenditures for operation and maintenance of the system, including normal
replacement costs.
   (B)   The city shall review not less often than annually the sewage
contribution of users, the total cost of operation and maintenance of the
sewage works, debt service obligations, and sewer service charges, Based on
such review, the city shall revise, when necessary, the schedule of sewer
service charges to accomplish the following:
      (1)   Maintain an adequate distribution of operations and maintenance
costs among users of the treatment system, and
      (2)   Generate sufficient revenues to offset costs associated with the
proper operation and maintenance of the sewage system and to meet debt service
requirements.
   (C)   Excessive strength surcharges shall be reviewed at the time of and in
conjunction with the review of sewer service charges. Surcharge rates shall be
revised where necessary to reflect current treatment and monitoring costs.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
§ 31.387 RATES OUTSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS
   For each owner or occupant of any lot, parcel of land, building, or premises
outside the corporate limits which discharges sewage, water, or other liquid
waste, into the municipal sewer system, the rate charge shall be two (2) times
the above rates; provided, however, that within one-half (1/2) mile of the
existing corporate limits, the regular monthly service rates for residential
customers and purposes only, including apartment buildings and duplexes in
which individual renters pay the sewer charges, shall not be double the city
rates, where the customer has installed and paid for all line installation
costs, and has conveyed ownership of the sewer lines, along with the easement
to the sewer commission. For all other purposes, including tap-on fees and all
other uses, all charges outside the city limits shall remain at two (2) times
the in-city rates.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91; Amd. Ord. 6-92, 3-31-92)
§ 31.388 METHOD OF BILLING
   (A)    The rates and charges established in this article shall be billed to
the owners or occupants of the premises. If the occupant of any of the premises
is not the owner, both the occupant and the owner shall be responsible for
payment of the sewer bills. Whenever a bill for the rates and charges
established in this article shall have been billed and remain unpaid for thirty
(30) days, the amount of said bill and any and all costs incurred by the sewer
commission in enforcing and collecting the bill shall constitute a lien against
the property to which the sewer service was provided. The superintendent of
sewers shall file a notice of the lien, and it shall be proven and collected as
provided by law. The lien shall be notice to all persons from the time of its
recording and shall bear interest at the legal rate thereafter until satisfied.
   (B)    The sewer service rates and charges shall be billed monthly and all
bills for the services shall be payable within ten (10) days after rendition.
If not paid within the ten-day period, the charges shall be deemed delinquent
and a penalty of ten (10) percent shall be added and collected as a part of the
bill. The city shall render the bills for sewer services and collect and
account for the bills in the manner as prescribed by law and the proceedings
pursuant to which the sewer revenue refunding and improvement bonds of the city
are to be issued.
   (C)    (1)   If a bill is not paid within twenty (20) days after rendition,
the city shall, as authorized by KRS 96.930 to 96.943, inclusive, issue to the
party supplying water services to the premises a direction to discontinue the
water service whether the water service bill has been paid or not.
      (2)   In the event the city shall issue such direction to the water
supplier, the delinquent sewer user shall become liable to the city for the
amount of twenty dollars ($20.00) for the fee of the water supplier and any
expenses incurred in effecting the discontinuance of water service.
   (D)    When the delinquent sewer user has paid the amount of the delinquent
bill in full, together with the prescribed penalty and the amount of the fee
and expenses incurred in discontinuance, the city will notify the water
supplier that the sewer bill delinquency no longer exists. The sewer user may
then, as far as the city is concerned, seek restoration of the discontinued
water service upon the terms and conditions as the water supplier may lawfully
prescribe.
   (E)   The attorney for the city is hereby authorized and directed to enforce
and collect any charges remaining delinquent for thirty (30) days.

1, passed 3-19-91)
§ 31.389 REVENUE STABILIZATION ADJUSTMENT
   A monthly adjustment, which may either be a charge or credit, shall be
applied for the purpose of providing for the difference between Berea's
budgeted cost of service and projected revenues for the current fiscal year.
Cost of service shall include operation and maintenance expenses, interest and
principal on debt, average extensions and replacements, and margins. The
adjustment shall be determined prior to the beginning of each fiscal year and
remain in effect for the entire fiscal year. The revenue stabilization
adjustment shall be applied as charge or credit per cubic foot or gallon,
whichever is applicable.

(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91)
Division 9. Enforcement
§ 31.395 GENERAL
   (A)   The city, through the superintendent or his designee, to insure
compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40 CFR Subchapter N, and
401 KAR 5:055, may take the following enforcement steps against users in non-
compliance with the chapter. The remedies available to the POTW include
injunctive relief, civil and criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of
discharges and/or water service and the publishing of the list of significant
violators annually. The enforcement authority shall be vested in the
superintendent or their designee.
   (B)   The superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or
an industrial user permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of
the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city
to violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES Permit.
   (C)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the industrial user permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall
reinstate the industrial user permit and/or the wastewater treatment service
upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed
written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be
submitted to the city within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence.
   (D)   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The
Operations Manager may take any, all, or combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the Operations
Manager may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further the Operations Manager is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. No. 17-91, 6-25-91; Am. Ord. No. 01-13, § 12, 2-5-13)
§ 31.396 ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS
   (A)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   Any user found to be violating any provisions of this chapter,
wastewater permit, or any order issued hereunder, shall be served by the city
with the written notice stating the nature of the violation(s). Within ten (10)
days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted to the superintendent. Submission
of this plan in no way relieves the user of potential liability for any
violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
      (2)   If the violations persist or the explanation and/or plan are not
adequate, the city's response shall be more formal and commitments (or
schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in an enforceable
document. The enforcement response selected will be related to the seriousness
of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if compliance is not
achieved expeditiously after the initial action. A significant non-compliance
as defined in §
31.374, will require a formal enforcement action.
      (3)   The full scale of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the
enforcement response plan.
   (B)   Administrative orders. Any user who after receiving a notice of

forthwith, or take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The superintendent or his designee may issue to any user who causes
or contributes to violations of this chapter, wastewater permit or order issued
hereunder, an order to appear and show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place of a hearing to be held by the superintendent regarding the
violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement
action, and directing the user to show cause, before the superintendent, why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt

be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will
be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon
payment of the usual charges thereof.
      (4)   After the city has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified
time period, the sewer service will be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly operated.
Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
   (D)   Additional enforcement remedies.
      (1)   Performance bonds. The superintendent may decline to reissue a
permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of

provisions of such permits. Proof of compliance with such permits may be
required in a form acceptable to the City of Berea.
(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14)
§ 34.107   RULES AND REGULATIONS
   (A)   Elimination of illicit discharges. Notwithstanding the requirements of
this section herein, the Enforcement Agency of the City of Berea may require by
written notice that a person responsible for an illicit discharge immediately,
or by a specified date, discontinues the discharge and, if necessary, take
measures to eliminate the source of the discharge to prevent the occurrence of
future illicit discharges.
   (B)   Monitoring of discharges. Upon written request to the person, the city
shall have safe and easy access to the areas to be inspected and/or monitored.
Temporary or permanent obstructions to safe and easy access to the site to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner at the written
or oral request of the Enforcement Agency of the City of Berea. The city shall
be provided access to all parts of the premises subject to this section for the
purposes of inspection, monitoring, sampling and for the performance of other
duties necessary to determine compliance with this section. The person
responsible for any violation of this chapter with regard to illicit discharges
shall be liable for expenses incurred by monitoring and analyses.
      (1)   The Enforcement Agency of the City of Berea has the right to
require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (2)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
   (C)   Remediation. Any person responsible for illicit discharges and who
fails to correct any prohibited condition or discontinue any prohibited
activity at the order of the city, shall be liable to the city for expenses
incurred in abating pollution. This may include expenses incurred in testing,
measuring, sampling, collecting, removing, treating, and disposing of the
polluting materials and preventing further noncompliance and/or illicit
discharges.
   (D)   Accidental discharges.
      (1)   If an emergency response by governmental agencies is needed, the
owner or operator should call 911 immediately to report the discharge. A
written report must be provided to the city within five (5) days of the time
the discharger becomes aware of the circumstances, unless this requirement is
waived by the city for good cause shown as determined by the city or its
designee on a case-by-case basis, containing the following information:
         (a)   A description of the discharge including volumes and
concentrations;
         (b)   The exact dates and times of discharge; and
         (c)   Steps being taken to eliminate and prevent recurrence of the
discharge.
      (2)   The discharger shall take all reasonable steps to minimize any
adverse impact to the MS4 or the Waters of the Commonwealth, including
accelerated or additional monitoring necessary to determine the nature and
impact of the discharge. It shall not be a defense, for the discharger in an
enforcement action, to claim that it would have been necessary to halt or
reduce the business or activity of the facility in order to maintain storm
water quality and minimize any adverse impact that the discharge may cause.
   (E)   Notification of spills, non-hazardous. In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Enforcement Agency for
the City of Berea in person, by phone, email, City of Berea's website, or
facsimile no later than 5:00 p.m. of the next business day. Notifications shall
be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the City of Berea within

§ 34.108   REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
   The Enforcement Agency of the City of Berea will adopt requirements
identifying Best Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility
which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the
storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial
or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14)
§ 34.109   WATERCOURSE PROTECTION
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, yard waste, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of
water through the watercourse. The city will assist property owners with the
maintenance of city adopted watercourses. In addition, the owner or lessee
shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.

§ 34.110   INSPECTION AND MONITORING
   (A)   Inspection. Whenever the Enforcement Agency of the City of Berea has
cause to believe that there exists, or potentially exists, any condition which
constitutes a violation of this section, the Enforcement Agency of the City of
Berea may enter the suspect property, MS4, community waters and waters of the
Commonwealth at all reasonable times to inspect the same. If it is determined
an illicit discharge emanates from private premises, the owner or operator of
the premises will be notified in accordance with the provisions of this
section. Copies of records of stormwater compliance shall be provided to the
Enforcement Agency of the City of Berea.
   (B)   Sampling devices and testing. During any inspection as provided
herein, the Enforcement Agency of the City of Berea may take any samples and
perform any testing deemed necessary, including long-term monitoring, to aid in
the pursuit of the inquiry or to record site activities. The cost of all
testing may be passed on to the owner or operator of the premises where the
illicit discharge emanates.

use of structural and nonstructural measures is not practicable, the permittee
shall submit written justification to the City of Berea for review and
approval.
(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14)
§ 34.206   PLAN REQUIREMENTS
   (A)   Erosion protection and sediment control for construction projects
requires continual planning, observation and action for all components of the
overall plan. The process will be documented through requirements established
by the Kentucky Division of Water, and implemented in their KYR10 permit While
stormwater management plans typically contain permanent treatment practices
(PTPs) instead of temporary practices, the initial plan submittal must address
permanent stormwater management including water quality. A general description
of each type of plan follows.
   (B)   Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan. A Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) is a living document that is first submitted for
approval to the city and to the KDOW. It will be updated, as necessary, as
development continues. It includes site map(s), an identification of
construction/contractor activities that could cause pollutant discharges into
stormwater and a description of measures or practices to control these
pollutants. The SWPPP is required by KYR10. It includes the EPSC Plan and
Stormwater Management Plan. Once the development plan has been approved, a copy
of the SWPPP must be maintained onsite and should include copies of all permits
issued for the site. Inspection documentation and plan revisions must also be
documented in the SWPPP once site development has begun.
   (C)   Construction EPSC Plan. Once the erosion prevention and sediment
control (EPSC) plan has been approved, it becomes a component of the SWPPP. The
EPSC Plan is a set of plans prepared by or under the direction of a licensed
professional engineer detailing the specific measures and sequencing to be used
to control sediment and erosion on a development site during and after
construction. It includes supporting calculations, a construction schedule, and
schematics and cross-sections for clarification, as well as any other material
in support of the EPSC Plan. As the project progresses, revisions and
modifications should be tracked in the SWPPP, with major modifications
requiring prior approval by the city before implementation.
   (D)   Post-construction Stormwater Quality Management Plan. The post-
construction stormwater quality management plan (P-SWQMP) contains permanent
water quality treatment devices, such as detention structures, outlet
protection, stormwater conveyance devices, and bioretention areas. Once
approved, the P-SWQMP becomes a component of the SWPPP. Some of these
components will not be installed during initial construction activities.
However, knowing the proposed locations during early construction activities
can be beneficial so areas can be appropriately staged. For example, permanent
detention structures can first function as sediment basins. Once permanent
controls have been installed, they should be protected from sediment laden
runoff, as many permanent water quality treatment devices rely on infiltration
for treatment and can easily be overwhelmed.
   (E)   Sites where land disturbance activities are proposed will require a
complete Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) approved by the Issuing
Authority of the City of Berea.
      (1)   The SWPP plan shall be prepared by a licensed engineer. The
engineer shall be required to visit the site, in person, to evaluate the
existing conditions before preparation of the SWPPP. The engineer shall notify
the City of Berea at least five (5) days prior to the visit. The city may
choose to visit the site with the engineer. The engineer shall prepare the
report, including all of the maps and sketches required.
      (2)   The report shall be bound, on 8-1/2" x 11" paper. All plan drawings
shall be folded and inserted (the size and scale of the plans may vary
depending on the nature of the project; some critical areas might require an
enlargement, or "blow-up sheet"). The report may be placed in a folder, binder
or 3-ring binder, depending on the scope and size of the report. If the report
is in a folder or binder, the outside of the folder/binder shall include as a
minimum: Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, the name and address of the
project, any additional documentation to identify the project per City of Berea
requirements, the owner of the project, the consultant's name and contact
information and date of submission.
      (3)   The SWPPP and EPSC plans shall be readily available at the
construction site from the date of project initiation (NOI) to the date of
Notice of Termination (NOT).
      (4)   Format and contents of the SWPPP will follow the outline as
referenced in the Stormwater Manual.
(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14; Am. Ord. No. 06-20, § 1, 3-3-20)
ARTICLE IV. POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 34.300   PURPOSE
   The requirements set forth in this section are intended to establish
policies, procedures, standards and criteria relating to stormwater runoff
quality and quantity, and establish maintenance agreements for long term
operation and maintenance of BMPs.
(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14)
§ 34.301   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
   Post-construction stormwater management in areas undergoing new development
or redevelopment is necessary because runoff from these areas has been shown to
significantly affect receiving water bodies. Post-construction pollutant
loadings will be controlled through the six (6) minimum control measures under
the KPDES stormwater permit.
   (A)   Redevelopment projects are required to meet twenty percent (20%) of
the local water quality standard.
   (B)   The design of structural BMPs shall be by a professional engineer
licensed to practice in the field civil engineering.
   (C)   The property owner shall be responsible for all maintenance and record
keeping and reporting as detailed in the Maintenance Agreement.
   (D)   The City of Berea and its agents shall have right of entry to inspect,
observe, test or perform any other activity related to the operation,
maintenance and function of the stormwater infrastructure.
   (E)   General requirements for post-construction stormwater control
requirements for design, maintenance and a menu of BMPs are located in the
post-construction section of the City of Berea's Stormwater Manual. These
regulations in the manual shall be the standard practice for post-construction
compliance in the City of Berea.
   (F)   Stream corridor protection BMPs shall be utilized to protect
designated streams and waterways through conservation methods. These methods
may include buffer strips, greenways, vegetated channels, stream bank
stabilization and restoration.
   (G)   Impervious area runoff controls shall be utilized to address high
levels of runoff quantity and reduced quality associated with high-density
developments. These controls may include preservation of open space, minimizing
impervious surfaces, porous pavement, utilization of grass swales instead of
curb and gutter, reduced pavement widths and similar measures.
   (H)   Discharge control BMPs shall be utilized to provide flow attenuation
for post-development runoff. These BMPs may include detention facilities,
extended detention basins, retention facilities and artificial wetlands.
   (I)   If a new development or redevelopment project contributes runoff to
downstream receiving waters that are impaired or infrastructure that does not
have sufficient capacity, the city may, at its discretion, require stormwater
management controls greater than the minimum required by this section. Drainage
calculations shall be provided by the developer's engineer to demonstrate the
integration with the downstream hydraulic system.
   (J)   All facilities must be designed to require minimal maintenance to
ensure that the facilities do not become nuisances or health hazards.
Maintenance expectations shall be clearly stated in the maintenance agreement.
   (K)   The Approving Agency of the City of Berea, at its discretion, may
require the developer of a new development or redevelopment project to provide
off-site mitigation of stormwater BMP improvements in priority areas within the
development watershed, when water quality treatment standards cannot be met.
   (L)   The requirements set forth in this section are intended to:
      (1)   Develop and implement strategies which include a combination of
structural and/or non-structural best management practices (BMPs) that prevent
or minimize water quality impacts from developments in the City of Berea.
      (2)   Ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of BMPs.
      (3)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities.
      (4)   Encourage the preservation of floodplains, floodways and open
spaces to protect and benefit the community's quality of life and natural
resources.
(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14; Am. Ord. No. 06-20, § 1, 3-3-20)
§ 34.302   APPLICATION
   (A)   This section shall apply to any of the following:
      (1)   All land disturbance activity for development or redevelopment of
land for residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional use, disturbing
more than one (1) acre of land or less than one (1) acre but part of a larger

(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14)
§ 34.304   MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT
   The city shall require all new development and redevelopment to develop a
maintenance plan and enter into a long-term operation and maintenance agreement
with approved best management practices for all stormwater quality BMPs.
   (A)   Maintenance agreements. Any stormwater management facility or BMP that
is not owned by the City of Berea will be required to have a maintenance
agreement.
      (1)   Any storm water management facility or BMP which services
individual property owners shall be privately owned. General routine
maintenance (controlling vegetative growth and removing debris) shall be
provided by the owner(s). The owner shall maintain a perpetual, non-exclusive
easement that allows for access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the
city. The city has the right, but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency
repairs.
      (2)   Any storm water management facility or BMP which services an
individual residential subdivision in which the facility or BMP is within
designated open areas or serves as an amenity with an established homeowners
association shall be privately owned and maintained consistent with provisions
of this chapter. The owner shall maintain a perpetual, nonexclusive easement
which allows access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The
city has the right, but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (3)   Any storm water management facility or BMP which services
commercial and industrial development shall be privately owned and maintained.
The owner shall maintain a perpetual, nonexclusive easement which allows access
for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The city has the right,
but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (4)   All regional storm water management control facilities proposed by
the owners, if approved and accepted by the city for dedication as a public
regional facility, shall be publicly owned and/or maintained. All other storm
water management control facilities and BMPs shall be privately owned and/or
maintained unless accepted for maintenance by the city.
      (5)   The city may require dedication of privately owned storm water
facilities, which discharge to the city storm water system. This shall be at
the approval of the City Council.
      (6)   The maintenance and proper operation of all privately owned
stormwater management facilities, including nonstructural practices, shall be
ensured through the creation of a formal and enforceable maintenance agreement
that must be approved by the city and recorded in the office of the County
Clerk as a deed restriction on the property prior to final plan approval. This
agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and
inspect the stormwater management practices, and will outline the procedures
and schedule to be followed to perform routine maintenance as necessary to
ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management practice. Maintenance
may include vegetation clearing, mowing, and removing accumulated trash,
debris, sediment pollutants and other forms of pollution. In addition, the
legally binding agreement shall identify the parties responsible for the proper
maintenance of all stormwater treatment practices and include plans for
periodic inspections by the owners, or their designated agent, to ensure proper
performance of the facility. The maintenance agreement shall be consistent with
the terms and conditions of the "Stormwater Control Facility Maintenance
Agreement".
      (7)   The city may accept, at its discretion, dedication of any existing
or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such
facility meets all the requirements of this ordinance and includes adequate and
perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection
and regular maintenance. The city will not accept any facility that serves as
an amenity feature for any property or development. A maintenance agreement
will not be required in this instance.
   (B)   Maintenance easement. The applicant or owner of the site must execute
a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on the owner, its
administrators, executors, assigns, heirs, and any other successors in interest
of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall
provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection
by the City of Berea, or their contractor or agent, to ensure that the facility
is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any
other provisions established by this chapter and to, if necessary, implement
emergency repairs to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. The
easement dimensions shall be as directed by the city and the easement agreement
shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk, with a copy provided to
the city. All stormwater management facilities within subdivision plats shall
also be protected by a permanent easement for the same purposes as above and
also to prohibit any construction on the easement that would be detrimental to
the performance of those facilities.
   (C)   Requirements of maintenance agreements.
      (1)   The post-construction maintenance plan shall ensure that BMPs are
operated and maintained to achieve the goals of this chapter, and not permit
the required facilities from becoming nuisances or health hazards.
      (2)   Written procedures for operation and maintenance and training new
maintenance personnel.
      (3)   An annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs to
ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter and accomplishment of
its purposes. These needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other debris
from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation
removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation.
      (4)   Any maintenance needs found must be identified in writing, along
with the schedule and methods to be employed to complete the maintenance. The
maintenance repairs and restoration schedules are to be approved by the city
prior to commencing the work and the city shall inspect the facility upon
completion of the work. The inspection and maintenance requirement may be
increased by the city as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the
stormwater management facility.
   (D)   Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management
facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and
repairs, and shall retain the records for at least five (5) years. These
records shall be made available to the city during inspection of the facility
and at other reasonable times upon request.
   (E)   Maintenance guarantees for privately owned stormwater facilities.
Single entity ownership - Where the permanent storm water runoff control
facilities are designed to manage runoff from property in a single entity
ownership, the maintenance responsibility for the storm water control
facilities shall be with the single entity owner.
      (1)   A single entity shall be defined as an association, public or
private corporation, partnership firm, trust, estate or any other legal entity
allowed to own real estate exclusive of an individual lot owner.
      (2)   Upon approval of the storm water quality BMPs by the city, the
facility owner(s) shall demonstrate the ability to guarantee and apply the
financial resources necessary for long-term maintenance requirements. The
funding mechanism shall be in a form approved by the city. The city will only
approve funding mechanism(s) for long-term maintenance responsibilities that
can be demonstrated to be permanent or transferable to another entity with
equivalent longevity.
      (3)   In the event that proposed funding is through an owners
association, then it must be demonstrated that the association may not dissolve
unless long-term operation and maintenance activities are accepted by another
entity with equivalent longevity and adequate funding. Furthermore, the owners
association's responsibility must be stated in the association's declaration,
covenants, or by-laws, as appropriate.
      (4)   Unless made specifically clear in the preliminary stages of the
site design and construction plan review procedure, it will be assumed that all
storm water detention, retention, treatment or storage facilities and/or
devices shall be owned, operated and maintained by a single entity as defined
above.
      (5)   Where stormwater management and erosion and sediment control
facilities are to be operated and maintained by the applicant or by a
corporation that owns or manages a commercial or industrial facility, the
applicant, prior to construction, may be required to provide the city with an
irrevocable letter of credit from an approved financial institution or surety
to ensure proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater management and
erosion control facilities both during and after construction, and until the
city acknowledges compliance with all details of approved site plan. If the
applicant or landowner fails to properly operate and maintain stormwater
management and erosion and sediment control facilities, the city may draw upon
the account to cover the costs of proper operation and maintenance, including
engineering and inspection costs, until the city acknowledges compliance with
all details of approved site plan.
   (F)   A fee for BMP inspection may be assessed to an owner for a structural
BMP which is not owner inspected, owner maintained, or where the owner has not
maintained written records of inspection of the BMPs on the property.
   (G)   Unlawful acts. It shall be unlawful for any person to:
      (1)   Not maintain the structural BMPs per the maintenance agreement;
      (2)   Not correct violations noted by the city;
      (3)   Prevent or obstruct the city from entering the property with a
structural BMP per this chapter;
      (4)   Not construct BMPs per the direction of this chapter;
      (5)   Discharge pollutants or effluents not permitted by the NPDES
permit;
      (6)   Falsify records; or
      (7)   Violate any provision of this section.
(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14)
ARTICLE V. ENFORCEMENT
§ 34.400   ENFORCEMENT
   (A)   This chapter shall be enforced by the Enforcement Agency as set out
herein. The Enforcement Agency, to insure compliance with this chapter, may
take the following enforcement steps against persons, companies, developers, or
any other entities in noncompliance with the chapter. The remedies available
include verbal warning, written warning, Notice of Violation (NOV), Stop Work
Order, injunctive relief, and civil and criminal penalties. The Enforcement
Agency will utilize tiered enforcement when practical and when the violation is
not a public nuisance or an immediate danger.
   (B)   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The
Enforcement Agency may take any, all, or combination of these actions against a
violator.
   (C)   Right of entry. The City may perform inspections on property to verify
compliance with this chapter and is authorized to enter the property at
reasonable times to inspect. If the city deems structural BMPs are ineffective
or maintained improperly, the city may take enforcement action as described
below. Whenever the city has cause to believe there exists, or potentially
exists in or upon the property, any condition which constitutes a violation of
this chapter the city is authorized to enter the property at reasonable times
to perform the duties imposed by the chapter. If entry is refused, the city
shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure entry.
(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14)
§ 34.401   ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS
   (A)   Verbal warning. Whenever the city determines that a person, company,
developer or any other entity has violated the Erosion Protection and Sediment
Control plan, the SWPPP, a Post Construction BMP, or any other land disturbance
permit, or failed to meet any other requirement of this section, the city may
order compliance by a verbal warning to the responsible entity as the first
level of enforcement. The warning shall specify the particular violation
believed to have occurred and request the contractor to immediately investigate
and resolve the matter before any additional damage occurs. This warning may be
based on the severity of the violation, site and weather conditions. This
warning will be documented by a written notice or other electronic recordation
of the violation to the contractor.
   (B)   Written warning. Whenever the city finds that a person, company,
developer or any other entity has violated the Erosion Protection and Sediment
Control plan, the SWPPP, a Post Construction BMP, or any other land disturbance
permit, or failed to meet any other requirement of this section, and has not
compiled with a verbal warning, the city may order compliance by a written
warning to the responsible entity. The warning shall specify the particular
violation believed to have occurred and request the contractor to immediately
investigate and resolve the matter before any additional damage occurs. This
warning will be documented by a written notice to the contractor. The warning
notice will contain:
      (1)   The name and address of the alleged violator;
      (2)   The address (when available) or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring or has occurred;
      (3)   A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
      (4)   A statement specifying the established time schedule to restore
compliance.
   (C)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   Whenever the city finds that a person, company, developer or any
other entity has violated the Erosion Protection and Sediment Control plan, the
SWPPP, a Post Construction BMP, or any other land disturbance permit, or failed
to meet any other requirement of this section, and has not complied with a
verbal and/or written warning, the city may issue a Notice of Violation (NOV)
to the responsible entity. The NOV shall specify the particular violation
believed to have occurred, the required remediation, and a penalty for the
violation. Offenses enforced through a NOV must be corrected within five (5)
calendar days of the date of issuance or a Stop Work Order (SWO) will be
issued.
      (2)   This warning will be documented by posting a written notice at the
construction site and also a copy shall be mailed by first class mail, postage
pre-paid, to the address listed by the contractor on the permit. In the case of
work for which there is no permit, a copy of the violation and/or order shall
be mailed to the person listed as the landowner of the property.
   (D)   Stop Work Order.
      (1)   Whenever the city finds that a person, company, developer or any
other entity has violated the Erosion Protection and Sediment Control plan, the
SWPPP, a Post Construction BMP, or any other land disturbance permit, or failed
to meet any other requirement of this section, and has not complied with a
Notice of Violation (NOV), a Stop Work Order (SWO) will be issued to the
contractor. Failure to follow a Stop Work Order issued by the City of Berea
will result in suspension of permits that have been issued for the site. The
NOV shall specify the particular violation believed to have occurred, the
required remediation, and a penalty for the violation.
      (2)   The contractor shall immediately stop work on all other activities
at the site and work directly on sediment control compliance issues. Only
permit violation correction work is permitted until the Stop Work order is
lifted. When the site is found acceptable, the City of Berea will reinstate the
permit upon receipt of all accrued penalties imposed on the project site. The
contractor is subject to daily civil fines if found working under a suspended
permit. The SWO will be documented by posting a written notice at the
construction site and also a copy shall be mailed by first class mail, postage
pre-paid, to the address listed by the contractor on the permit. In the case of
work for which there is no permit, a copy of the violation and/or order shall
be mailed to the person listed as the landowner of the property.
   (E)   An offense of the same nature as a previous offense, even if
previously corrected under a NOV, will constitute a second offense and may be
enforced through a SWO.
   (F)   For violations where no Land Disturbance Permit has been issued, the
City of Berea will notify the responsible party and cooperate for resolution
prior to enforcement. Should the responsible party not cease the land
disturbance activity the City of Berea may request the City Attorney to seek
injunctive relief.
   (G)   Six (6) calendar days after posting a Stop-Work Order, the City of
Berea may issue a notice of intent to the contractor, landowner, or land user
stating the City of Berea's intent to perform work necessary to eliminate the
violation. The City of Berea may enter onto the land and commence work after
fourteen (14) days from issuing the notice of intent. The costs incurred by the
City of Berea to perform this work shall be paid by the landowner or contractor
out of the fiscal surety referred to in this section, to the extent that the
amount is covered thereby, with the remainder being directly due and owed by
the landowner or contractor. In the event no Land Disturbance Permit was issued
or no bond was posted, the cost, plus interest at the rate authorized by the
City of Berea, plus a reasonable administrative and attorneys fee shall be
billed to the contractor or owner. Failure to reimburse the city within thirty
(30) days will result in a lien being placed on the property.
   (H)   Compliance with the provisions of this section may also be enforced by
injunction.
   (I)   The city may require immediate abatement of any violation of this
section that constitutes an immediate threat to the health, safety or well-
being of the public. If any such violation is not abated immediately, the city
is authorized to enter onto private property and to take any and all measures
required to remediate the violation. Any expense related to such remediation
undertaken by the City of Berea shall be fully reimbursed by the property owner
and/or responsible party. The cost, plus interest at the rate authorized by the
City of Berea, plus a reasonable administrative and attorneys fee shall be
billed to the owner. Failure to reimburse the city within thirty (30) days of
notice will result in a lien being placed on the property.
   (J)   For the purpose of this section, the ultimate party responsible for
assuring compliance with the conditions set forth is the property owner.
   (K)   Abatement by the city. If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the NOV, or, in the event of an
appeal, within ten (10) days of the decision to uphold the NOV, then the City
or designated contractor shall enter upon the subject private premises and is
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or
restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or
person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the Enforcement Agency
of the City of Berea or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for
the purposes set forth above.
   (L)   Charging cost of abatement/liens.
      (1)   Within thirty (30) days after abatement of the nuisance by the
city, the city shall notify the property owner of the premise of the cost of
abatement, including administrative costs.
      (2)   If the amount due is not paid within ten (10) days, the City Clerk
shall enter the amount due on the tax roll and collect as a special assessment
against the property and such amount shall constitute a lien on the property.
(Ord. No. 24-14, § 1, 12-16-14)
§ 34.402   APPEALS
   (A)   Any person affected by a decision, notice, or order, of the
Enforcement Agency, shall have the right to appeal to the Code Enforcement
Board by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within seven (7)
days after the decision, notice, or order was served or made effective. The
filing fees for a Notice of Appeal shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and
shall be paid upon filing the Notice of Appeal.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a Notice of Appeal, the Code Enforcement Board shall
convene a hearing to consider the appeal within fourteen (14) days of receipt.
All parties to the appeal shall be notified of the time and place of the

ARTICLE V. SIGN MAINTENANCE POLICY
§ 41.500   PURPOSE
   The purpose of the sign maintenance policy is to establish and maintain
uniform practices concerning sign maintenance for city streets and roadways.
The policy is intended to set out the evaluation and assessment method employed
by the city for the general maintenance of traffic signage and adequate sign
retroreflectivity. The method described herein consists of routine daytime
reviews for post or sign misalignment, damage, theft, or deterioration, and a
nighttime biennial visual assessment of all signs in a specified area to assure
adequate retroreflectivity.
(Ord. No. 10-2012, 8-7-12)
§ 41.501   PROCEDURE
   Individual operators and maintenance crews travel the city streets to and
from specific work assignments each work day in all parts of the city's service
area. Such persons are instructed to report any apparent problems (such as
vision obstruction, vandalism, collision damage, or substandard appearing
traffic control devices) to the street superintendent, where a maintenance work
order for any needed repairs will be initiated. Local police officers who
patrol the streets are also instructed to report any traffic control device
deficiencies that are observed, including any collision damage. Other public
service staff, including meter readers, zoning and parks personnel have also
been instructed to report observed traffic control device deficiencies that
might be observed during work travels throughout the community.
(Ord. No. 10-2012, 8-7-12)
§ 41.502   RETROREFLECTIVITY ASSESSMENT
   To assure continued compliance with minimum retro-reflectivity requirements
the city has adopted a "measured sign retroreflectivity" assessment method.
This method consists of regular inspections with each sign being measured once
in every twenty-four (24) month time period. These inspections are done in
daylight with the retroreflectivity being measured using a hand-held, portable,
contact reflectometer. This device provides a standardized methodology for
measuring retroreflectivity pursuant to ASTM E1709. In the course of these
inspections the city may employ department personnel or outside contractors to
secure these measurements. Once out on the intended route the inspector gives
each road sign a pass/fail mark on either a printed or electronic inventory for
the particular route being inspected at that time. A repair work order is then
generated from this inventory and all signs found to be sub-standard will be
replaced in a timely manner.
(Ord. No. 10-2012, 8-7-12)
§ 41.503   RECORD KEEPING
   The street department superintendent shall maintain an ongoing log of all
inspections and assessments set out in this article for the purpose of
providing information for the city to reinspect signs on a more frequent basis
in the event such signs are found to be approaching retroreflective limits or
for other reasons.
(Ord. No. 10-2012, 8-7-12)
§ 41.999 PENALTIES

a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined for the first offense, not
less than ten ($10.00) dollars nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00); for

attached to the written report. The codes enforcement officer shall keep all

(Ord. No. 14.90, 6-10-90)
§ 50.004 ABATEMENT
   (A)   Upon determining that a public nuisance exists and that there is
danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, the codes
enforcement officer shall serve a notice of the public nuisance or cause a
notice to be served on the owner or occupant of the property where the public
nuisance exists or upon the person causing, permitting, or maintaining the
nuisance. A copy of the notice shall be posted on the premises where the public
nuisance exists.
   (B)   The notice shall specifically describe the public nuisance and shall
direct the owner or the occupant of the private property where the public
nuisance exists or the person causing, permitting or maintaining the nuisance
to abate or remove the nuisance within twenty-four (24) hours of service or
posting of the notice. If the owner, occupant, or person cannot be located
after reasonable inquiry, posting shall be sufficient notice. The notice shall
state that unless the nuisance is so abated or removed the city will cause it
to be abated or removed, that the cost will be charged to the owner, occupant,
or person causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance and that the cost
shall be a lien on the real property where the nuisance was abated or removed.
The notice shall also state that failure of the owner, occupant, or person to
abate the nuisance as required by the notice shall be deemed an implied consent
for the city to abate or remove the nuisance. The implied consent shall be
deemed to form a contract between the owner, occupant, or person and the city.
If the public nuisance does not constitute a great and immediate danger to the
public health, safety, or welfare, the codes enforcement officer may serve the
owner or occupant of the premises or the person in whose name the real estate
was last billed for property tax purposes a notice to demand the abatement or
removal of the violation within five (5) days. Service may be had by personal
service, certified mail, or first class mail, provided that there shall be a
presumption that first class mail which is not returned to the codes office
wihtin five (5) days of mailing was received in fact by the addressee.
   (C)   If a nuisance is not abated or removed after notice pursuant to this
section and within the time specified in the notice, the codes enforcement
officer may cause the abatement or removal of the public nuisance. The
reasonable cost thereof shall be a lien on the real property where the nuisance
was abated or removed.
   (D)   The owner or occupant of the private property where the public
nuisance exists who fails to abate or to remove the nuisance required by this
section, thereby consents, under the terms of this section, to have the city
abate or remove the nuisance. Further, the owner or occupant thereby also
consents to the formation of a contract between the owner and occupant and the
city for the payment of costs in relation to abatement or removal of the
nuisance.
   (E)   The person upon whom a notice to abate a nuisance is served, the
property owner, tenant, or other affected person may appeal the determination
of a nuisance, in writing, pursuant to §
22.605 of this code. The written appeal must be made within the time period in
which to abate the nuisance is given in the notice. The codes enforcement
officer or his/her designee shall meet with the appellant within five (5)
working days of the receipt of the written appeal. The codes enforcement
officer or his/her designee may extend the time in which the nuisance must be
abated, determine that a nuisance does not or no longer exists, or that the
nuisance must be abated within the time period set out in the notice or
immediately if the period has run. Provided, however, that if the nuisance was
determined to be an emergency and that the opportunity for an appeal was not
available due to the short period of time to abate the nuisance, an appeal may
be heard after the abatement of the nuisance by the city. In that event, the
Code Enforcement Board may determine that the appellant is liable for the
costs, or that, upon good cause shown, that the appellant is not liable for the
costs and that a lien shall not be filed by the city upon the property. The
notice to abate shall contain a statement as to the right of appeal.
(Ord. No. 14.90, 6-19-90; Amd. Ord. No. 14-97, 7-1-97)
   (F)   Emergencies. In the event that the Code Enforcement Officer determines
in writing that a condition is so menacing to the public health, peace, or
safety that it is necessary that it be summarily abated, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall specify in writing the condition and the basis for the emergency,
and shall maintain such writing in the Code Enforcement Office.
(Ord. No. 14.90, 6-19-90; Amd. Ord. No. 14-97, 7-1-97; Amd. Ord. No. 03-06,
passed 1-14-06)
§ 50.005 LIEN AUTHORIZED
   (A)   Whenever a bill for the reasonable costs of abatement or removal of a
nuisance pursuant to this chapter remains unpaid for thirty (30) days after it
has been sent, the cost shall be placed upon the city's tax books against the
property and may be collected, and the liens may be foreclosed, in the same
manner as taxes and tax liens are collected and foreclosed, in the same manner
as taxes and tax liens are collected and foreclosed, or by other civil suit or
process as the corporation counsel may determine. In addition, the city shall
have a lien on the property in the amount of such costs and the expense of
preparing any lien statements provided for hereafter. The clerk may file a
notice of lien with the Madison County Clerk, pursuant to state law but failure
to file such notice shall not invalidate the lien provided for herein. Unpaid
bills for the cost of abatement shall bear interest at the rate of twelve
percent (12%) per annum, compounded annually. Any notice of lien pursuant to
this chapter shall be filed within ninety (90) days after the cost and expense
of abatement or removal of nuisance has been incurred by the city. The notice
shall consist of a sworn statement setting out:
      (1)   A description of the real estate sufficient for identification
thereof;
      (2)   The amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred or
payable for the service; and
      (3)   The date or dates when the costs and expense was incurred by the
city.
    (B)   Any purchaser whose rights in and to the real estate have arisen
subsequent to removal of the public nuisance and prior to the filing of the
notice shall not be held personally liable for the costs of abatement or
removal, and the lien of the city shall not have priority as to any mortgage,
judgment creditor or other lienor whose rights in and to the real estate arise
prior to the filing of the notice, but the property shall be subject to the
lien and addition to the tax bill provided for herein.
   (C)   Costs and expenses under this chapter include, but are not limited to
the actual costs and expenses in time of city employees or city authorized
contractors and in materials concerning the actual actions of abatement of the
nuisance pursuant to this chapter, transportation to and from the property,
title searches, or certifications, preparations of lien documents, foreclosure
and other related expenses, including, but not limited to reasonable attorney's
expenses.
   (D)   A copy of the notice of lien shall be mailed by the clerk to the owner
of the property, or to the occupant, or to the person or persons in whose name
the real estate was last billed for property tax purposes.
   (E)   The city may enforce the lien by action initiated in the Madison
Circuit Court for the unpaid assessment of the costs and expenses, and the
proceeds of the sale applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs.
   (F)   The city may institute proceedings in any court having jurisdiction
over the matters against any property for which the costs and expenses have
remained unpaid for thirty (30) days after a statement of the costs and
expenses have been mailed to the property owner, to the occupant, or to the
person or persons in whose name the property was last billed for property tax
purposes.
   (G)   After notice of lien has been filed and upon payment of the costs and
expenses plus interest from the date thirty (30) days after the bill was sent,
the clerk shall file with the Madison County clerk a release of the lien.
   (H)   If payment of the city's costs of removal or abatement of the nuisance
is not paid to the city within thirty (30) days of the filing of the notice of
the lien, the city council is empowered to commence proceedings in the Circuit
Court seeking a personal judgment from the owner of or persons interested in
the property at the time the complaint for removal or abatement was filed with
the Circuit Clerk in the amount of the costs. The action shall be based upon
the implied consent for persons to form a contract for the removal or abatement
of the nuisances. The action authorized by this subsection shall be in addition
to, and without waiver of, any other remedy.

traffic contiguous to its route or location;

assembly points of the parade or public assembly will not unduly interfere with
proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous
to such public assembly areas;

likely to cause injury to persons or property;
      (5)   The parade or public assembly is scheduled to move from its point

§ 54.500 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
   (A)   Numerous studies have concluded that tobacco smoke is a major

with obstructive airway disease; and
   (B)   Secondhand smoke has been classified as a Group A carcinogen like
asbestos by the Environmental Protection Agency; and

to citizens limiting full access to the use of city-owned buildings and
vehicles; and
   (D)   In order to provide a safe workplace for city employees and to ensure
maximum access for the public to city-owned buildings and vehicles, the City
Council finds and declares that the purposes of this article are:
      (1)   To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in
city-owned buildings and vehicles; and
      (2)   To guarantee the right to breath smoke-free air, recognizing that
the need to breath smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

in the table and shall be paid in advance of engaging in the activity.

one (1) type of activity in one (1) business entity, the highest minimum
license fee shall apply.

continuously, payment must be made prior to the beginning of operations.
   (D)   License fee renewal.  In any tax year, it shall be unlawful for any

activity in the city without first having renewed and paid for the minimum

Division 3. Occupational Licenses
§ 60.200 OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE TAX PAYMENT REQUIRED
   (A)   Except as provided in subsection (E) of this section, every person or

entity that is required to make a filing with the Internal Revenue Service of
the Kentucky Revenue Cabinet shall be required to file and pay to the city an
occupational license tax for the privilege of engaging in such activities
within the city. The occupational license tax shall be measured by two percent
(2%) of:
      (1)   All wages and compensation paid or payable in the city for work
done or service performed or rendered in the city by every resident and
nonresident who is an employee;
      (2)   The net profit from business conducted in the city by a resident or
nonresident business entity.
      (3)   Minimum fee. In the event the tax payment required under division
(2) is less than an amount sufficient to yield an annual license tax calculated
at two percent (2%) of net income, equal to or in excess of the minimum license
taxes of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), then the minimum license tax of twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) shall apply and be charged.
   (B)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entitles where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in the chapter is assessed against income before it is
“passed through” these entities to the owners.
   (C)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (D)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting, and
accounting procedures shall be as nearly as practicable identical with those
required for federal income tax purposes.
   (E)   The following businesses are exempt and are not required to file
occupational license tax on net profits:
      (1)   Any bank, trust company, combined bank and trust company, or trust,
banking and title insurance company organized and doing business in this state,
any savings and loan association whether state or federally chartered;
      (2)   Public service corporations that pay an ad valorem tax on property
valued and assessed by the Kentucky Department of Revenue pursuant to the
provisions of KRS 136.120. License whose businesses are predominatingly non-
public service who are also engaged in public service activity are required to
pay a license fee on their net profit denied from the non-public service
activities apportioned to the city;
      (3)   Life insurance companies incorporated under laws of and doing
business in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
   (F)   The following businesses are exempt from occupational license tax on
net profits, but are required to file a net profit return:
      (1)   Individuals and fiduciaries who receive income from the rental of
real property with gross receipts received from the rental of such real
property in the city less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) as described
in §
60.211.
      (2)   Persons or business entitles that have issued a license under KRS
Chapter 243 to engage in manufacturing or trafficking in alcoholic beverages
are required to file a return, but may exclude the portion of their net profits
derived from the manufacturing or trafficking in alcoholic beverages.
      (3)   Any usual activities of boards of trade, chambers of commerce,
trade associations or unions, community chest funds or foundations;
corporations or associations organized and operated exclusively for religious,
charitable, scientific, literary, educational, or civic purposes, or for the
prevention of cruelty to children or animals; or clubs or fraternal
organizations operated exclusively for social, literary, educational or
fraternal purposes where no part of the income or receipts of such units, group
or associations inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.
To qualify for this exemption, the organization must submit satisfactory proof
of their exempt status for federal income tax purposes. If any part of the
earnings of such business inures to the benefit of any person, it shall be
sufficient to defeat the exemption. If an organization earns “unrelated
business income,” as defined and administered in § 511 of the Internal Revenue
Code, a net profit license tax is assessed on the “unrelated business income.”
   (G)   The following persons are exempt from the employee occupational
license tax:
      (1)   Any compensation received by members of the Kentucky National Guard
for active duty training, unit training assemblies and annual field training;
      (2)   Any compensation received by precinct workers for election training
or work at election booths in state, county, and local primary, regular, or

§ 60.201 APPORTIONMENT
   (A)   Except as provided in subsection (D) of this section, net profit shall
be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in subsection (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in subsection (C) of this section,
and the denominator of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sales, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than

city regardless of the f.o.b point or other condition of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income- producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will

ARTICLE V. PAWNSHOPS, JUNK, SCRAP METAL, SECOND HAND STORES, AND SECOND HAND
DEALERS.
§ 60.600 PURPOSE
   The purpose of this subchapter is to prevent pawnshops, secondhand dealers,
junk dealers, and scrap metal dealers and similar businesses from being used as
facilities for the commission of crime. The City Council finds that the pawn
industry has outgrown the City's current ability to effectively or efficiently
identify crime activity related to pawnshops, scrap metal, second hand dealers,
and precious metal dealers can also be compromised by others in the commission
of crimes. To assure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection
standards and to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the
citizens of the City, the City Council therefore finds consumer protection
regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers, secondhand
dealers, and precious metal dealers. To help law enforcement better regulate
current and future pawnshops, secondhand dealers, junk dealers, and scrap metal
dealers and similar businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with
regulation of these businesses, and increase identification of criminal
activities in these businesses through the timely collection and sharing of
pawn transaction information, this subchapter also implements and establishes
the required use of the Leads Online, Automated Pawn System (APS), or similar
system.

§ 63.001 GENERAL PROVISIONS
   (A)   Declaration of findings. The city hereby declares as a legislative
finding that the rights-of-way controlled by the city:
      (1)   Are a unique and physically limited resource;
      (2)   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in
the city;
      (3)   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
      (4)   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of providers of
communications service, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general
economic well-being of the city and its citizens; and
      (5)   Should be subject to specific additional regulations imposed in a
competitively neutral, non-discriminatory, and non-discretionary manner as
established by this chapter to ensure coordination of providers of
communications service, maximize available space, and facilitate entry of a
maximum number of providers of communications service and other services in the
public interest.
   (B)   Title. This chapter may be referred to and cited as the
"Communications Service Franchise Ordinance."
   (C)   Applicability. The requirements of this chapter shall apply to the
full extent of the terms herein and shall be limited in scope or application
only to the extent as may be required by applicable federal or state law,
including such changes in applicable law as may be hereinafter enacted. No
provisions of this chapter shall be disregarded pursuant to this subsection
except on express application to and determination by the city to such effect
based on the specific factual circumstances demonstrated. The provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed incorporated in each franchise granted.
   (D)   Preservation of authority. Any rights granted pursuant to this chapter
and pursuant to any franchise authorized hereunder are subject to the authority
of the city to adopt and enforce generally applicable ordinances necessary to
the health, safety, and welfare of the public, as may be amended from time to
time (to the extent not in conflict with state or federal law, or franchisee's
franchise). Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to waive a right, if any,
that any party may have to seek judicial or regulatory review as to the
provisions herein or as to actions of the parties under applicable federal,
state, or local law currently in effect or as may hereinafter be amended.
   (E)   Public inspection of records. Certain information required to be filed
with the city pursuant to this chapter is subject to inspection and copying by
the public pursuant to the provisions of the Kentucky Open Records Act, KRS
61.870 et seq.
   (F)   Indemnification. As a condition of use of the rights-of-way, each
franchisee at its sole cost and expense, shall indemnify, protect, defend and
hold harmless the city, its elected officials, officers, employees, and agents,
from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities,
fines, charges, penalties, administrative and judicial proceedings and orders,
judgments, remedial actions of any kind, and all costs and expenses of any
kind, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
defense arising, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, out of or in
relation to the city's award of the franchise to that franchisee, the rights
granted to the franchisee, or the activities performed, or failed to be
performed, by such franchisee under the franchise or use of the rights-of-way,
except to the extent such acts or use arise from or are caused by the
negligence or willful misconduct of the city, its elected officials, officers,
or employees. A franchisee's indemnification under this provision does not
apply to any franchisee claims, demands, proceedings, or remedial actions
against the city. This indemnification shall survive the expiration or
termination of any franchise or use of the rights-of-way. The city shall give
franchisee written notice of its obligation to indemnify the city within ten
(10) days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this section. In the
event any such claim arises, the city shall tender the defense thereof to the
franchisee and the franchisee shall have the right to defend, settle, or
compromise any claims arising hereunder and the city shall cooperate fully
herein. If the city determines in good faith that its interests cannot be
represented by the franchisee, the franchisee shall be excused from any
obligation to indemnify the city.
   (G)   Compliance with laws. In performing activities and exercising rights
and obligations under any franchise, each franchisee and other holder of a
franchise shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws, and,
consistent with §
63.001(D), local laws, ordinances, regulations and policies, including, but not
limited to, all laws, ordinances, regulations and policies relating to
construction and use of rights-of-way.
   (H)   Enforcement; attorneys' fees. The city shall be entitled to enforce
this chapter and any franchise granted hereunder through all remedies lawfully
available and each franchisee shall pay the city its costs of enforcement,
including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees, in the event that
franchisee is determined judicially to have violated the terms of this
franchise.
   (I)   Relationship of the parties. Under no circumstances shall any
franchise authorized by this chapter be construed to create any relationship of
agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment between the city and the
franchisee.

63.007.
   (B)   Franchises nonexclusive. The authority granted by the city in any
franchise shall be for the nonexclusive use of the rights-of-way. The city

franchises or other rights to use the rights-of-way for any purpose to any
other person, including itself, as it deems appropriate, subject to all
applicable laws.
   (C)   Nature of rights granted by any franchise. Franchises shall not convey

chapter and as may be further modified by the franchise in a nondiscriminatory
and competitively neutral manner. No franchise may excuse franchisee from

Franchises shall be granted in accordance with Kentucky Constitution Sections
163 and 164. The city shall grant franchises or renewals to any eligible
franchisee for the right and privilege to construct, own, operate, repair,
replace and maintain facilities in, through and along the city's rights-of-way
for the purposes of providing communications service on a nonexclusive basis
within the city, subject, however, to the standards, terms and conditions
herein set forth within this chapter, and any special conditions as may be
provided for in the franchise. All franchisees shall be required to obtain and
maintain any necessary and lawful permit, license certification, grant,
registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate
governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the city, the FCC and the
PSC. The city may establish standard franchises setting forth the minimum
requirements for all franchisees. Renewals of franchises granted to cable
operators shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of Section 626 of
the federal Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546, or any such successor statute, and
applicable law.
   (F)   Acceptance and effective date of franchise. Any franchise granted
hereunder, together with the rights, privileges and authority granted thereby,
shall take effect and be in force from and after the effective date of a
resolution granting a franchise hereunder, provided that on or before that date
franchisee shall:
      (1)   Enter into and execute such agreements and documents as required by
the city that are consistent with the terms and provisions of this chapter and
applicable law;
      (2)   File such bond or bonds as required in this chapter; and
      (3)   Advise the city in writing of franchisee's address for mail and
official notifications from the city.
   (G)   Use of rights-of-way; police powers; franchisee's use subordinate. A
franchisee shall construct and maintain its facilities in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local laws, including all permit requirements and
associated fee payments, and all other city codes and ordinances in effect as
of the date of the award of its franchise or thereafter adopted or amended, to
the extent permitted by state or federal law, subject to §
63.001(D). The grant of a franchise does not in any way affect the continuing
authority of the city through the proper exercise of its home rule or statutory
powers to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to provide for the health,
safety and welfare of the public. The city makes no express or implied
representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation
or construction of facilities on any particular segment of rights-of-way. The
burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of
construction or installation shall be entirely upon the franchisee. The use of
the rights-of-way authorized by any franchise shall in all matters be
subordinate to the city's use and rights therein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing:
      (1)   All rights and privileges granted herein are subject to the police
powers of the city and its rights under applicable laws and regulations to
regulate the construction, operation, and maintenance of franchisee's system,
subject to §
63.001(D), including, but not limited to, the right to adopt and enforce
additional ordinances and regulations as the city shall find necessary in the
exercise of its police powers, the right to adopt and enforce applicable
zoning, building, permitting and safety ordinances and regulations, the right
to adopt and enforce regulations relating to equal employment opportunities,
and the right to adopt and enforce ordinances and regulations concerning the
rights-of-way and utility standards.
      (2)   The city reserves the right to exercise its police powers. Any
conflict between the provisions of this chapter or a franchise and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers shall be resolved
in favor of the police powers.
      (3)   Franchisee shall not be excused from complying with any of the
requirements of this chapter or any subsequently adopted amendments to this
chapter, by any failure of the city on any one or more occasions to seek, or
insist upon, compliance with such requirements or provisions.
   (H)   Emergencies.
      (1)   Franchisee shall assign a management level individual to coordinate
with, and assist the city in the development of emergency plans.
      (2)   If at any time, in case of fire or disaster or other emergency
situation in the city, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of
the city to cut, raise, lower, or relocate any facilities, such cutting,
raising, lowering, or relocating may be done, and any repairs rendered
necessary thereby shall be made by franchisee, at its sole expense.
   (I)   Term. A franchise shall be for a term not to exceed twenty (20) years.
   (J)   Franchise fees. During any period of time which the city opts to
forego imposing a franchise fee and to instead participate in the multichannel
video programming and service tax system set forth under KRS 136.600 et seq., a
franchisee shall not be required to pay franchise fees. Before imposing
franchise fees, the city will provide at least sixty (60) days' prior written
notice to current franchisees before the first payment will be due. If at any
time the city elects to exercise its constitutional right to impose and collect
franchise fees, franchisee's first franchise fee payment under this chapter
shall be paid to the city the later of one hundred twenty (120) days after such
election, or thirty (30) days after the last day of the first calendar quarter
expiring after franchisee received written notice from the city that the city
has opted to exercise its constitutional right to impose and collect franchisee
fees.
   (K)   Timing of payment of franchise fees. Unless otherwise agreed to in
writing, all franchise fees shall be due and payable on a quarterly basis and
payment shall be made on or before the date which is thirty (30) calendar days
after the last day of the calendar quarter for which the payment applies (the
"due date"); provided, however, that in the event that a franchisee ceases to
provide communications service for any reason (including as a result of a sale
or transfer of the franchisee's system), such franchisee shall make a final
payment of any amounts owed to the city on or before the date which is thirty
(30) calendar days after the date on which its operations in the city cease
(which shall be deemed a "due date" for purposes of this chapter).
   (L)   Interest on late payments and under payments. If any franchise fee, or
any portion thereof, is not received by the city on or before the due date,
interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the rate of
1.5% per month, unless such other maximum rate is established by applicable
law.
   (M)   Fee statement. In the event that the city imposes a franchise fee, any
franchise fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement (a "fee statement")
showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated. Within ninety
(90) calendar days following the end of any calendar year in which the city
imposes a franchise fee, each franchisee shall submit a statement, certified as
true, setting forth the amount of linear feet of rights-of-way occupied by it
facilities, provided, however, that in the event that a franchisee ceases to
provide communications service for any reason (including as a result of a
transfer), such franchisee shall provide such a statement within thirty (30)
calendar days after the date on which its operations in the city cease. In
calculating the amount of linear feet of rights-of-way occupied by its
facilities, a franchise shall include all facilities, including antenna and
other wireless facilities, and all facilities whether installed underneath the
rights-of-way or on poles.
   (N)   No accord and satisfaction. No acceptance by the city of any franchise
fee or any other payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid
is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee or any
other payment be construed as a release of any claim of the city.
   (O)   Description of communications service. During the term of the
franchise, franchisee shall provide the city with a description of any material
changes to the types of communications service offered over its facilities in
the rights-of-way within the city during the prior year. Any individual
communications service or item for which the franchisee has a separate charge
shall be considered a separate communications service.
   (P)   Franchise fee not a tax; payment of taxes. The franchise fee is
compensation for the use of the rights-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a
tax of any kind. The franchise fees required herein shall be in addition to,
not in lieu of, any and all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and
impositions otherwise applicable to franchisee that are or may be imposed by
the city. A franchisee shall be fully responsible for the payment of all
applicable taxes.
   (Q)   Assignment of franchise. A franchisee shall provide the city with
written notice of any transfer or assignment of the franchise. A franchisee
shall not sell, assign, sublet, dispose of or otherwise transfer a franchise
(or any of the rights or privileges granted by such franchise), franchisee's
system, or control of franchisee to another entity other than by operation of
law or to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
the franchisee, without the prior written consent of the city. No such consent
shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other
hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the
franchisee in the franchise or system to secure indebtedness. The city's
consent to such a transfer shall not be withheld if the acquiring entity would
have qualified for an original franchise had it applied and if the acquiring
entity demonstrates it has the same or equivalent insurance coverage and bonds
in place as is required of the original franchisee. Nothing in any approval by
the city of any transfer pursuant to this section shall be construed to waive,
release or delegate any rights or powers of the city to hold the original
franchisee liable for any violation of its franchise.
   (R)   Forfeiture of franchise and privilege. In case of failure on the part
of a franchisee, its successors and assigns, to comply with any of the material
provisions of this chapter or its franchise, or if the franchisee, its
successors and assigns, should do or cause to be done any material act or thing
prohibited by or in violation of this chapter or the terms of its franchise,
the franchisee, its successors and assigns, shall forfeit all rights and
privileges permitted by this chapter and its franchise, and all rights
hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, provided that said
forfeiture shall not take effect until the city shall carry out the proceedings
specified in §
63.010(B).
   (S)   Security for payment of fees.
      (1)   In the event that the city imposes a franchise fee, every
franchisee shall provide to the city an irrevocable letter of credit in the
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), or one half of the annual
franchise fee owed, whichever is less, to secure the payment of the franchise
fee for the first two (2) years in which the franchisee is subject to a
franchise fee. If, thereafter, there has been no default in paying the
franchise fee nor any late payment of the franchise fee, the letter of credit
shall be released.
      (2)   This division is inoperative during any period of time during which
the city elects to participate in the state baseline and local growth funds
under KRS 136.600 et seq., and to have franchisees taxed accordingly.
   (T)   Special rules for governmental entities. Nothing herein requires the
city to apply the provisions of this chapter to a governmental entity if the
city determines that it is not in the public interest to do so, and nothing in
this chapter shall be read to require a governmental entity to comply with this
chapter where the city cannot enforce the ordinance against such entity as a
matter of law. The city is authorized to enter into agreements with other
governmental agencies to facilitate the city's use and management of the
rights-of-way, and such agreements shall be enforceable according to their
respective terms and notwithstanding any provision of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 04-2021, § 1, 3-2-21)
§ 63.003 RIGHTS-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT AND FACILITIES REQUIREMENTS
   (A)   Encroachment permit. A franchisee shall be subject to and comply with
the additional or supplementary terms and conditions of any encroachment on
rights-of-way permit, as may be amended from time to time, subject to §
63.001(D).
   (B)   Subsection intentionally left blank.
   (C)   Removal of facilities. Upon expiration of a franchise, whether by
lapse of time, by agreement between the franchisee and the city, or by
forfeiture thereof, the franchisee shall remove, at its sole cost, from the
rights-of-way any and all of its facilities that are the subject of such
franchise within a reasonable time after such expiration, not to exceed ninety
(90) days, and, it shall be the duty of the franchisee immediately upon such
removal to restore the rights-of-way from which the facilities are removed to
as good condition as the same were before the removal was effected and as
required by the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may allow
facilities to be left in place when the city determines in its sole discretion
that it is not practical or desirable to require removal.
   (D)   Relocation of facilities. Whenever the city shall in its exercise of
the public interest request of the franchisee to relocate or reinstall any of
its facilities, the franchisee shall, within ten (10) days remove, relocate, or
reinstall any such facilities as may be reasonably necessary to meet the
request. The cost of such relocation, removal, or reinstallation of the
facilities shall be the exclusive obligation of the franchisee. Upon request of
any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a validly
issued building or moving permit of the city, a franchisee shall, within ten
(10) days, temporarily raise, lower, or relocate its wires or other facilities
as may be required for the person to exercise the rights under the permit;
provided, however, that the franchisee may require such permit holder to make
payment to franchisee in advance for any expenses incurred by the franchisee to
temporarily move its facilities pursuant to such person's request.
   (E)   Franchisee responsible for costs. A franchisee shall be responsible
for all reasonable costs incurred by the city that are directly associated with
the franchisee's erecting, installing, maintaining, operating, repairing,
replacing, removing or restoring its facilities in the rights-of-way. A
franchisee shall be responsible for its own costs incurred in removing or
relocating its facilities when required by the city due to the city
requirements relating to maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for the city
purposes.
   (F)   Insurance and bonds. During the term of any franchise, a franchisee
shall obtain and maintain at its sole expense, all insurance and bonds required
by this chapter. It is expressly understood that the city does not in any way
represent that the specified limits of liability or coverage or policy forms
are sufficient or adequate to protect the interest or liabilities of
franchisee.
      (1)   Franchisee shall file with the city a franchise bond in the amount
of fifty thousand dollars ($50,0000.00). In the event there are no claims
against the franchise bond within the first two years of the franchise,
franchisee may reduce the amount of the franchise bond to twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000.00).A franchisee seeking to construct or install a system in
the city shall file with the city a performance bond in an amount to be
determined by the city. In no event shall the amount of the performance bond
required by the city exceed the reasonable costs of repairing the rights-of-way
in the event of non-performance by the franchisee. The performance bond shall
provide for the faithful performance of construction and installation of
franchisee's system. One year after demonstration of the completion of the
construction of the system by franchisee to the city, the city shall release
the performance bond.
      (2)   The performance bond shall indemnify the city in its own right and
as trustee, from any damages or losses arising out of the failure of franchisee
to faithfully perform and satisfactorily complete construction of the system in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The failure of franchisee to comply with its obligations under this
chapter or the franchise as determined by the city shall entitle the city to
draw against either or both of franchisee's performance bonds, subject to §
63.010(B)(2)(b).
      (4)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the performance and
franchise bonds required hereunder are in addition to all other rights of the
city, whether reserved by this chapter or authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such performance or franchise
bonds shall affect any other rights the city may have.
      (5)   Unless otherwise released by the city, the performance or franchise
bonds required hereunder shall not expire or be materially altered without
thirty (30) days written notice and without securing and delivering to the city
a substitute, renewal and replacement bond in conformance with this chapter. In
the event the city does draw monies against the performance bond required
hereunder, within ten (10) days thereafter, franchisee shall pay such funds to
the bonding company as necessary to bring said performance and/or franchise
bonds back to the applicable principal, where it shall continue to be
maintained. The performance and franchise bonds required hereunder shall
contain the following endorsements:
      "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be reduced,
altered or canceled by franchisee or surety without thirty (30) days written
notice, by certified mail, to the City of Berea. Such termination or
cancellation shall have no effect on any liability incurred or accrued under
this bond prior to the effective date of such termination or cancellation."
      (6)   Immediately upon the effective date of the resolution granting a
franchise under this chapter, franchisee shall file with the city the following
proof of liability insurance issued by a company(ies) authorized to do business
in the Commonwealth with an AM Best Rating of A- or better:
         (a)   General Liability Insurance, via an occurrence form, covering
bodily injury, including death, personal injury and property damage, and
including completed operations, contractual liability, independent contractors
protective liability and personal injury liability protection. The minimum
acceptable limit of liability amount is one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per
occurrence and aggregate under a combined single limit. This policy must
include the city, including its mayor and city council members, as additional
insureds as respects all operations of the insured franchisee. The city
reserves the right to make reasonable increases in the required amount of
insurance coverage herein at any time, subject to §
63.005(A)(2) of this chapter. Nothing herein is intended as a limitation on the
extent of any legal liability of the franchisee.
         (b)   Automobile liability, insuring all owned, non-owned and hired
motor vehicles. The minimum coverage liability limit is one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) combined single limit for any one accident. The limit of
liability may be subject to increase according to any applicable state or
federal transportation regulations. This policy must include the city,
including its mayor and city council members, as additional insureds as
respects all operations of the insured franchisee.
         (c)   Workers' Compensation (if applicable), insuring the employers'
obligations under KRS Chapter 342 at statutory limits.
      (7)   Franchisee shall maintain on file with the city a certificate of
insurance certifying the coverage required under this chapter, which
certificate shall be subject to the approval of the city as to the adequacy of
the certificate and of the insurance certified under the requirements of this
chapter. It is agreed that insurers that meet the A.M. Best Supplier rating of
A-VII shall be deemed acceptable by the city. Such certificate shall be
identified on its face by the name of franchisee, and shall be submitted to the
city, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this chapter. Failure to
maintain adequate insurance as required under this chapter shall be deemed a
breach of the franchise.
      (8)   The city reserves the right to make increases in the amount of
insurance coverage referred to in this section at any time, subject to §
63.005(A)(2).
   (G)   Permits. Prior to performing any construction or installation work in
the public rights-of-way, franchisee shall apply to the city for any necessary
permit, and shall include descriptive information about the specific location
of any lines, facilities, boxes, or related equipment. All terms and conditions
of the permit application shall apply and be adhered to.
      (1)   Franchisee shall furnish detailed plans of the work to be done
within the rights- of-way and provide other such information as required by the
city. Franchisee will provide the city with a detailed construction plan on
which the parties will agree ahead of any work, so that it can proceed
immediately with the build.
      (2)   Franchisee shall coordinate any construction work within the
rights-of-way with the city and shall begin construction work only after
approval of the city.
      (3)   All permits issued by the city shall be conspicuously displayed at
all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by
city personnel.
   (H)   Notification. Franchisee shall notify the city, in writing, at least
fifteen (15) days prior to construction. Such written notification shall
contain the location of the construction, the starting date and the estimated
completion date.
   (I)   Standards. Any work required or performed pursuant to this chapter
shall be done in accordance with federal, state and local law, and the National
Electric Safety Code.
      (1)   In the event that franchisee leases space on the poles or in the
conduits of an electric or other utility, franchisee shall abide by the
construction and other requirements of that utility, and the granting of a
franchise by the city shall not be construed or interpreted in any way to
alleviate franchisee's responsibilities and obligations to the pole or conduit
owner.
      (2)   Franchisee, its contractors, sub-subcontractors and anyone directly
or indirectly employed by franchisee shall conduct such operations so as to
promote and preserve the public safety and general welfare of the citizens of
the city.
      (3)   All construction, installation or maintenance by franchisee shall
be completed with diligence and with respect to all interests and rights of the
public.
   (J)   Traffic. Franchisee's work in the rights-of-way shall be accomplished
with a minimum of disruption and interference to the free flow of vehicular and
pedestrian traffic on the rights-of-way or public land.
      (1)   Franchisee shall maintain lanes of vehicular traffic in each
direction at all times during construction, installation or maintenance
activity.
      (2)   Traffic control devices to protect and control pedestrian and
vehicular traffic in any construction, maintenance or installation areas may be
prescribed by the city in accordance with the manual on uniform traffic control
devices.
   (K)   Delay. Improvements to city rights-of-way conducted by the city or its
contractors shall not be delayed by any franchisee work authorized by this
chapter.
   (L)   Special exceptions. The city may grant a special exception to the
requirements of this chapter if a franchisee, upon application, demonstrates
with written evidence that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare;
      (2)   The increased economic burden and the potential adverse impact on
franchisee's construction schedule resulting from the strict enforcement of the
requirement would actually or effectively prohibit the ability of franchisee to
provide communications service in the city; and
      (3)   The requirement unreasonably discriminates against franchisee in
favor of another comparable communications service provider.
      (4)   Any special exceptions shall be granted in a non-discriminatory
manner.
   (M)   Inspections. All construction, installation and operation of
franchisee's system in the rights-of-way are subject to inspection by the city.
   (N)   Repair of sunken pavement over excavation. In case the pavement or the
surface of the rights-of-way over any excavation should become depressed or
broken at any time within five (5) years after the excavation has been
completed and before resurfacing of the rights-of-way, natural wear of the
surface excepted, franchisee shall, upon written notice from the city,
immediately proceed to inspect the depressed or broken area over the excavation
to ascertain the cause of the failure. Franchisee shall make repairs to the
installation or backfill and have the pavement restored as specified by the
city, within such time period as may be specified by the city. If the pavement
is not restored as specified by the city within the time period specified by
the city, and unless delayed by a strike or conditions beyond franchisee's
control, the city may cause the work to be done after giving franchisee twenty-
four (24) hours final notice. The cost thereof, including, but not limited to,
any inspection costs and administrative overhead incurred by the city, shall be
assessed against franchisee.
   (O)   In the event that the use of any part of the system is discontinued
for any reason by any franchisee for a continuous period of twelve (12) months,
or in the event such system or facility has been installed in rights-of-way
without complying with requirements of this chapter, or the rights granted
hereunder have been terminated, cancelled or have expired, the franchisee shall
promptly remove from the rights-of-way all such facilities of such system,
other than any which the city may permit to be abandoned in place. In the event
of such removal, the franchisee shall promptly restore the rights-of-way from
which such facilities have been removed to a condition satisfactory to the
city. Any facilities of a franchisee to be abandoned in place, shall be
abandoned in such manner as the city may prescribe. Upon a permanent
abandonment of the facilities of a franchisee in place, the franchisee shall
submit to the city an instrument to be approved by the city, transferring to
the city the ownership of such facilities.
   (P)   During any phase of construction, installation, maintenance, or repair
of the system, the franchisee shall use materials of good and durable quality.
All such work shall be performed in a safe, thorough and reliable manner and in
compliance with city ordinance and regulations, as amended.
(Ord. No. 04-2021, § 1, 3-2-21)
§ 63.004 MISCELLANEOUS
   (A)   Administration of franchise. The city shall be responsible for the
continued administration of this chapter and any franchises granted hereunder.
   (B)   Non-enforcement by the city. A franchisee shall not be relieved of its
obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or its
applicable franchise by reason of any failure of the city to enforce prompt
compliance.
   (C)   Publication of notices. A franchisee shall be responsible for all
costs of publication that may be required with respect to its franchise or any
amendments or renewals thereto.
   (D)   Severability. If any material provision of this chapter or of any
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter is held by a court or other
competent governmental authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unlawful as conflicting with applicable laws now or hereafter in effect, or is
held by a court or competent governmental authority to be modified in any way
in order to conform to the requirements of any such applicable laws, such
provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of
this chapter or the franchise, and, to the extent possible, such holding shall
not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions herein or
therein.
(Ord. No. 04-2021, § 1, 3-2-21)
§ 63.005 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
   (A)   Existing franchises.
      (1)   Franchises previously granted shall be deemed to continue through
their current expiration date, incorporating this amended chapter, and they
shall be automatically deemed to have complied with all application and
qualification requirements hereunder, unless, within sixty (60) days of passage
of this amended chapter, a franchisee indicates in writing it does not accept
this amended chapter as part of its franchise. Upon such notice of non-
acceptance, said franchisee and the city may renegotiate or terminate the
franchisee's franchise pursuant to all local, state and federal law.
      (2)   Further amendments of the chapter shall be deemed accepted by a
franchisee unless, within sixty (60) days of any further amendments, a
franchisee, indicates in writing it does not accept the amendments as part of
its franchise. Upon such notice of non-acceptance, said franchisee and the city
may renegotiate or terminate the franchisee's franchise pursuant to all local,
state and federal law.
   (B)   Transitional provisions to be narrowly interpreted. It is the intent
of the city to apply the provisions of this chapter to all owners or operators
of communications systems with facilities, including local exchange carriers,
that now occupy or may in the future occupy rights-of-way, except to the extent
federal or state law prevents the city from doing so.
(Ord. No. 04-2021, § 1, 3-2-21)
§ 63.006 FRANCHISEES PROVIDING COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS

emergency alert system specially applicable to their communications services.
   (B)   Provide to every customer access to public, educational and government

   (D)   Employ an operator or maintain a telephone answering device twenty-
four (24) hours per day, each day of the year to receive customer complaints.

such termination at franchisee's expense and advise customers of this option
when customers inquire about returning equipment. These expenses do not include
the cost for use of the equipment before termination of the communications
services.
   (F)   Shall indemnify the city, pursuant to §
63.001(F), against any alleged infringement of patent or copyright or any other
legal infringement arising from franchisee's transmission of materials through
the system, except to the extent any infringement arises from or is caused by
the city's or another person's use of the system, including for any public,
educational, and government access channels. Nothing herein is intended as a
limitation on the extent of any legal liability of the franchisee.
(Ord. No. 04-2021, § 1, 3-2-21)
§ 63.007 PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
   (A)   Application for license. A person wishing to erect, install, maintain,
operate, repair, replace, remove or restore a private communications system in
the rights-of-way must obtain a license therefore from the city. Such license
shall only authorize placement of the private communications system in a
specific portion of the rights-of-way for a limited period of time and for a
specific purpose in connection with the person's business and shall not permit
the use of the private communications system to provide communications service
to any other person or to the public. Such person shall submit an application
to the city on such form as may be developed by the city, accompanied by such
application fee as may be determined by the city.
   (B)   Conditions of license. Any license shall be subject to such conditions
as the city may from time to time establish, shall be expressly subordinate to
the use of the rights-of-way by the city and franchisees, and shall otherwise
conform to the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Compensation. A private communications system owner shall pay a fee
established by the city from time to time to reflect the fair market value of
the rights-of-way used.
(Ord. No. 04-2021, § 1, 3-2-21)
§ 63.008 LIABILITIES AND PENALTIES
   Except as expressly stated in this chapter, the express or implied repeal or
amendment by this chapter of any ordinance or part thereof shall not affect any
liabilities accrued, penalties incurred or proceedings begun prior to the
effective date of this chapter. Those liabilities and penalties are continued,
and penalties shall be imposed and enforced under the repealed or amended
ordinance as if this chapter had not been adopted.
(Ord. No. 04-2021, § 1, 3-2-21)
§ 63.009 REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE
   The rights and remedies of the city and the franchisee as set forth in their
franchise, or in this chapter, shall be in addition to and not in limitation
of, any other rights and remedies provided by law or in equity.

§ 63.010 REVIEW, TERMINATION, AND CANCELLATION
   (A)   To provide for technological changes in the state of the art of
communications services, to facilitate renewal procedures, and to achieve
continuing, advanced, modern systems for the city, the franchisee shall comply
with the following review provisions:
      (1)   The city may hold review sessions which shall be open to the public
and notice shall be given by advertisement in a newspaper of general
circulation at least one week before each session.
      (2)   Either the city or the franchisee may select additional topics for
discussion at any regular or special review session.
      (3)   Any topic proposed for discussion at any regular or special review
session by a resident of the city and supported by a petition bearing the
signature of thirty (30) city residents shall be included in the list of topics
for discussion.
   (B)   Termination.
      (1)   The city may terminate any franchise in accordance herewith in the
event of the violation of any material provision hereof or of any rule or
regulation promulgated pursuant here to or of any applicable federal, state, or
local law, or the breach or other failure, refusal or neglect by the franchisee
to perform its obligations under the material terms and conditions of the
ordinance or of any ordinance or agreement awarding a franchise in accordance
herewith, except when such violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect is
caused by any of the following:
         (a)   Act of God;
         (b)   Riot, insurrection, civil disturbance, sabotage or vandalism,
tampering or interference, act of public enemy, accident, fire, flood,
earthquake, hurricane, tornado, pandemic or outbreak of disease, strike,
unavailability of materials or equipment, war or act or war, all of which are
beyond the control of the franchisee; or
         (c)   An emergency declared by the President of the United States of
America, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or the mayor.
      (2)   In the event that the city determines that the franchisee has
violated any material provision of this chapter, any rule or regulation
promulgated pursuant hereto, any applicable federal, state or local law, or any
material term of an agreement or ordinance awarding a franchise, the city shall
make a written demand on the franchisee that it comply with the law or said
agreement or ordinance. The written demand shall set forth the exact nature of
the noncompliance. The franchisee shall have sixty (60) days from such notice
to either object in writing and to state its reasons for such objections and
provide any explanation or to cure the alleged noncompliance. If the city has
not received a satisfactory response from franchisee, or the violation, breach,
failure, refusal or neglect is not remedied to the satisfaction of the city
within sixty (60) days following such demand, the city shall determine whether
or not, in its sole discretion, any violation, breach, failure, refusal, or
neglect by the franchisee was excusable or inexcusable as provided in §
63.010(B)(1).
         (a)   If the city determines such violation, breach, failure, refusal
or neglect by the franchisee was excusable as provided in §
63.010(B)(1), the city shall direct the franchisee to correct or remedy the
same within such additional time, in such manner and upon such terms and
conditions as are just and reasonable and as the city may direct.
         (b)   If the city determines such violation, breach, failure, refusal,
or neglect by the franchisee was inexcusable, then city council, by ordinance,
may seek to revoke the franchisee's franchise at a public hearing, and the city
council may provide a time period for the franchisee to become compliant. If
the city seeks to revoke franchisee's franchise, it shall provide franchisee
with at least twenty (20) days written notice prior to conducting a hearing.
The hearing shall be on the record and transcribed, if franchisee so elects and
at franchisee's cost, and shall provide franchisee full due process rights,
including the right to state its position on the matter, present evidence, and
question witnesses. Franchisee may appeal any decision made by the city after
the hearing to an appropriate court. Nothing in this chapter, including the
provisions set forth in this §
63.010, shall prevent franchisee from filing at any time a legal action in any
permissible court or tribunal seeking a declaration or enforcement of
franchisee's rights or obligations under the franchise, this chapter, or
applicable law. The franchisee may continue to operate the system until all
avenues and procedures of judicial review have been fully and finally
exhausted.
      (3)   If the city declares the said agreement breached pursuant to §
63.010(B)(2)(b), and the franchisee either does not challenge the city's
decision or city's decision is affirmed in a final, non-appealable court order,
the city may pursue any remedies available to it pursuant to this chapter or to
the said franchise or ordinance or any other remedy, legal or equitable,
available to the city.
   (C)   In the event that the franchise is terminated, the franchisee shall
follow the procedure in §
63.003(O).

discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person
aggrieved") may file a complaint with the chief executive officer. Complaints
shall be in writing and shall contain the information and be in the form as the
chief executive officer requires. Upon receipt of the a complaint, the chief
executive officer shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or person who

practice. Within thirty (30) days after receiving a complaint, or within thirty
(30) days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c),
the chief executive officer shall investigate the complaint and give notice in
writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it. If the chief
executive officer decides to resolve the complaints, he shall proceed to try to
eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal
methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Nothing said or done in
the course of the informal endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in
a subsequent proceeding under this article without the written consent of the
persons concerned. Any employee of the chief executive officer who shall make
public any information in violation of this provision shall be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than five
hundred ($500.00) dollars or imprisoned not more than one (1) year.
   (B)   A complaint under subsection (A) shall be filed within one hundred and
eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred.
Complaints shall be in writing and shall state the facts upon which the
allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be
reasonably and fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to
the complaint against him and with the leave of the chief executive officer,
which shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may
amend his answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If within thirty (30) days after a complaint is filed with the chief
executive officer, the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain
voluntary compliance with this article, the person aggrieved may, within thirty
(30) days thereafter, file a complaint with the secretary of the department of
housing and urban development. The chief executive officer will assist in this
filing.
   (D)   If the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance within thirty (30) days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may,
within thirty (30) days hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate
court, against the respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights
granted or protected by this article, insofar as the rights relate to the
subject of the complaint. If the court finds that a discriminatory housing
practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent

provided, however, that the chief executive officer first complies with the
provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and
seizures. The chief executive officer may issue subpoenas to compel his access
to or the production of the materials, or the appearance of the persons, and
may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to
the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were
issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States district court
for the district in which the investigation is taking place. The chief
executive officer may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the chief executive officer, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the name of the chief executive officer to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued by the chief executive officer himself.
Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their face the
name and address of the respondent and shall state that they were issued at his
request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the chief executive officer shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in United States district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him.
   (D)   Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the
person may petition the chief executive officer to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The chief executive officer shall grant the petition if he finds that
the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or
place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any
matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly
onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the chief
executive officer or other person at whose request it was issued may petition
for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which
the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts
business.
   (F)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence,
if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the
chief executive officer shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
fined not more than five hundred ($500) dollars or imprisoned no more than one
(1) year, or both. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the chief
executive officer, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement
of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted to the
chief executive officer pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or shall
willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true and correct
entries in the reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or shall
willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary
evidence, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more
five hundred ($500) dollars or imprisoned for not more than one (1) year, or
both.

chief executive officer participates as part or as amicus pursuant to this

(180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred;
provided, however, that the court shall continue the civil case brought
pursuant to this section or §
70.409(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the chief executive officer are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice
complained or in the complaint made to the chief executive officer and which
practice forms the basis for the action in court; and provided, however, that
any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court
order issued under the authority of this article, and involving a bona fide
purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of
the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this article
shall not be affected.

or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than one thousand
($1,000.00) dollars punitive damages, together with court costs and reasonable
attorney fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 75.001 AUTHORITY
   The legislature of the state of Kentucky has, in KRS 100, delegated to local
governmental units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
city council hereby adopts floodplain management regulations, as follows:
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damage.
(Ord. No. 23-88, 9-30-88; Amd. Ord. 13-95, passed 6-26-95; Amd. Ord. 13-2012,
passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.002 PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in
such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
      (7)   To insure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is
in a special flood hazard area; and
      (8)   To insure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. No. 23-88, 9-30-88; Amd. Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-21-12)

effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by a
community.
   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK” or “SUBDIVISION.”  The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing

any source.
   (C)   Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a
river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as
when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
   (D)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding.
   “FLOOD BOUNDARY and FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).” A map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards
and the regulatory floodway.
   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).” A map on which the boundaries of the

open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   “FLOOD PROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation
facilities, structures, and their contents.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, the FEMA form in effect at the time of certification
stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant utilities and

that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all structural
components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces,
including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact forces.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.
Also referred to as the "regulatory floodway".
   “FLOODWAY FRINGE.” That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway.
   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in §
75.018, Appeals and Variance Procedures, of this chapter, means that the
variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In
examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every
newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a
part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Structures
that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject
during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future
owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the
costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages
may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that
it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high
flood insurance rates.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.” A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or

shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “GOVERNING BODY.” The local governing unit (i.e., county or municipality)
that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.” The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:
   (A)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a

by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
   (B)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district.

with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of the interior; or
   (D)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
      (1)   By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the
interior, or
      (2)   Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without
approved programs.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).” Increased cost of compliance coverage
means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a
substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and
that is required to bring a substantially damaged building into compliance with
the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
floodproofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any
combination thereof. ICC coverage is available on residential and non-
residential buildings (this category includes public or government buildings,
such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   “LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's include the following
categories:
   (A)   “LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).” A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was inadvertently included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA
amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a SFHA.
   (B)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).” A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
   (C)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION - BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F).” A determination
that a structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill
above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA.
   “LEVEE.” A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   “LEVEE SYSTEM.” A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   “LIMITED STORAGE.” An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   “LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The lowest elevation of the sidewalk, patio,
attached garage, deck support, basement entryway or grade immediately next to
the structure and after the completion of construction.
   “LOWEST FLOOR.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   “MANUFACTURED HOME.” A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or
without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required
utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar
transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. The term
“manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle" (see Recreational
Vehicle).

(FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   “MAP PANEL NUMBER.” The four (4) digit number on a flood map, followed by a
letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel.
The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter "A" is not used by FEMA, the letter "B" is the first
revision.)
   “MARKET VALUE.” The property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and
seller), excluding the value of the land as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. Market value of the structure can be established by
independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of
structure (Actual Cash Value) or adjusted assessed values.
   “MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).” The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on the community's FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988.
   “MITIGATION.” Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
costs of disaster response and recovery.
   “MUDSLIDE or MUDFLOW.” Describes a condition where there is a river, flow,
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e., mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the floodplain administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   “MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT.” The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   “MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA.” An area with land surfaces and slopes
of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   “NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP).” The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   “NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD).” As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRM'S. Refer to
FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   “NEW CONSTRUCTION.” Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by
a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   “NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK” or “SUBDIVISION.” A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   “NON-RESIDENTIAL.” Structures that are not designed for human habitation,
including but not limited to: small business concerns, churches, schools, farm
structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses,
recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial
structures, warehouses, and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less
than six (6) months duration.
   “NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD).” As corrected in 1988, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRM's and Digitally Referenced FIRM's
(DFIRM's). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM panel legend for correct datum.)
   “OBSTRUCTION.” Includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   “ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD)” (see “Base Flood”). The flood that
has a one-percent (1%) or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to

adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1)
foot. See Base Flood.
   “REMEDY A VIOLATION.” The process by which a community brings a structure or
other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management
regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impact of non-
compliance. Reduced impact may include protecting the structure or other
affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement
provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations,
or reducing state or federal financing exposure with regard to the structure or
other development.
   “REPAIR.” The reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing
structure.
   “REPETITIVE LOSS.” Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)

other improvement of a structure, taking place during a one (1)-year period in
which the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds fifty (50)
percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   (A)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or

ARTICLE II. ADMINISTRATION
§ 75.015 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR
   The city council hereby appoints the codes enforcement officer to
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting
or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein
referred to as the floodplain administrator.
(Ord. No. 23-88, 9-30-88; Amd. Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.016 PERMIT PROCEDURES
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
75.005. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by the floodplain administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of the floodplain
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required:
   (A)   Application Stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §
75.026(B) and §
75.029(B);
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction Stage. Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before
construction continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it
shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain
administrator and to the state a certification of the elevation of the lowest
floor or flood-proofed elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In
AE, Al-30, AH, and A zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base
flood elevation, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same. When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure,
said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The floodplain administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

§ 75.017 DUTIES; RESPONSIBILITIES OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR
   (A)   The floodplain administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed,
authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of
this chapter. The floodplain administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this chapter, which are consistent with its spirit and
purpose by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its
provisions.
   (B)   The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall
include, but not be limited to the following:

Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C 1334.;
         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner;
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely
affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and Use of Any Other Base Flood Data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
75.005, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
75.025 et seq. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for
adoption.
      (3)   Notification of Other Agencies.

any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse, and
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA); and
         (c)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      (4)   Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
         (a)   Certification required by §
75.026(A) (lowest floor elevations) as shown on an accurately completed and
certified elevation certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
and substantially improved structures, in accordance with §
75.016(B);
         (b)   Certification required by §
75.026(B) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown on
an accurately completed and certified FEMA floodproofing certificate. Verify
and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the
new and substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed, in
accordance with §
75.016(B);
         (c)   Certification required by §
75.026(C) (elevated structures);
         (d)   Certification of elevation required by §
75.028(A) (subdivision standards);
         (e)   Certification required by §
75.026(E) (floodway encroachments);
         (f)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
maintained;
         (g)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance; and
         (h)   Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this
chapter as specified in §
75.098.

exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
75.018(C)(1);
         (b)   When base flood elevation data and floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
75.005, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
75.025 et seq.;
         (c)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
floodplain administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
75.026(B) a floodproofing certificate;
         (d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall
be maintained in the office of the floodplain administrator and shall be open
for public inspection.
      (6)   Right of Entry.
         (a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the floodplain administrator has
reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any
premises any condition or ordinance violation which makes such building,
structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the floodplain
administrator may enter such building, structure or premises at all reasonable
times to inspect the same or perform any duty imposed upon the floodplain
administrator by this chapter.
         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, the floodplain
administrator shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such
building, structure, or premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a
reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control
of such request entry.
         (c)   If entry is refused, the floodplain administrator may seek, in a
court of competent jurisdiction, an order allowing access for the purpose of
enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
         (d)   When the floodplain administrator shall have first obtained a
proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no
owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any
building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is
made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the floodplain
administrator for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this
chapter.
      (7)   Stop Work Orders. Upon notice from the floodplain administrator,
work on any building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the
provisions of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in
writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to
the person performing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work
may be resumed.
      (8)   Revocation of Permits.
         (a)   The floodplain administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based.
         (b)   The floodplain administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this chapter.
      (9)   Liability. No officer, employee, or member of the floodplain
administrator's staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties, shall
thereby be personally liable, and is hereby relieved from all personal
liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of
any act required or permitted in the discharge of his or her duties. Any suit
brought against any officer, employee, or member because of such act performed
by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this chapter shall be
defended by the Berea Corporation counsel.
      (10)   Expiration of Floodplain Construction Permit. A floodplain
development permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
"start of construction" has not occurred within one hundred and eighty (180)
calendar days from the date of its issuance.
(Ord. No. 23-88, 9-30-88; Amd. Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.018 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
   (A)   Nature of Variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The duties of the variance
and appeal board shall be exercised by the code enforcement board.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The variance and appeal board shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the variance and appeal
board may appeal such decision to the Madison Circuit Court within thirty (30)
days of the final decision appealed from.
   (D)   Variance Procedures. In passing upon such applications, the variance
and appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
existing or proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent use;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
   (E)   Conditions for Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the variance and appeal board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the variance and appeal board may grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the variance and
appeal board believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of
the local chapter.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
75.003 under "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in §
75.003) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
      (5)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
      (6)    Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §
75.018(D) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance Notification.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25) for one hundred dollars ($100)
of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain
administrator in the Office of the Berea Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and
report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic Structures.  Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition in § 75.003) upon
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.

(Ord. No. 23-88, 9-30-88; Amd. Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.026 SPECIFIC STANDARDS
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
75.005, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall
be provided in accordance with standards of §
75.026(C).
      (1)   In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified
in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest
adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the floodplain administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than two (2) feet
above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative
Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the
technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: The applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby base
flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot Cross
sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated two (2) feet above the base flood
elevation.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer
or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection department to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
floodplain administrator.
   (B)   Non-Residential Construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with §
75.026(A) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed to an elevation two (2) feet above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification along with
the design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the
floodplain administrator.
      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in §
75.026(D).
      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an
elevation two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this
requirement must meet or exceed the standards of §
75.026(C).
   (C)   Elevated Structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed
on sites located within A, Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
            (i)   On individual lots or parcels;
            (ii)   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            (iii)   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions or
            (iv)   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            (v)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
            (vi)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a
site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the
result of a flood.
         (b)   All such manufactured homes must be:
            (i)   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and
            (ii)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than two (2) feet
above the level of the base flood elevation; and
            (iii)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
so that either:
            (i)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no
lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, or
            (ii)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no
less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            (i)   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days,
            (ii)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
            (iii)   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for "manufactured
homes".
         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
75.005, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall
apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If §
75.026(E) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and
other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
75.025 et seq.
(Ord. No. 23-88, 9-30-88; Amd. Ord. No. 13-95, 6-26-95; Amd. Ord. 13-2012,
passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.027 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS AND/OR
FLOODWAYS
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
75.005, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
75.005.
(Ord. No. 23-88, 9-30-88; Amd. Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.028 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the
elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage.
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to

certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
floodplain administrator.
(Ord. No. 23-88, 9-30-88; Amd. Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.029 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
75.005, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the flood insurance rate map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of substantial of
non-residential structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above

elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one (1) foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
75.026(B).
(Ord. No. 23-88, 9-30-88; Amd. Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.030   STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE
LETTER ‘A’
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated 'A'
the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Must be non-habitable;

located outside the limits of the SFHA (one hundred (100)-year floodplain).
Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the
floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated one (1) foot or more above the base flood
elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.098   ENFORCEMENT; VIOLATION NOTICE
   (A)   Civil Offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain development permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of Violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the floodplain administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the floodplain administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of Citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the floodplain administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the floodplain administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven (7) days of the date the
citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the code enforcement board. If the person to whom
the citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven (7) days,
that person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
(Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-21-12)
§ 75.099 PENALTY
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned for not more
than thirty (30) days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and

include building columns, landscaping, statuary and fountains. “ARCADES” do not
include off-street loading/unloading areas, driveways or parking areas.
   “ARTICULATE.” To give emphasis to or distinctly identify a particular
element. An articulated facade would be the emphasis of elements on the face of
a wall including a change in setback, materials, roof pitch or height.
   “AS-OF-RIGHT ZONING.” Uses and development standards that are determined in
advance and specifically authorized by the zoning regulations (for example, a
single-family zone would allow single- family housing as-of-right so long as
site development standards are met). This type of zoning is in contrast to
cumulative or pyramidal zoning.
   “BERM.” An earthen mound designed to provide visual interest on a site,
screen undesirable views, reduce noise or provide a buffer from adjoining uses.
   “BREEZEWAY.” A structure for the principal purpose of connecting a main
building or structure on a property with other buildings.
   “BUFFER.” See also “SCREEN.” An area provided to reduce the conflict between
two different land uses. “BUFFERS” are intended to mitigate undesired views,
noise and glare, effectively providing greater privacy to neighboring land
uses. Typical buffers consist of materials that serve this purpose and include,
but are not limited to, plant materials, walls, fences and/or significant land
area to separate the uses.
   “BUFFER STRIP.” A portion of a lot or property used to visually separate one
use from another through the use of vegetation, distance, or other approved
method.
   “BUILDING FACE, FRONT.” Any building face which can be touched by a line
drawn perpendicular to street (public or private).
   “BUILDING FACE, PUBLIC.” Any building side which is visible from public or
private rights-of-way and/or the faces that contain public entry.
   “BUILDING MASS.” The building’s expanse or bulk and is typically used in
reference to structures of considerable size.
   “DESIGN GUIDELINES.” Statements and graphics intended to direct the planning
and development of the built environment in a particular manner or style so
that the end result contributes positively to the overall development.
   “DORMER.” A window set vertically in a gable projecting from a sloping roof.
   “FACADE.” The portion of any exterior elevation on the building extending
from grade to the top of the parapet, wall or eaves, and extending the entire
length of the building.
   “FRONT YARD.” The portion of the front yard extending the full width of the
lot and measured between the front lot line and a parallel line across the
front of the building. Corner and double lots shall adhere to the front yard
setback(s) for each frontage.
   “GABLE.” A triangular wall section at the end of a pitched roof, bounded by
the two (2) roof slopes.
   “HIP ROOF.” Roof without gables.
   “PARAPET.” The portion fo a wall that extends above the roofline.
   “PEDESTRIAN ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.” Development designed with an emphasis
primarily on the street sidewalk and on pedestrian access to the site and
buildings/structures rather than on auto access. The buildings/structures are
generally located close to the public or private right-of-way and the main
entrance is oriented to the street sidewalk. There are generally windows or
display cases along building facades. Although parking is provided, it is
generally limited in size and location.
   “PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY.” A surfaced walkway, separate from the traveled portion
of a public or private right-of-way or parking lot/driving aisle.
   “PORTICO.” A porch or walkway with a roof supported by columns, often
leading to the entrance of a building.
   “PUBLIC/PRIVATE RIGHT-OF-WAY.” Any public or private road, or access
easement, intended to provide public access to any lot/development, but
excluding any service road or internal driving aisles (for example, within
parking lots).
   “SCREEN.” See also “BUFFER.” The sole purpose of a “SCREEN” is to block
views. A “SCREEN” should be constructed of opaque materials and whose height
will be effective in obstructing unwanted views.
   “SETBACK.” A prescribed distance or an area between one (1) element and
another (for example, a building and the road right-of-way). Within these
guidelines, the term also refers to:
      (1)   The minimum distance and the area measured from the property line
to the interior of a parcel where buildings may be constructed.
      (2)   The required distance and the area between the edge of the parking
lot pavement/curb and the property line or buildings/structures.
      (3)   Placing a building face on a line to the rear of another building
line.
   “STREETSCAPE.” All elements of a development or area that are in view from
other points along a street.
(Ord. No. 13-02, § 1, 6-3-03)
§ 81.103 DESIGN GUIDELINES
   (A)   Aesthetic character.
      (1)   Facades and exterior walls.
         (a)   Intent. Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive
scale and the uniform, impersonal appearances of large retain buildings and
provide visual interest that will be more consistent with the community’s
identity, character and scale. The intent is to encourage a more human scale
that residents of Berea-Madison County will be able to identify with their
community. The resulting scale will ensure a greater likelihood for reuse of
structure by subsequent tenants.
         (b)   Guideline. Developments with facade over one hundred (100) feet
in linear length shall incorporate wall projections or recesses a minimum of
three (3) feet depth and a minimum of twenty (20) contiguous feet within each
one hundred (100) feet of facade length and shall extend over twenty (20)
percent of the facade. Developments shall use animating features such as
arcades, display windows, entry areas, or awnings along at least sixty (60)
percent of the facade.
      (2)   Smaller retail stores.
         (a)   Intent. The presence of smaller retail stores gives a center a
“friendlier” appearance by creating variety, breaking up large expanses, and
expanding the range of the site’s activities. Windows and window displays of
such stores should be used to contribute to the visual interest of exterior
facades. The standards presented in this article are directed toward those
situations where additional, smaller stores, with separate, exterior customer
entrances are located in the principal buildings or development site.
         (b)   Guideline. Where principal buildings contain additional,
separately owned stores, which occupy less than forty thousand (40,000) square
feet of gross floor area, with separate, exterior customer entrances:
            1.   The street level facade of such stores shall be transparent
between the height of three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above the walkway grade
for no less than sixty (60) percent of the horizontal length of the building
facade of such additional stores.
            2.   Windows shall be recessed and should include visually
prominent sills, shutters, or other such forms of framing.
      (3)   Detail features.
         (a)   Intent. Buildings should have architectural features and
patterns that provide visual interest, at the scale of the pedestrian, reduce
massive aesthetic effects, and recognize local character. The elements in the
following standard should be integral parts of the building fabric, and not
superficially applied trim or graphics, or paint.
         (b)   Guideline. Building facades shall include a repeating pattern
that shall include no less than three (3) of the elements listed below. At
least one (1) of these elements shall repeat horizontally. All elements shall
repeat at intervals of no more than thirty (30) feet, either horizontally or
vertically.
            1.   Color change.
            2.   Texture change.
            3.   Material module change.
            4.   Expression of architectural or structural bay through a change
in plane no less than twelve (12) inches in width, such as an offset, reveal,
or projecting rib.
      (4)   Roofs.
         (a)   Intent. Variations in roof lines should be used to add interest
to, and reduce the massive scale of large buildings. Roof features should
complement the character of adjoining neighborhoods.
         (b)   Guideline. Roof lines, or the facade above a flat roof, shall be
varied with a change in height every one hundred (100) linear feet in the
building length. Parapets, mansard roofs, gable roofs, hip roofs, or dormers
shall be used to conceal flat roofs and rooftop equipment from public view.
Alternative lengths and designs may be acceptable and can be addressed during
the preliminary development plan.
      (5)   Materials and colors.
         (a)   Intent. Exterior building materials and colors comprise a
significant part of the visual impact of a building. Therefore, they should be
aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and colors used in
adjoining neighborhoods.
         (b)   Guideline.
            1.   Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality
materials. These include, without limitation:
               A.   Brick.
               B.   Wood.
               C.   Sandstone.
               D.   Other native stone.
               E.   Tinted, textured, concrete masonry units.
            2.   Facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral, or
earth tone colors. The use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, black or
fluorescent colors is prohibited.
            3.   Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors,
including primary colors, but neon tubing shall not be an acceptable feature
for building trim or accent areas.
            4.   Predominant exterior building materials as well as accents
should not include the following:
               A.   Smooth-faced concrete block.
               B.   Tilt-up concrete panels.
               C.   Pre-fabricated steel panels.
      (6)   Entryways.
         (a)   Intent. Entryway design elements and variations should give
orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the building. The standards
identify desirable entryway design features.
         (b)   Guideline. Each principal building on a site shall have clearly
defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring no less than three (3) of
the following:
            1.   Canopies or porticos.
            2.   Overhangs.
            3.   Recesses/projections.
            4.   Arcades.
            5.   Raised corniced parapets over the door.
            6.   Peaked roof forms.
            7.   Arches.
            8.   Outdoor patios.
            9.   Display windows.
            10.   Architectural details such as tile work and moldings which
are integrated into the building structure and design.
            11.   Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped
areas and/or places for sitting.
      (7)   Interior design and utilities.
         (a)   Intent. Interior design should provide for ease of division of
“big box” buildings into two (2) or more spaces.
         (b)   Guideline. Interior supports and utilities shall be placed to
facilitate division of “big box” buildings into separate retail spaces at
minimal expense.
   (C)   Site design and relationship to the surrounding community.
      (1)   Entrances.
         (a)   1.   Intent. Large retail building should feature multiple
entrances. Multiple building entrances reduce walking distances from cars,
facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access from public sidewalks, and provide
convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual stores, or
identified departments in a store. Multiple entrances also mitigate the effect
of the unbroken walls and neglected areas that often characterize building
facades that face bordering land uses.
            2.   Guideline. All sides of a principal building that directly
face an abutting public or private right-of-way shall feature at least one (1)
customer entrance. Where a principal building directly faces more than two (2)
abutting public or private rights-of-way, this requirement shall apply only to
two (2) sides of the building, including the side of the building facing the
primary street, and another side of the building facing a secondary street.
         (b)   The number of entrances for the principal building shall be
addressed at the preliminary development plan stage. Where additional stores
will be located in the principal building, each such store shall have at least
one (1) exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the above
requirements.
      (2)   Parking lot orientation.
         (a)   Intent. Parking areas should provide safe, convenient, and
efficient access for vehicles and pedestrians. They should be distributed
around large buildings in order to shorten the distance to other buildings and
public sidewalks and to reduce the overall scale of the paved surface. If
buildings are located closer to streets, the scale of the complex is reduced,
pedestrian traffic is encouraged, and architectural details take on added
importance.
         (b)   Guideline. No more than sixty (60) percent of the off-street
parking area for the entire property shall be located within the front yard of
the principal building(s) street unless the principal building(s) and/or
parking lots are screened from view by outlot development (such as restaurants)
and additional tree plantings and/or berms.
      (3)   Back and sides.
         (a)   Intent. The rear or sides of buildings often present an
unattractive view of blank walls, loading areas, storage areas, HVAC units,
garbage receptacles, and other such features. Architectural and landscaping
features should mitigate these impacts. Any back or side of a building visible
from a public or private right-of-way shall be built in accordance with Article
I. The planning commission may waive this requirement as part of the
development plan.
         (b)   Guideline. The minimum setback for any building facade shall be
in accordance with the B-4 requirements (Section 81.___, hereof). Where the
facade faces adjacent residential uses an earthen berm shall be installed, no
less than six (6) feet in height, containing at a minimum, a double row of
evergreen or deciduous trees planted at intervals of fifteen (15) feet on
center. Additional landscaping may be required by the planning commission to
effectively buffer adjacent land use as deemed appropriate. All additional
landscape requirements of the zoning ordinance shall apply.
      (4)   Outdoor storage, trash collection, and loading areas.
         (a)   Intent. Loading areas and outdoor storage areas exert visual and
noise impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. These areas, when visible from
adjoining properties and/or public streets, should be screened, recessed or
enclosed. While screens and recesses can effectively mitigate these impacts,
the selection of inappropriate screening materials can exacerbate the problem.
Appropriate locations for loading and unloading storage areas include areas
between buildings, where more than one (1) building is located on a site and
such buildings are not more than forty (40) feet apart, or on those sides of
buildings that do not have customer entrances.
         (b)   Guideline.
            1.   Areas for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection or
compaction, loading, or other such uses shall not be visible from public or
private rights-of-way.
            2.   No areas for outdoor storage, trash collection or compaction,
loading, or other such uses shall be located within twenty (20) feet of any
public or street, public sidewalk, or internal pedestrian way.
            3.   Loading docks, truck parking, outdoor storage, utility meters,
HVAC equipment, trash dumpsters, trash compaction, and other service functions
shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the
landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are
fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets,
and no attention is attracted to the functions by the use of screening
materials that are different from or inferior to the principal materials of the
building and landscape.
            4.   Non-enclosed areas for the storage and sale of seasonal
inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences.
Materials, colors, and designs of screening walls and/or fences and the cover
shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors of the
building. If such areas are to be covered, then the covering shall conform to
those used as predominant materials and colors on the buildings.
            5.   Temporary sales/displays, such as Christmas trees, landscape
materials, and fireworks shall follow all outdoor requirements for commercial
districts as described in the zoning ordinance. Location and time/duration of
such sales/displays shall be reviewed and approved by the code officer or
appointed designee.
      (5)   Pedestrian flows.
         (a)   Intent. Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented
developments to the neighborhood, thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling
the development to project a friendlier, more inviting image. This section sets
forth standards for public sidewalks and internal pedestrian circulation
systems that can provide user-friendly pedestrian access as well as pedestrian
safety, shelter, and convenience within the center grounds.
         (b)   Guideline.
            1.   Sidewalks at least six (6) feet in width shall be provided
along all sides of the lot that abut a public or private right-of-way. The
planning commission may waive this requirement as part of the development plan.
            2.   Continuous internal pedestrian walkways, no less than five (5)
feet in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to
the principal customer entrance of all principal buildings on the site. At a
minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity, such as,
but not limited to, transit stops, street crossings, building and store entry
points, and shall feature adjoining landscaped areas that include trees,
shrubs, benches, flower beds, ground covers, or other such materials for no
less than fifty (50) percent of their length.
            3.   Sidewalks, no less than five (5) feet in width, shall be
provided along the full length of the building along any facade featuring a
customer entrance, and along any facade abutting public parking areas. Such
sidewalks shall be located at least six (6) feet from the facade of the
building to provide planting beds foundation landscaping, except where features
such as arcades or entryways are part of the facade.
            4.   Internal pedestrian walkways provided in conformance with
division (C)(5)2. above shall provide weather protection features such as
awnings or arcades within thirty (30) feet of all customer entrances,
constructed parallel to the facade of the building. This is not intended to
extend into the driving aisles or parking areas.
            5.   All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from
driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials
such as pavers, bricks, or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and
comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways. Signs shall be
installed to designate pedestrian walkways.
      (6)   Central features and community spaces.
         (a)   Intent. Buildings should offer attractive and inviting
pedestrian scale features, spaces and amenities. Entrances and parking lots
should be configured to be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently
tied to logical destinations. Bus stops and drop-off/pick-up points should be
anchored by special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos,
pedestrian light fixtures, bollards, planter walls, and other architectural
elements that define circulation ways and outdoor spaces. The features and
spaces should enhance the building and the center as integral parts of the
community fabric.
         (b)   Guideline. 
            1.   Each retail establishment subject to these standards shall
contribute to the establishment or enhancement of community and public spaces
by providing at least two (2) of the following: patio/seating area, pedestrian
plaza with benches, transportation center, window shopping walkways, outdoor
play area, kiosk area, water feature, clock tower, steeple, or other such
deliberately shaped area and/or a focal feature or amenity that, in the
judgment of the planning commission, adequately enhances such community and
public spaces. Any such areas shall have direct access to the public sidewalk
network and such features shall not be constructed of materials that are
inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape.
            2.   Areas should be provided or designed to accommodate possible
(future) bus service and the growing number of private bus services.
(Ord. No. 13-02, § 1, 6-3-03; Am. Ord. No. 09-2009, § 1, 6-2-09)
§ 81.104 MODIFICATIONS; VARIANCES; WAIVERS
   (A)   In the event it is determined by the planning commission that
compliance with these design guidelines would result in extraordinary hardship
to a developer proposing a large retail development due to the unusual
topography or conditions beyond the control of the developer, then the planning
commission may modify, vary, or waive the design guidelines, provided that the
modification, variance, or waiver will not nullify the intent of these design
guidelines, and provided further that the modification, variance, or waiver,
and the reason therefor, shall be entered upon the minutes of the planning
commission.
   (B)   Each modification, variance, or waiver of these design standards
sought by a developer shall be specifically applied for in writing.

   (A)   A developer may choose to use an independent impact analysis to
compute the impact fee due as a result of a development, solely at its own
expense.
   (B)   The developer shall be responsible for the preparation of the draft
independent impact analysis and the city may accept, reject, or modify the
draft analysis.
   (C)   The city engineer shall approve the person or company which prepares
the draft independent impact analysis on the basis of the person's or company's
professional training and experience in preparing development impact analysis.
The independent impact analysis shall follow standard methodologies and format
and be approved by the city engineer. The city engineer may publish acceptable
methodologies and formats for impact analysis. Prior to submission of the draft
independent impact analysis, the developer shall meet with the city engineer to
review the requirements for preparing drafting independent impact analysis. In
the event that the city engineer is unable or unwilling to act as set out in
this section, then the city administrator shall act in the place and stead of
the city engineer.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.009 IMPACT FEE ACCOUNTS
   (A)   For each benefit area designated by the city, the city shall establish
an impact fee account for each type of capital improvement for which an impact
fee is imposed. The impact fees collected shall be deposited in each such
account according to type of improvement and benefit area. The funds of the
account shall not be commingled with other funds of the city. Any account
previously established for the deposit of funds which would have been developer
impact fees under this chapter shall be deemed an impact fee account for the
purposes of this chapter.
   (B)   Each impact fee account shall be interest bearing, and the accumulated
interest shall become part of the account.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.010 USE OF IMPACT FEE PROCEEDS
   Impact fees may be expended only for the type of capital improvements for
which they were imposed, calculated, and collected, and according to the time
limits and procedures established in this chapter. Impact fees may be used to
pay the principal, interest, and other costs of bonds, notes, and other
obligations issued or undertake by or on behalf of the city to finance such
improvements.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.011 REFUNDS
   (A)   Upon application of the property owner, the city shall refund that
portion of any impact fee which has been on deposit over five (5) years and
which is unexpended and uncommitted, except as described in subsection (B) of
this section. The refund shall be made to the then-current owner or owners of
lots or units of the development project or projects.
   (B)   If fees in any impact fee account are unexpended or uncommitted during
the fifty year, the fees are exempt from subsection (A) of this section, if the
city council makes the following findings.
      (1)   A need for the capital improvement still exists;
      (2)   The fees will be used for an identified purpose; and
      (3)   The purpose for which the fees will be used is substantially
similar to the purpose for which the fees were collected.
   (C)   The city may refund by direct payment, by offsetting the refund
against other impact fees due for development projects by the owner on the same
or other property, or otherwise by agreement with the owner.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.012 AUDITS
   A developer may request any audit to determine whether the impact fee
imposed exceeds the amount reasonably necessary to finance capital improvements
attributable to the development project.
   The city council shall then retain a qualified, independent auditor who
shall determine whether the fee is appropriate. The city may require as a
condition of the audit that the property owner deposit with the city a sum
equal to the reasonable estimated cost of the audit, and that the property
owner pay for the actual cost of the audit. The decision of the independent
auditor is final unless appealed to the city council by the property owner as
provided by this chapter.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.013 APPEALS
   (A)   Within ten (10) days following mailing of notice of the auditor's
decision to the appellant, a person may challenge the imposition of a fee
imposed pursuant to this chapter by filing with the city clerk a written notice
of appeal with a full statement of the grounds and an appeal fee of two hundred
dollars ($200.00) or such other amount as may be fixed from time to time by the
city council. The city may continue processing the development application if
the notice of appeal is accompanied with a bond or other security in an amount
equal to the impact fee.
   (B)   The appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the amount of the
fee was not calculated according to the procedures established in this chapter.
   (C)   At a regular meeting following the filing of the appeal, the city
council shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and the city clerk
shall mail notice of hearing to the appellant at the address given in the
notice of appeal. The hearing shall be conducted at the time and place stated
in the notice, and the determination of the city council shall be announced at
the conclusion of the hearing or at the next regular meeting of the city
council. The determination of the city council shall be final.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.014 JUDICIAL REVIEW
   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by final action of
the city pursuant to §
82.013 may appeal to the Madison Circuit Court pursuant to the provisions of
KRS 100.347.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.015 VARIANCES AND EXCEPTIONS
   Petitions for variances and exceptions to the application of this chapter
shall be made in accordance with the provisions of KRS 100.243.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.016 AMENDMENT PROCEDURES
   Prior to the city council's adoption of the budget and revisions to the
capital improvements project list, the city administrator, code enforcement
officer and the sewer superintendent, shall jointly report at least once each
year to the city council with:
   (A)   Recommendations for amendments to this chapter;
   (B)   Proposals for changes to the capital improvements project list,
identifying capital improvements to be funded in whole or in part by impact
fees.
   (C)   Proposals for changes in the boundaries of benefit areas; and
   (D)   Proposals for changes to impact fee rates and schedules.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.017 CREDITS
   (A)   A property owner who dedicates land or agrees to participate in an
assessment district or otherwise contributes funds for capital improvements as
defined in this chapter may be eligible for a credit for such contribution
against the impact fee otherwise due.
   (B)   The city engineer shall determine: (1) the value of the developer
contribution; (2) whether the contribution meets capital improvement needs for
which the particular impact fee has been imposed; and (3) whether the
contribution will substitute or otherwise reduce the need for capital
improvements anticipated to be provided with impact fee finds. In no event,
however, shall the credit exceed the amount of the otherwise applicable impact
fee.
   (C)   Any application for credit must be submitted on forms provided by the
city before development project approval. The application shall contain a
declaration under oath of those facts which qualify the property owner for the
credit, accompanied by the relevant documentary evidence.
(Ord. No. 14-2001, 8-15-01)
§ 82.018 CONFLICTS
   In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the
provisions of any other ordinance or resolution establishing or amending impact
fees, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.
