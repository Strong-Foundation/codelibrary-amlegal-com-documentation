   (A)   The City of Walton does hereby adopt an internal grievance procedure
to provide for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any
action prohibited by the Office of Revenue Sharing (ORS) Regulations (31 CFR
51.55)(d)(2) implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
amended (29 U.S.C. 794). Section 504 states, in part, that "No otherwise
qualified individual with a disability shall, solely by reason of his
disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of,
or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal
financial assistance. . ."
   (B)   All complaints alleging a violation of the foregoing section shall be
addressed to the City Clerk/Finance, City Hall, Main Street, Walton, Kentucky,
(859) 485-4383, who is designated by this section to coordinate Section 504
compliance efforts.
   (C)   A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, containing the
name and address of the person filing it and briefly describing the alleged
violation of the regulations.
   (D)   A complaint shall be filed within 30 days after the complainant

discrimination occurring before this grievance procedure was adopted shall be
considered on a case-by-case basis.
   (E)   An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a
complaint. The investigation will be conducted by the Mayor. These rules
contemplate informal but thorough investigations, affording all interested
persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence
relevant to a complaint. Under 31 CFR 51.55(d)(2) the city need not process
complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants for admission to
post secondary educational institutions.
   (F)   A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and a
description of resolution, if any, shall be issued by the Mayor and a copy
forwarded to the complainant not later than 60 days after its filing.

resolution. The request for reconsideration shall be made within 30 days to the
City Clerk/Finance.
   (H)   The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the
complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of
other remedies such as the filing of a Section 504 complaint with the Office of
Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of the Treasury. Utilization of this grievance
procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies.
   (I)   These rules shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of
interested persons, to meet appropriate due-process standards, and to assure
that the city complies with Section 504 in the ORS Regulations.

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 37.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)   (1)   As defined in §
37.01, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
37.12, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a request or complete a written application for such records at the
office of the City Clerk during regular office hours, except during legal
holidays.
      (2)   The written application shall be:
         (a)   Hand delivered;
         (b)   Mailed;
         (c)   Sent via facsimile; or
         (d)   Sent via e-mail to the public agency's official custodian of
public records or his or her designee at the e-mail address designated in the
public agency's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to KRS 61.876.
      (3)   A public agency shall not require the use of any particular form
for the submission of an open records request, but shall accept for any request
the standardized form developed under KRS 61.876(4).
(KRS 61.872 (2))
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person's request is in compliance
with the open records law and the requested records are immediately available,
the custodian shall deliver the records for inspection. Suitable facilities
shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk for the inspection. No
person shall remove original copies of public records from the offices of any
public agency without the written permission of the official custodian of the
record. (KRS 61.872(1))
   (C)   An applicant may inspect public records during the regular business
hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from the city
through the mail if the applicant's residence or principal place of business is
outside of the county in which the city is located and he has precisely
described public records which are available within the city. If the person
requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed, the official
custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of
mailing. KRS 61.872(3)
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
37.01. (KRS 61.874(1))
   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency

than 82 inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(2)(b))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874 (4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874 (5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).
(KRS 61.874(6))
§ 37.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk does not have custody or control of the public record or
records requested, the City Clerk shall so notify the applicant and shall
furnish the name and location of the custodian of the public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 37.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 37.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence. (KRS 61.872(6))
§ 37.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,

PROHIBITIONS AND CONDITIONS.
   The following regulations, prohibitions, and conditions are applicable and
are in force and effect with respect to the combined and consolidated water and
sewer system of the city:
   (A)   All taps and connections to the water mains and sewer of the city
shall be made by and/or under the direction and supervision of the manager.
   (B)   Water service may be discontinued by the city for any violation of any
rule, regulation, or condition of service and especially for any of the
following reasons:
      (1)   Misrepresentation in the application or contract as to the property
or fixtures to be supplied, or as to additional use of water/sewer service, or
as to unusual or extraordinary use of sewer facilities.
      (2)   Failure to report to the city additions to the property or fixtures
to be supplied, or of additional use of water/sewer service.
      (3)   Resale or giving away of water.
      (4)   Waste or misuse of water due to improper or imperfect service pipes
or failure to keep same in suitable state of repair.
      (5)   Tampering with meter, meter seal, service, or valves, or permitting
such tampering by others.
      (6)   Connection, cross-connection, or permitting the same, of any
separate water supply to premises which receive water from the city.
      (7)   Failure to timely pay any bill or to abide by any notice sent to a
customer by the city in connection with water or sewer service.
   (C)   Any customer desiring to discontinue the water/sewer service to his
premises for any reason must give notice of discontinuance in writing at city
hall; otherwise a customer shall remain liable for all water used and water/
sewer services rendered to such premises by the city unless said notice is
received by the city. No person shall remain in a dwelling or building not
connected to the water and sewer system, and if so, same shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties of §
50.99 hereof.
   (D)   Bills and notices relating to the conduct of the business of the city
will be mailed to the customer at the address listed on the application unless
a change of address has been filed in writing with the city. The city shall not
otherwise be responsible for the delivery of any bill or notice nor will the
customer be excused from the payment of any bill or any performance required in
said notice. It shall be the responsibility of each property owner, or his/her/
its agent, whose real estate is leased, to monitor the account to insure that
the bills for water or sewer service are being paid in a timely fashion and
that the account is in good standing.
   (E)   (1)   Meters will be read once monthly between the fifteenth and
twenty-fifth of each month.
      (2)   Bills for water and sewer service are due and payable at City Hall,
or to any designated agent, on their date of issue. The past due date shall be
the fifteenth day of the month after the date of issue. Bills will be dated and
mailed on or before the first day of each month. A service fee of thirty-five
dollars ($35) will be assessed for any check returned by the maker’s bank for
any reason. If a customer’s personal check is returned by the maker’s bank for
any reason three (3) times within a twelve (12) month period, the city will no
longer accept such customer’s personal check; subsequent payments must be paid
in cash, by certified or cashier’s check, by money order or by credit card.
      (3)   All bills not paid on or before the past due date shall be deemed
delinquent, and shall be assessed a ten percent (10%) late penalty payment. In
addition, the city may serve a customer a written final notice of said
delinquency. The city will also serve notice that such customer is entitled,
upon written request, to a hearing on the question of termination of service.
If a delinquent bill is not paid within ten days after the date of final
notice, and if no hearing is requested, or if a hearing is requested and timely
held, and such customer's delinquency is thereby established, the water supply
to the customer may be discontinued without further notice; provided, however,
if prior to discontinuance of service, there is delivered to the city, or to
its employee empowered to discontinue service, a written certificate signed by
a physician, a registered nurse, or a public health officer that, in the
opinion of the certifier, discontinuance of service will aggravate an existing
illness or infirmity on the affected premises, service shall not be
discontinued until the affected resident can make other living arrangements or
until ten days elapse from the time of the city's receipt of said
certification, whichever occurs first.
      (4)   If a deadline date falls on a Sunday or legal holiday, such
deadline shall not expire until the next succeeding secular day.
   (F)   Where the water supply to the customer has been discontinued for non-
payment of delinquent bills, a charge of thirty dollars ($30) will be made for
reconnection of water service. However the reconnection will not be made until
after all delinquent bills and other charges, if any, owed by the customer to
the city have been paid.
   (G)   All meters shall be installed, renewed, and maintained at the expense
of the city except where commercial or industrial installations are required in
accordance with §
50.18. The city reserves the right to determine the size and type of meter
used.
   (H)   Upon written request of any customer, the meter serving said customer
may be tested by the city. Such test will be made without charge to the
customer if the meter fails to run within the approved range. A charge of
twenty-five dollars ($25) will be made if the meter passes said test.
   (I)   Where a meter has ceased to register, or meter reading cannot be
obtained, the quantity of water consumed will be based upon an average of the
prior six months' consumption, considering the conditions of water service
prevailing during the period in which the meter fails to register.
   (J)   The city shall make all reasonable efforts to eliminate interruption
of service, and, when such interruptions occur, will endeavor to re-establish
service with the shortest possible delay. When the service is interrupted, all
consumers affected by such interruption will be notified in advance whenever
possible.
   (K)   The city shall in no event be held responsible for any claim made
against it by reason of the breaking of any mains or service pipes, or by
reason of any other interruptions of the supply of water caused by the failure
or breakage of machinery or stoppage for necessary repairs. No person shall be
entitled to damages nor for any portion of a payment refunded for any
interruption of service which in the opinion of the city may be deemed
necessary.
   (L)   Customers having boilers and or pressure vessels receiving a supply of
water from the city must have a check valve on the water supply line and a
vacuum valve on the steam line to prevent collapse in case water supply from
the city is discontinued or interrupted for any reason, with or without notice.
   (M)   Piping on the premises of a customer must be so installed that
connections are conveniently located with respect to the city lines and mains.
The customer shall provide a place for which is unobstructed and accessible at
all times. The customer shall furnish and maintain a cutoff valve on his side
of the meter, and the city will furnish a like valve on its side of the meter.
   (N)   The customer's service lines shall be installed and maintained by the
customer at his own expense in a safe and efficient manner and in accordance
with the city's rules and regulations and with the regulations of the
Department of Health.
   (O)   If any loss or damage to the property of the city or any accident or
other injury to persons or property is caused by or results from the negligence
or wrongful action of the customer, member or his household, his agent or
employee, the cost of the necessary repairs or replacements shall be paid by
the customer to the city, and any liability otherwise resulting shall be that
of the customer.
   (P)   Each customer shall grant or convey, or shall cause to be granted or
conveyed, to the city, a perpetual easement and right-of-way across any
property owned or controlled by the customer whenever said easement or right-
of-way is necessary for the city water/sewer facilities and lines so as to
enable the city to furnish service to the customer.
   (Q)   (1)   Water for building or construction purposes will be furnished by
meter measurement only after suitable deposit has been made. The minimum
deposit for a 3/4-inch meter shall be twenty-five dollars ($25), the minimum
deposit for a 2-inch meter shall be five hundred dollars ($500). The rental
amount shall be determined by the city based upon the size of the construction
work contemplated. All water for building or construction purposes, as set
forth in the permit, must pass through one and the same meter.
      (2)   Water so supplied shall be discharged through a hose or pipe
directly upon the material to be made wet or into a barrel or other container.
In no case shall water be discharged upon the ground or into or through a ditch
or trench. All use of water for any purpose or upon any premises not so stated
or described in the application must be prevented by the applicant or water
service may be discontinued to the applicant without notice.
   (R)   Special terms and conditions may be made where water is used by the
city or community for public purposes such as fire extinguishment, public
parks, and the like.
   (S)   (1)   The city will construct extensions to its water and sewer lines
to points within its service area, but the city is not required to make any
such installations unless the customer pays to the city the entire cost of the
installation.
      (2)   All line extensions shall be evidenced by a contract signed by the
city and the person advancing funds for said extension.
      (3)   No refund shall be made from any revenue received from any lines
leading up to or beyond the particular line extension covered by contract.
      (4)   All decisions in connection with the manner of installation of any
extension and maintenance thereof shall remain in the exclusive control of the
city; such extension shall be the property of the city; and no other person
shall have any right, title or interest therein.
   (T)   The city may refuse service to any person, not presently a customer,
when in the opinion of the city the capacity of the facilities will not permit
such service.
   (U)   No person, firm, company, or corporation, except those presently
obtaining such service, outside the present corporate limits of the city, but
whose property is contiguous to the city and otherwise eligible for annexation,
is permitted to obtain water service from the city without being annexed to the
city.
   (V)   These rules may be changed or amended.
   (W)   Complaints may be made to the manager of the system, whose decision
may be appealed to the governing body of the city within ten days; otherwise,
the manager's decision will be final.
   (X)   The city or its authorized agent may inspect the grease control
equipment (“GCE”) of any restaurant or food service establishment located
within the city limits during regular business hours to determine if the GCE is
functioning properly and is being properly maintained. Each restaurant and food
service establishment shall maintain a record of the date(s) their GCE was
serviced, with the name of the service provider. Said record shall include all
service for the previous twelve months, and shall be provided to the city’s
agent upon demand. The city may require modifications to be made to the GCE if
deemed necessary. The city may require additional cleaning if the GCE is of
inadequate size or is not working properly. The city may require GCE to be
installed if none is present. The penalty for failure to comply with any order
of the city for modification, maintenance or installation of GCE or for failure
to maintain a written record of GCE service shall be as set forth in Section
50.99(A).

not be adequate to provide treated water to meet normal needs to the city, it
shall be empowered to declare by resolution, municipal order, or other proper
local legislative enactment that a water shortage alert exists. The city,
through its Council or Mayor, shall continue to encourage voluntary water
conservation measures defined under the advisory declaration, and further shall
impose a ban on all nonessential (Class 3) water uses for the duration of the
shortage until the city has declared it to have ended, or upon the expiration
of any time limit that may have been set forth in the declaration by the city.
Publication or public notice of such declarations shall conform to the
procedures as set forth in §
50.78 and shall be effective upon publication in the official newspaper for
city publications under state law.

§ 50.80 WATER SHORTAGE EMERGENCY DECLARED.
   Whenever the City Council finds that primary water supplies are below the
level necessary to provide the quality and quantity of treated water to meet
normal needs that serious shortages of treated water exists to serve the city,
City Council shall be empowered to declare by resolution, municipal order, or
other proper local legislative enactment that a water shortage emergency
exists. Essential uses (Class I) shall be identified, in specific, as uses for
voluntary conservation initiatives. Also, all socially or economically
important uses (Class 2) shall be banned in addition to the nonessential uses
(Class 3). These restrictions shall be considered continuing until the
emergency phase is declared ended by resolution, municipal order, or other
proper local legislative enactment by the City Council. Declaration or
publication of these resolutions, municipal orders, or other proper local
legislative enactment shall follow the procedures set forth in §
50.78, but declarations of a water shortage emergency shall be immediately
effective as an emergency measure upon passage of the resolution, municipal
order, or other proper legislative enactment.
(Ord. 1988-13, passed 7-25-88) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.81 WATER SHORTAGE CRITICAL EMERGENCY DECLARED.
   Whenever the City Council finds that treated water supplies have been so
depleted with no reasonable expectation for replenishing such treated water
supplies that preservation of water for essential water use (Class 1) is
essential and necessary for the public health, safety, and welfare through the
measure of rationing of treated water supplies, the City Council shall be
empowered to declare by resolution, municipal order, or other proper local
legislative enactment that a water shortage critical emergency exists.
Essential uses (Class 1) shall be specifically identified as uses for which
rationing is required and shall specifically identify any other uses for which
voluntary conservation initiatives are still in effect. All other uses
contained within the essential uses classification, all socially or
economically important uses (Class 2) and all nonessential uses (Class 3) shall
be banned. These restrictions shall be considered continuing until the critical
emergency is declared ended by the city. Publication or notice of resolution,
municipal order, or other proper local legislative enactment declaring a water
shortage critical emergency shall follow the procedures set forth in §
50.78, but any such declaration shall become immediately effective upon passage
of such resolution, municipal order, or other proper local legislative
enactment by the City Council.

§ 50.82 WATER SHORTAGE RATES.
   Upon declaration of a water shortage phase as provided herein, the City
Council shall have the power to adopt shortage water rates, by ordinance,
designed to conserve water supplies. These rates may provide for, but not be
limited to: (1) higher charges per unit for increasing usage; (2) uniform
charges for water usage per unit of use; (3) extra charges for use in excess of
a specified level; or (4) discounts for conserving water beyond specified
levels.
(Ord. 1988-13, passed 7-25-88)
§ 50.83 WATER RATIONING AUTHORITY; ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   In the event the City Council determines that a water shortage
critical emergency exists, thereby imposing rationing of the treated water
supply, the City Council shall be and is hereby authorized and empowered to
adopt or enact as an emergency ordinance rationing levels for all customers of
water in the city through its distribution of water system. In any such
emergency ordinance in determining rationing levels, the city shall take into
account equitable distribution of critically limited water supplies and balance
demand with the limited availability of treated water and take all steps
necessary to reasonably assure that sufficient water is available to preserve
public health, safety, and welfare.
   (B)   (1)   An emergency ordinance imposing rationing as a measure of
conserving water passed by City Council may include methods of enforcement for
compliance. These methods of compliance, in addition to imposition of fines as
penalties may include excess use charges to be imposed on any water customer
exceeding the allotment set forth in the emergency ordinance for water
rationing. Any monies collected through this excess use charge procedure are to
be placed in a reserve or capital account for public improvements relating to
water supply projects.
      (2)   In addition to excess use charges, noncompliance with water
rationing may result in awarding of possible discontinuation of service for the
first excess use of a customer. Discontinuation of service may result from
second or subsequent excess use occurrences of a customer for a period of time
not to exceed 48 hours. Another measure that may be taken in lieu of
discontinuation of service is installation of a flow restrictor, the costs of
such installation to be paid by the customer. Prior to discontinuance or
interruption of service, any customer must be given prior written notice and
afforded the opportunity to address the City Council in the nature of an
appeal.

response phases set forth herein, the Mayor is empowered to issue an executive
order declaring that a particular water shortage response phase and the
regulatory measure imposed is a result of such phase being declared. As part of
that executive order, the Mayor shall set forth the basis or justification for
making such declaration on an emergency basis. The executive order declaring
any water shortage response phase shall continue into effect until suspended or
lifted by issuance of a subsequent executive order and in any event shall be
subject to approval of the City Council at its next regular or special meeting.

herein. A written notice of the violation shall be affixed or posted on the
property where the violation occurred and mailed to the customer of record or
to any other person known to be responsible for the violation or its
correction. This notice shall be sent by the Supervisor of Water and Sewer
Department or other proper designated entity and shall describe the violation
with direction that it be corrected, cured, or abated immediately or within a
certain specified time. If the order is not complied with by the customer,
termination of water service to the customer may occur, subject to the
following procedures: notice shall be given to the customer by mail that due to
the violation, water services will be discontinued within certain time and that
the customer has the opportunity to appeal that termination by requesting a
hearing before the City Council. If such a hearing is requested, the customer
shall be given a full opportunity to be heard before termination is ordered.
The City Council shall make findings from facts presented to it during any such
hearing prior to ordering termination of service and as an alternative to such
termination, may take other measures that are reasonable under the
circumstances to conserve water and yet still provide access of reasonable
service to the customer.

to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense
if the person denies the Code Enforcement Board reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity-authorized or
required by this subchapter.
      (7)   If the Code Enforcement Board has been refused access to any part
of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the Code Enforcement Board
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 53.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public
health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-
construction storm water runoff and non-point source pollution associated with
new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper
management of construction-related and post-construction storm water runoff
will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure,
safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare, protect water and
aquatic resources and establishes methods for controlling the introduction of
pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to
comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that protects
the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
   (B)   Minimizing changes to the pre-development hvdrologic response for new
development and redevelopment in their post-construction state in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter for the applicable design storm in order
to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, and non-point and point source
pollution, as well as to maintain the integrity of stream channels, aquatic
habitats and healthy stream temperatures;
   (C)   Establishing minimum post-construction storm water management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of storm water
runoff quantity and quality;
   (D)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function, and use of structural storm water control facilities that may be used
to meet the minimum post-construction storm water management standards;
   (E)   Establishing criteria for the use of better management and site design
practices, such as the preservation of green space and other conservation
areas;
   (F)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural storm water best management
practices (BMPs) to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are
maintained appropriately, and pose minimum risk to public safety; and
   (G)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of storm water management plans, for the inspection of
approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.

ceiling.
   (F)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any rooming
unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each

stairway leading up to an occupied area in such a manner as to assure that
rising smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector and the detector
intercepts rising smoke before it reaches the occupied area.

and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition.
   (E)   At every change of occupancy or every dwelling unit occasioned by or
incidental to a sale, lease, or sub-lease of said unit, it shall be the duty of
the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor, or sub-lessor, as the case may
be) to notify the new occupant that all smoke detectors as required by this
section (or other applicable laws) are installed and in proper working
condition. Failure to comply with this division (E) shall be punishable as set
forth herein, provided however, that this division shall not be construed to
violate or render void any contract, lease, or sub-lease subject hereto.

   (B)   In determining the amount and method of paying a fine for commission
of a felony, the court shall consider, among others, the following factors:
      (1)   The defendant's ability to pay the amount of the fine;
      (2)   The hardship likely to be imposed on the defendant's dependents by
the amount of the fine and the time and method of paying it;
      (3)   The impact the amount of the fine will have on the defendant's
ability to make reparation or restitution to the victim; and

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has in KRS Chapter 100 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the city does ordain the following sections set forth in this
chapter.
(Ord. 1997-06, Passed 4-14-97)
§ 156.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Walton are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damage.
(Ord. 1997-06, Passed 4-14-97)
§ 156.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE; OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters:
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage, and;
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas; and,
      (7)   To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a flood area.

foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first

would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Means any combination of repairs, reconstruction,
alteration or improvements to a building, taking place during a five (5) year
period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of the
market value of the building. The market value of the building should be (1)
the appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or
improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the building prior to
the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the
purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur
when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either; (1) any
project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the Code
Enforcement Official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS OR SUBDIVISIONS. Is
where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets,
utilities, and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets,
utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
   VARIANCE. Is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.

(Ord. 1997-06, Passed 4-14-97)
§ 156.22 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have
been provided, as set forth in Article 3, Section 2, or Article 4, Section 3
(9), the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential Construction .   New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood
waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article 5, Section 2
(3).
   (B)   Non-Residential Construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building (or
manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
one foot above the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A-Zones may
be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the
building below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of
buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in Article 4, Section 3 (7).
   (C)   Elevated Buildings . New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to
preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls.
      (1)   Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and,
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.
      (1)   All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved (i) outside
of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home
park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or, (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as
the result of a flood, must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring.
      (2)   All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or
above the level of the base flood elevation, or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above grade.
         (c)   The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the

      (5)   Floodways. - Located within areas of special flood hazard
established in Article 3, Section 2, are areas designated as floodways. Since
the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the
following provisions shall apply:
         (a)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood
levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
         (b)   If satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions.
(Ord. 1997-06, Passed 4-14-97)
§ 156.23 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3,
Section 2, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided
or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The
engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms

§ 156.25 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO) ZONES.
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3,
Section 2, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
(1'- 3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements or residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the
highest adjacent grade, at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on Walton's FIRM. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent
grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified on
Walton's FIRM. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent
grade; or
      (2)   Together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities be
completely flood-proofed to or above that level so that any space below that

rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
   (E)   In passing such applications, the Appeals Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case
of a functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (F)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of
this ordinance, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
   (G)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (H)   Conditions for Variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character
and design of the building;
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and, (iii) a determination that the granting of
a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause, fraud on
or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the building is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (4)   The Boone County Building Dept. (Local Administrator) shall
maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(Ord. 1997-06, Passed 4-14-97)
