parts standing alone are incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the intent of the legislative body.

§ 10.08 CONFLICT OR AMBIGUITY.

subsequent meeting of Council as long as it takes effect prior to the effective

unchanged with respect to an amendment which is repealed at the same meeting of
Council which enacted the amendment.

repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of Council as long as the
repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the original
amendment.

have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or amendment,
as the case may be.

offense committed against a former ordinance; nor as to any act done; or
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred; or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance; or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done; or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
so incurred; or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance
takes effect, except that the proceedings thereafter had shall conform, so far
as practicable, to the laws in force at the time of such proceedings. If any
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment is mitigated by any provision of the new
ordinance, such provision may, by the consent of the party affected, be applied
to any judgment pronounced after the new ordinance takes effect.

sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under

the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter be
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   This code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code

prior to the codification and not inconsistent thereto, shall remain in effect
and are saved.

   Any chapter, section, or division amended or added to this code by
ordinances passed subsequent to this code may be numbered in accordance with
the numbering system of this code and printed for inclusion herein. Any
chapter, section, or division repealed by subsequent ordinances may be excluded
from this code by omission from reprinted pages. Subsequent ordinances as
printed or omitted shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances
until Council shall adopt a new code of ordinances.
§ 10.16 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   If the provisions of different codes, chapters, or sections of the codified
ordinances conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions bearing the
latest passage date shall prevail. If the conflicting provisions bear the same
passage date, the conflict shall be so construed as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
§ 10.17 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of the city exercising the powers, duties, or
functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.18 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error be discovered consisting of the misspelling of any word
or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can
be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express the intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and
the word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the
correct words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration
shall be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or
extent of such error.

meaning, or effect of any act of the city legislative body, but may renumber
sections and parts of sections of the acts of the city legislative body; change
the wording of head notes; divide or rearrange sections and parts of sections;

published, the City Clerk may substitute the name of any agency, officer, or

(2008 Code, § 1.04.100)
§ 10.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Offenses designated by ordinances; penalties. The city may make the
violation of any of its ordinances or code a misdemeanor or a violation by the
express terms of the ordinance. When the offense is designated by the ordinance
as a misdemeanor, a criminal fine not to exceed $500 or a term of imprisonment
not to exceed 12 months or both may be imposed for the offense. When the
offense is designated by ordinance as a violation, a criminal fine not to
exceed $250 may be imposed for the offense.
   (B)   Offenses not designated by ordinance; penalties. If any city ordinance
or this code fails to prescribe any penalty for noncompliance with its
provisions, any noncompliance shall be deemed a violation and a criminal fine
not to exceed $250 may be imposed for the offense.
   (C)   Penalties for violation deemed criminal; exceptions.
      (1)   Where any city ordinance or this code prescribes a penalty for
violation or noncompliance, such penalty shall be deemed a criminal penalty,
not a civil penalty, unless the ordinance clearly states that a civil penalty
attaches to such violation or noncompliance.
      (2)   As an alternative to or in conjunction with the criminal penalties
authorized in this chapter, an ordinance may provide by its express terms that
a violation shall subject the offender to a civil penalty to be recovered by
the city in a civil action in the nature of debt if the offender does not pay
the penalty within a prescribed period of time after he or she has been cited
for the violation of the ordinance.
      (3)   Where the amount of a civil penalty is not stated in the ordinance,
the civil penalty shall be the amount of the minimum criminal penalty for such
violation, but not less than $25.
   (D)   Conflict with state provisions. Notwithstanding the provision of any
ordinance hereafter of heretofore enacted, no city ordinance shall impose a
fine, penalty, forfeiture, or term of imprisonment less than or greater than
that imposed by state statute for the same offense, and where the fine provided
by city ordinance is different, the fine, penalty, forfeiture, or term of
imprisonment provided by state statute shall apply.
   (E)   Continuing violations. Any continuing violation of a city ordinance or
this code shall be considered as a separate and distinct offense for each day a
violation of the ordinance occurs or continues.

   The City Council finds and declares the following.
   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of the city depends upon
the public’s confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers
and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the private
interests and the public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence
is imperiled.
   (C)   The government of the city has a duty to provide its citizens with the
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.

application, and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
KRS Chapter 65, as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS Chapter 65.

(2008 Code, § 2.44.010)
§ 35.02 INITIAL REQUEST FOR RECORDS WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.

shall make a request for inspection at the office of the City Clerk during
regular office hours, except during legal holidays. The official custodian, or
the custodian acting under the authority of the official custodian, may require
a request to inspect public records to be in writing, signed by the applicant,

request to inspect public records may be presented by hand delivery, mail, or
via facsimile, if one is available.
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in compliance
with this subchapter and the open records law, and the requested public records

inspection. A person may inspect public records at the designated office of the
city during the regular office hours, or in appropriate cases, by receiving
copies of the records through the mail.

which the public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(2008 Code, § 2.44.040)
§ 35.05 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies thereof. However, refusal under this section must be sustained by
clear and convincing evidence.
(2008 Code, § 2.44.050)

      (1)   Public records containing information of a personal nature where
the public disclosure thereof would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion

records the disclosure or publication of which is directed by other statute;

not apply to records the disclosure or publication of which is directed by
statute.

or industry where no previous public disclosure has been made of the business
or industry’s interest in locating in, relocating within, or expanding within
the commonwealth. This exemption shall not include those records pertaining to
applications to agencies for permits or licenses necessary to do business or to
expand business operations within the state, except as provided in division (A)
(2) above;
      (4)   The contents of real estate appraisals or engineering or
feasibility estimates and evaluations made by or for a public agency relative
to the acquisition of property, until such time as all of the property has been
acquired. The law of eminent domain shall not be affected by this provision;
      (5)   Test questions, scoring keys, and other examination data used to
administer a licensing examination, examination for employment, or academic
examination before the exam is given or if it is to be given again;
      (6)   Records of law enforcement agencies or agencies involved in
administrative adjudication that were compiled in the process of detecting and
investigating statutory or regulatory violations, if the disclosure of the
information would harm the agency by revealing the identity of informants not
otherwise known or by premature release of information to be used in a
prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this subchapter, public records exempted under
this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a
decision is made to take no action. The exemptions provided by this section
shall not be used by the custodian of the records to delay or impede the
exercise of rights granted by this subchapter;
      (7)   Preliminary drafts, notes, or correspondence with private
individuals, other than correspondence which is intended to give notice of
final action of a public agency;
      (8)   Preliminary recommendations and preliminary memoranda in which

prohibited by federal law or regulation; and
      (10)   Public records or information the disclosure of which is
prohibited or restricted or otherwise made confidential by enactment of the
General Assembly.
   (B)   No exemption under this section shall be construed to prohibit
disclosure of statistical information not descriptive of any readily
identifiable person. In addition, if any public record contains material which
is not excepted under this section, the city shall separate the excepted and
make the nonexcepted material available for examination, subject to the
possible applicability of §
35.05.
   (C)   The provisions of this section shall in no way prohibit or limit the
exchange of public records or the sharing of information between public
agencies when the exchange is serving a legitimate governmental need or is
necessary in the performance of a legitimate government function.
   (D)   No exemption under this section shall be construed to deny, abridge,
or impede the right of a municipal employee, an applicant for employment, or an
eligible person on a register to inspect and copy any record, including
preliminary and other supporting documentation, that relates to him or her.
Such records shall include, but not be limited to, work plans, job performance,
demotions, evaluations, promotions, compensation, classification, reallocation,
transfers, layoffs, disciplinary actions, examination scores, and preliminary

shall not have the right to inspect or copy any examination or any documents
relating to ongoing criminal or administrative investigations by any agency.

any other person shall, in any manner, activate, utilize, or otherwise operate

equitable remedies available to the city.
   (E)   Each compilation, publication, tabulation, or other dissemination of
each piece of information made or permitted to be made in violation of this
section shall be considered a separate violation of this chapter.
   (F)   A subscriber may, at any time, revoke any authorization previously
made by delivering to the franchisee, in writing, a substantial indication of
his or her intent to so revoke. Any such revocation shall be effective on
receipt by the franchisee.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.150)
§ 111.30 INTERCONNECTION.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as to prohibit the

become necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Mayor of the city, to cut
or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, or other appurtenances to the
network of the franchisee, such cutting or moving may be done and any repairs
rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the franchisee, at its sole
expense; provided, that such repairs are not necessitated by a negligent act of
the city, in which case, cost for repairs shall be borne by the city.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.160)
§ 111.31 EMERGENCIES.
   (A)   In the event of an emergency or disaster, a franchisee shall, upon the
request of the Louisville Metro Mayor, make available its facilities to the

use during the period of such emergency or disaster, and shall provide such
personnel as necessary to properly operate the system under the circumstances.

an override alert system, whereby the Louisville Metro Mayor, in a time of
crisis, may be able to introduce a bulletin on all channels simultaneously.

rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the franchisee, at its sole
expense; provided that such repairs are not necessitated by a negligent act of
the city, in which case, cost for repairs shall be borne by the city.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.170)
§ 111.32 RATES.
   (A)   The City Council expressly reserves the right and retains its
jurisdiction to authorize, establish, and approve all rates which the
franchisee charges subscribers, including rates for subscriber service,
equipment, maintenance, and repair. By acceptance of a franchise, the
franchisee agrees that the City Council shall have such power, right, and
jurisdiction. All rates and charges shall be nondiscriminatory.
   (B)   No rate, fee, or charge of any kind shall be charged or collected from
subscribers by the franchisee without the authorization and approval of the
City Council. Violation of this section shall be deemed to be a breach of any
agreement awarding a franchise in accordance herewith and shall subject the
franchisee to all remedies and penalties prescribed in this chapter and to all
other remedies, legal and equitable, which are available to the city.
   (C)   The initial rates to be charged and collected from subscribers shall
be in conformity with the franchisee’s application hereunder, and established
in the agreement awarding a franchise in accordance herewith, and shall remain
in force for a minimum of 30 months from and after the date of execution of the
said agreement and the effective date of the chapter awarding the franchise;
provided, however, that should the City Council determine to amend any
franchise within the purview of §
111.42, the franchisee may request rate increases or decreases in accordance
with this section.
   (D)   The franchisee shall file with the City Clerk on December 31 of each
year a full schedule of all subscriber and user rates and all other charges
made in connection with the operation of the cable communications system.
      (1)   Any and all special rates for institutions, motels, hotels, inns,
multiple-family dwelling units, or any other type of sub-dwelling units, or any
other type of subscriber shall be included.
      (2)   All rates shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk of the
city.
   (E)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the reduction
or waiving of charges in conjunction with promotional campaigns for the purpose
of attracting subscribers or users.
   (F)   The franchisee shall neither impose nor collect any additional charge
for the disconnection of any installation or outlet.
   (G)   In the event that a subscriber fails to pay a property due and owing
fee or charge, the franchisee may disconnect the subscriber’s service outlet
upon giving ten days’ written notice thereof.
   (H)   The franchisee shall establish and conform to the following policy
regarding refunds to subscribers and users.
      (1)   If the franchisee collects a deposit or advance charge on any
service or equipment requested by a subscriber or user, the franchisee shall
provide said service or equipment within 30 days of the collection of the
deposit or charge or it shall refund said deposit or charge within five days
thereafter.
         (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve the
franchisee of any responsibility to subscribers or users under any contractual
agreements into which it enters with them.
         (b)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the
franchisee’s liability for penalties which may be imposed under this chapter or
for the violation or breach of any of its provisions.
         (c)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
franchisee’s liability for damages because of its failure to provide the
service for which the deposit or charge was made.
      (2)   In the event that a subscriber terminates service during the first
12 months because of the failure of the franchisee to render the service in
accordance with the requirements set forth in this chapter, or in any agreement
or chapter in accordance herewith, the franchisee shall refund to such
subscriber an amount equal to the initial applicable installation or
reconnection charge paid by the subscriber. In the event that such subscriber
has made an advanced payment, the amount so advanced shall be refunded to such
subscriber by the franchisee. Nothing in this division (H)(2) shall be
construed to relieve the franchisee of any liability established under any
other provision of this chapter or any agreement or chapter in accordance
herewith.
      (3)   In the event that a subscriber terminates service prior to the end
of a pre-paid period, the pro rata portion of any prepaid subscriber fee which
represents payment for services which are no longer to be rendered shall be
refunded promptly, but in no case more than 30 days after receipt of the
request for termination.
   (I)   The franchisee shall not charge a converter security deposit greater
than said converter’s actual cost to the franchisee. Any converter security
deposit collected by the franchisee shall be returned to the subscriber 36
months after the installation of such converter or within 60 days upon
termination of service by the subscriber and return of converter undamaged,
with allowance for reasonable wear and tear, and payment of any outstanding
balance due and payable.
   (J)   A franchisee may, from time to time, subject to the limitation
contained in division (C) above, request of the City Council rate increases or
decreases. A franchisee shall be allowed to increase its rates and charges if
it is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City Council that it is
unable to realize a fair return on its investment without a rate or charge
increase. The City Council shall establish the procedure for hearings and
review of any such request. The City Council may allow rate or charge
reduction, at any time, if it shall determine that the existing rates and
charges unreasonably restrict the growth of cable television in the city and
that the proposed rates and charges will continue to allow the franchisee a
reasonable profit. Any such request shall be made no less than 60 days in
advance of the effective date of the change or changes requested.
   (K)   A franchisee may, at any time, request of the City Council,
establishment, authorization, and approval of rates and charges for new or
additional services which the franchisee desires to offer its subscribers. Any
such request shall be made no less than 60 days in advance of the offering of
such new or additional services.
   (L)   In the event the franchisee for the city also has a CATV franchise for
the unincorporated area of Louisville Metro, the rates for like services in the
city shall not exceed the rates charged for identical services in the
unincorporated area of Louisville Metro. In the event that the Louisville Metro
Council approves a rate increase or reduction for the same CATV franchisee that
has the city franchise, the franchisee shall, within ten days thereafter, file
with the City Clerk a complete schedule of the Louisville Metro approved CATV
rates. The City Clerk shall forthwith advise all members of the City Council
and the Mayor of the approved Louisville Metro CATV rate schedule. Unless the
franchisee, a member of the City Council, or the Mayor requests a CATV rate
hearing for city rates within 60 days after the filing of the approved
Louisville Metro CATV rate schedule with the City Clerk, the approved
Louisville Metro CATV rate schedule shall automatically be the approved and
authorized CATV rate schedule for the city, effective 61 days after the
approved Louisville Metro CATV rate schedule is filed with the City Clerk by
the franchisee.
   (M)   No charge shall be made to the city for its use of government access
channels, and under no circumstances shall the city be obligated to pay to a
franchisee any fee for service rendered to the city under the terms of the
franchise.
   (N)   Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the setting of special
rates for certain classes of citizens for certain types of subscriber service,
when, by the determination of the City Council and at its sole discretion, such
special rates are justified by the potential of such service to assist with the
health, care, and/or safety of such citizens.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.180)
§ 111.33 POLICE POWERS.
   Nothing in this chapter or in any agreement or chapter in accordance
herewith shall be construed as an abrogation by the city of any of its police
powers.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.190)
§ 111.34 TRANSFER AND ASSIGNMENTS.
   (A)   The franchisee shall not transfer, assign, sell, lease, or dispose of
its interest in any franchise or chapter or agreement awarding a franchise in
accordance herewith or in its cable communications system without the prior
written authorization of the City Council. A merger or consolidation shall be
deemed a transfer or assignment.
   (B)   During the term of any franchise, the franchisee shall not sell,
transfer, assign, lease, dispose of, exchange, or release more than 25% of the
ownership of its cable communications system to a person (hereinafter “proposed
transferee”) without the prior written authorization of City Council. The City
Council may require such information as it reasonably deems necessary from the
franchisee in connection with a proposal to sell, transfer, assign, lease,
dispose of, exchange, or release of more than 25% of the ownership of its cable
communications system.
   (C)   Any proposed transferee shall execute an agreement in the form and
containing the conditions approved by the City Attorney that it will assume and
be bound by all of the provisions, terms, and conditions of this chapter and
any agreement or ordinance in accordance herewith and all applicable federal,
state, and local laws and, further, that it shall be primarily liable and
obligated under said documents without, however, relieving the franchisee from
its obligations to the city under said document.
   (D)   No transfer under divisions (A) and (B) above shall be made within 13
months of the termination date of the term of franchise agreement.
   (E)   Nothing in any approval by the City Council of any transfer or
assignment of any ownership interest, pursuant to divisions (A) and (B) above,
shall be construed to waive or release any rights of the city in and to the
streets, public ways, and public places of the city or as a release of any of
the city’s police powers.
   (F)   The occurrence of any event which constitutes either grounds for entry
of an order for relief under the U.S. bankruptcy code, or placement of the
franchisee into receivership, or the issuance of any order to the franchisee or
any of its stockholders by a government agency or court of competent
jurisdiction to divest any interest related to the cable communications system
hereunder, or the entry of any judgment against the franchisee which, in the
opinion of the City Council, impairs the franchisee’s credit shall be deemed an
unauthorized transfer and assignment under the provisions of this section and
shall:
      (1)   Be deemed a material breach and default of any agreement or chapter
awarding a franchise in accordance herewith; and
      (2)   Subject the franchisee to all penalties and remedies prescribed in
the agreement and to all other remedies, legal and equitable, which are
available to the city.
   (G)   The occurrence of an unauthorized transfer or assignment may, at the
option of the city, terminate any agreement and franchise and accelerate all of
the obligations and rights thereunder, including inter alia, the right of the
city to purchase the cable communications system at book value or to award a
franchise to another person. The franchisee shall notify the City Clerk of any
occurrence which constitutes an unauthorized transfer under the provisions of
division (F) above and of the entry of any judgment against it within 24 hours
of such occurrence.
   (H)   From and after any of the occurrences enumerated in division (F)
above, the franchisee shall not make, execute, or enter into any deed, deed of
trust, mortgage, contract, conditional sales contract, or any loan, lease,
pledge, sale, pole agreement, or any other agreement or hypothecation
concerning any of the facilities or property, real or personal, of the cable
communications system without the written approval of City Council.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.200)
§ 111.35 ABANDONMENT.
   In the event that the use of any part of the system is discontinued for any
reason, by any franchisee, for a continuous period of 12 months, or in the
event such system or property has been installed in any street or public place
without complying with requirements of this chapter, or the rights granted
hereunder have been terminated, cancelled, or have expired, the franchisee
shall promptly remove from the streets and public places all such property and
poles of such system, other than any which the city may permit to be abandoned
in place, and in the event of such removal, the franchisee shall promptly
restore the street or other area from which such property has been removed to a
condition satisfactory to the City Council. Any property of a franchisee
abandoned in place shall be abandoned in such manner as the City Council may
prescribe. Upon a permanent abandonment of the property of a franchisee in
place, the franchisee shall submit to the City Council an instrument to be
approved by the City Council transferring to the city ownership of such
property.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.210)
§ 111.36 CONDITIONS OF STREET OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   All transmissions and distribution structures, lines, and equipment
erected by the franchisee within the city shall be so located as to cause
minimum interference with the proper use of streets, alleys, and other public
ways and places and to cause minimum interference with the rights and
reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of said streets,
alleys, or other public places. The cable communications system shall be
constructed and operated in compliance with all adopted local and national
construction and safety codes.
   (B)   The installation of the cable communications system shall be in
accordance with all applicable laws, codes, chapters, rules, and regulations of
the commonwealth and the city affecting electrical installations and buildings,
now or hereafter in effect.
   (C)   Except when absolutely necessary to service a subscriber and not
simply because it shall be more convenient, economical, or profitable for the
franchisee to so operate, and then only when expressly permitted in writing by
the City Engineer or the Mayor, under such conditions as he or she shall
prescribe for the public welfare, the franchisee shall not erect or authorize
or permit others to erect any poles or other facilities within the streets of
the city for conduct of its cable communications system, but shall use the
existing poles and other equipment of the appropriate electrical power and
telephone or other utility companies under such terms and agreements as the
franchisee shall negotiate with these companies. The franchisee shall use its
best efforts to ensure that the terms and agreements between the franchisee and
any utility company are concluded in a reasonable time with no unnecessary
delay.
   (D)   Franchisee shall not locate any of its property aboveground in any
area between the rear wall of any residence and the street, whether on private
property or public right-of-way. If franchisee shall in any case be unable, for
operational reasons only, to locate any property underground, the City Council
may permit a limited amount of such property in front of a residence upon such
terms and conditions as the Council may require.
   (E)   The franchisee may trim trees which infringe upon easements, rights-
of-way, or streets of the city to prevent the trees from coming in contact with
the cable communications system.
   (F)   The franchisee shall, at its expense, protect, support, temporarily
disconnect, relocate, or remove any property of the franchisee located on
streets, public places, rights-of-way, and easements of the city, when required
by the City Council because of traffic conditions, public safety, street
vacation, freeway, and street construction, change or establishment of street
grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines,
and tracks or any other type of structures or improvements by the city or the
commonwealth. If the franchisee fails to do so, the city or the commonwealth
may cause the necessary work to be completed and the franchisee shall pay the
cost thereof within ten days of receipt of an itemized account of such cost.
   (G)   Whenever the city or the commonwealth shall require the relocation or
reinstallation of any property of the franchisee in any of the streets or
public places of the city, it shall be the obligation of the franchisee upon
notice of such requirement to immediately remove and relocate or reinstall said
property as may be reasonably necessary at the sole cost of the franchisee.
   (H)   Whenever, in any place within the city, all or any part of the
electric or telephone utilities shall be located underground, it shall be the
obligation of the franchisee to locate or to cause its property to be located
underground within such places. If the electric or telephone utilities shall be
located underground, in any place within the city after the franchisee shall
have previously installed its property, nevertheless, the franchisee shall, at
the same time or immediately thereafter, remove and relocate its property also
underground in such places. If the franchisee shall in case be unable, for
operational reasons only, to locate or relocate any part of its property
underground, then in that event the City Engineer or the Mayor upon being
satisfied as to the facts thereof and subject to the concurrence of the City
Council may permit such property to remain above the ground even though other
facilities may be placed underground in the area. However, any such permission
shall be upon such conditions as the City Council may require for the public
welfare. Any facilities of the franchisee placed underground at the property
owner’s request, in an area where electric and telephone facilities are aerial,
shall be installed with the additional expense paid by the property owner.
   (I)   In the case of disturbance of any street caused by the franchisee, the
franchisee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the
City Engineer or the Mayor, replace and restore such street, in such a
condition as before the work involving such disturbance was done.
   (J)   The franchisee shall, upon request, temporarily raise or tower its
wires to permit the moving of buildings or other things. The expense of such
temporary removal or raising or lowering of the wires shall be paid by the
person requesting the same and the franchisee shall have the authority to
require such payment in advance. The franchisee shall be given not less than 72
hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.220)
§ 111.37 ARRANGEMENTS BY FRANCHISE WITH OTHERS.
   There is granted to the franchisee authority to lease, rent, or in any other
manner obtain the use of towers, poles, lines, cables, licenses, and utilities
within the city, including, but not limited to, the South Central Bell
Telephone Company and Louisville Gas and Electric Company, and in each instance
the franchisee shall make its own contractual arrangements with such entity in
order to obtain the use of towers, poles, lines, cables, and other facilities
and shall report their arrangements to the City Engineer or the Mayor.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.230)
§ 111.38 REVIEW, RENEWAL, TERMINATION, AND CANCELLATION.
   (A)   The procedure for renewal or termination of any franchise or agreement
or ordinance awarding the franchise in accordance herewith shall require public
hearings prior to action by the City Council. Hearings in connection with a
renewal of a franchise shall take place not less than 90 days prior to the
termination of the franchise. The City Council shall, after a hearing, take
such action as its deems appropriate, which may include any of the following.

      (4)   The City Council may determine not to authorize the award of any
further franchise, and thereupon may direct the franchisee to dismantle its
cable communication system. If the franchisee determines not to renew the
agreement awarding a franchise in accordance herewith, the City Council shall
proceed to follow one of the courses under divisions (B)(2) or (B)(3) below.
   (B)   (1)   The City Council may terminate any agreement awarding a
franchise in accordance herewith in the event of the violation of any provision
hereof or of any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant hereto or of any
applicable federal, state, or local law, or the breach or other failure,
refusal, or neglect by the franchisee to perform its obligations under the
terms and conditions of the chapter or any ordinance or agreement awarding a
franchise in accordance herewith, except when such violation, breach, failure,
refusal, or neglect is caused by any of the following:
         (a)   Act of God;
         (b)   Riot;
         (c)   An emergency declared by the President of the country, the
Governor of the commonwealth, or the Louisville Metro Mayor; or
         (d)   A condition beyond the control of the franchisee.
      (2)   In the event that the City Council determines that the franchisee
has violated any provision of this chapter, any rule or regulation promulgated
pursuant hereto, any applicable federal, state, or local law, or any term of an
agreement or chapter awarding a franchise, except as noted in divisions (B)(1)
(a) through (B)(1)(d) above, the City Council shall make a written demand on
the franchisee that it comply with the law or said agreement or ordinance; if
the violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not remedied to the
satisfaction of the City Council, within 30 days following such demand, the
City Council shall determine whether or not, in its sole discretion, such
violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect by the franchisee was excusable
or inexcusable as provided in divisions (B)(1)(a) through (B)(1)(d) above.
         (a)   If the City Council determines such violation, breach, failure,
refusal, or neglect by the franchisee was excusable as provided in divisions
(B)(1)(a) through (B)(1)(d) above, the City Council shall direct the franchisee
to correct or remedy the same with such additional time, in such manner, and
upon such terms and conditions as the City Council may direct.
         (b)   If the City Council determines such violation, breach, failure,
refusal, or neglect by the franchisee was inexcusable, as provided in divisions
(B)(1)(a) through (B)(1)(d) above, then the City Council shall declare this
chapter, the franchise, or the agreement or chapter awarding a franchise in
accordance herewith breached, terminated, and of no further force and effect.
This action shall be taken by ordinance. Termination shall in no way limit the
rights of the city or the franchisee to any remedies, legal or equitable,
available to the city or franchisee.
      (3)   If the City Council declares the said agreement breached pursuant
to divisions (B)(1)(a) through (B)(1)(d) above, the City Council may pursue any
remedies available to it, pursuant to this chapter, or to the said franchise
agreement or ordinance or any other remedy, legal or equitable, available to
the City Council. In addition, the City Council may take action listed in
divisions (A)(2) through (A)(4) above.
   (C)   In the event that the franchisee dismantles or terminates the cable
communications system or is required by any provision of this chapter to
dismantle or terminate the cable communications system, the franchisee shall,
at the City Council’s direction, restore any property, public or private, to
the condition in which it existed prior to the erection or construction of the
system, including any improvements made to such properly subsequent to the
construction of the system. Restoration of city property, including, but not
limited to, streets, shall be in accordance with the directions and
specifications of the City Council and all applicable laws. The franchisee, at
the option and direction of the City Council, shall restore the same at its
expense.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.240)
§ 111.39 REVOCATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Any franchise issued hereunder may, after hearing, be revoked,
altered, or suspended by the City Council as it deems necessary on any of the
following grounds:
      (1)   For willful, false, or misleading statement in or material
omissions from any application;
      (2)   For failure to file and maintain the bonds required under this

right to revoke the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchisee
thereunder to any of the following events or for any of the following reasons:
         (a)   The franchisee shall, by act or omission, fail to comply with
any term or condition of this chapter and shall, within 30 days following
written demand by the City Council to effect such compliance, fail or refuse to
do so;
         (b)   Any provision of this chapter shall be finally adjudged by a

such provision constitutes at that time a consideration material to the
continuance of the franchise herein granted;

the purpose of enforcing any lien, whether judicial, execution, or otherwise;
is the subject debtor of an order for relief entered by a bankruptcy court; or
all or part of a franchisee’s facilities be sold under an instrument to secure
a debt and are not redeemed by franchisee within 30 days from said sale; or
         (d)   The franchisee attempts to or practices any fraud or deceit in
its conduct or relations under the franchise.
   (B)   No such revocation shall be effective unless or until the City Council
shall have adopted an ordinance setting forth the cause and reasons for the
revocation and the effective date thereof which ordinance shall not be adopted
without 30 days’ prior notice thereof to the franchisee and a full opportunity
offered to the franchisee to be heard upon the proposed adoption of said
ordinance. The franchisee shall not be declared in default or be subject to any
sanction under any provision of this chapter in any case in which the
performance of any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond its control.
(2008 Code, § 5.08.250)
§ 111.40 FORECLOSURE; RECEIVERSHIP.
   (A)   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial
part of the cable communications system, or upon the termination of any lease
covering all or a substantial part of the system, the franchisee shall notify
the City Council of such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a
notification that a change in control of the franchisee has taken place and the
provisions of this chapter governing the consent of the City Council to such
change in control of the franchisee shall apply.
   (B)   The City Council shall have the right to cancel this franchise 120
days after the appointment of a receiver, or trustee, to take over and conduct
the business of the franchisee, whether in receivership, reorganization,
bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or
trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days,
or unless:
      (1)   Within 120 days after his or her election or appointment, such

this subchapter which embodies all or part of an ordinance.
   PLANNING COMMISSION. The Louisville Metro Planning Commission.
(2008 Code, § 16.08.010)
§ 150.21 ENFORCEMENT OF BINDING ELEMENTS.
   The violation of any binding element, as defined herein, shall constitute a
civil offense which may subject the violator to a civil fine and/or other

§ 150.22 PLANNING COMMISSION; AUTHORITY.

offense under any provision of the Kentucky Revised Statutes, including,
specifically and without limitation, any provision of the state’s penal code
and any moving motor vehicle offense, such as a violation of a binding element,
shall not be a civil offense under this subchapter but a criminal offense which
may be prosecuted in the court of appropriate jurisdiction.
   (B)   In the exercise of its authority under this subchapter, the Planning
Commission shall have the power to:
      (1)   Adopt rules and regulations to govern its operation and conduct of
its hearing that are consistent with requirements of this subchapter;
      (2)   Conduct hearings to determine whether there has been a violation of
a binding element;
      (3)   Subpoena alleged violators, witnesses, and evidence to its hearings
and all such subpoenas issued by the Planning Commission may be served by any

Commission may administer such oaths to witnesses prior to their testimony
before the Planning Commission on any matter;
      (5)   Make findings and issue orders that are necessary to remedy any
violation of a binding element; and
      (6)   Impose civil fines as authorized in this subchapter on any person

be initiated by the issuance of a citation by a Land Use Enforcement Officer.
   (B)   When a Land Use Enforcement Officer, based upon personal observation
or investigation, has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of a binding
element has occurred, the Officer may issue a warning notice and citation to
the offender. Prior to issuing a citation, however, the Officer shall issue a
warning notice giving the offender ten days, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays
excluded, in which to remedy the violation. If the person to whom the notice is
given fails or refuses to remedy the violation within the specified time, the
Land Use Enforcement Officer may issue a citation. However, if the violation is
a threat to the public safety, the Land Use Enforcement Officer immediately
shall issue a citation without a prior warning notice.
   (C)   The citation issued by the Land Use Enforcement Officer shall be in a
form prescribed by the Planning Commission and shall contain, in addition to

fine or to contest the citation; and
      (9)   A statement that if the person fails to pay the civil fine set
forth in the citation or to contest the citation within the time allowed, the
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing before the
Planning Commission to contest the citation, and that the determination that a
violation was committed shall be final.
   (D)   All citations issued shall be hand-delivered to the alleged violator.
After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, the Land Use Enforcement
Officer shall notify the Planning Commission by delivering the citation to the
administrative official designated by the Planning Commission.
   (E)   When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is issued
shall respond to the citation within 14 days of the date the citation is issued
by either paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or requesting, in
writing, a hearing before the Planning Commission to contest the citation. If
the person fails to respond to the citation within 14 days, the person shall be
deemed to have waived the right to a hearing to contest the citation and the
determination that a violation was committed shall be considered final. In this
event, the Planning Commission shall enter a final order determining that the
violation was committed and imposing the civil fine set forth in the citation.
(2008 Code, § 16.08.040)
§ 150.24 HEARINGS BEFORE THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   (1)   When a hearing before the Planning Commission has been

requests or agrees to a continuance not to exceed 30 days. All continuances
must receive the approval of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Not less than seven days before the date set for the hearing, the
Planning Commission shall notify the person who requested the hearing of the
date, time, and place of the hearing. The notice may be given by certified
mail, return-receipt requested; by personal delivery; or by leaving the notice
at the person’s usual place of residence with an individual residing therein
who is 18 years of age or older and who is informed of the contents of the
notice.
      (3)   Any person requesting a hearing before the Planning Commission who
fails to appear at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to
have waived the right to a hearing to contest the citation and the
determination that a violation was committed shall be final. In this event, the
Planning Commission shall enter a final order determining that the violation
was committed and imposing the civil fine set forth in the citation.
   (B)   Each case before a Planning Commission shall be presented by an
attorney who shall be counsel to the Planning Commission.
   (C)   All testimony before the Planning Commission shall be under oath and
shall be recorded. The Planning Commission shall take testimony from the Land
Use Enforcement Officer, the alleged offender, and any witnesses to the alleged
violation offered by the Land Use Enforcement Officer or the alleged offender.
Formal rules of evidence shall not apply but fundamental due process shall be
observed and shall govern the proceedings.
   (D)   After the hearing, the Planning Commission shall determine, based on
the evidence presented, whether a violation was committed. When the Planning
Commission determines that no violation was committed, an order dismissing the
citation shall be entered. When the Planning Commission determines that a
violation has been committed, it shall issue an order upholding the citation
and may order the offender to pay a civil fine in an amount up to the maximum
authorized by this subchapter or may order the offender to remedy a continuing
violation within a specified time to avoid the imposition of a fine or both, as
authorized herein.
   (E)   Every final order of the Planning Commission shall be reduced to
writing, which shall include the date the order was issued and a copy of the
order shall be furnished to the person named in the citation. If the person
named in the citation is not present at the time a final order of the Planning
Commission is issued, the order shall be delivered to that person by certified
mail, return-receipt requested; by personal delivery; or by leaving a copy of
the order at that person’s usual place of residence with any individual
residing therein who is 18 years of age or older and who is informed of the
contents of the order.
(2008 Code, § 16.08.050)
§ 150.25 APPEAL OF PLANNING COMMISSION ORDERS.
   Any final order issued by the Planning Commission with respect to a citation
for the violation of a binding element may be appealed in conformity with KRS

§ 150.26 FINES; PAYMENT.
   The person or entity found to have committed a violation of a binding
element shall be responsible for the amount of all fines assessed for the
violation. The Planning Commission may file a civil action in its name against
the person or entity and shall have the remedies provided in KRS 100.415.
(2008 Code, § 16.08.070)

immediate action in the court of appropriate jurisdiction to remedy a violation
of a binding element when there is reason to believe that the existence of the
binding element violation presents a serious threat to the public health,
safety, and welfare, or if, in the absence of immediate action, the effects of
the binding element violation will be irreparable or irreversible.
(2008 Code, § 16.08.080)

150.27 shall be subject to a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $4,000
and shall comply with such remedial orders as may be issued by the Planning

addition to being of equivalent construction, an attaching structure must be
totally enclosed.
   HALF STORY. A top finished floor level without a vertical exterior wall on
the front of the building which contains less than 75% of the square footage
that the building footprint would accommodate. The exterior front wall of such
level would consist of sloped roofing which may or may not contain window

that are generally recognized as earth tones reflective of natural building
materials. Colors that are bright, attract attention, or not in harmony with
surroundings are not NEUTRAL COLORS.
   SQUARE FOOTAGE. In terms of a building, shall be calculated using the
exterior measurements of the building at each finished floor level, including
only finished spaces that are usable year-round. Exclude the SQUARE FOOTAGE of
any space that is not finished or heated like the main body of the house.
Exclude garage space even if finished and/or heated. Exclude finished basement
areas.
   ZONING. Except as may be specifically defined elsewhere in this subchapter,
means the zoning classification as set forth in the zoning district map for the
county; and zoning classification requirements and restrictions as set forth in
the Land Development Code; both of which may be found in the offices of the
Planning and Zoning Commission of Metro Louisville/the county.
(2008 Code, § 15.10.010)
§ 151.02 PRIMARY USE.
   (A)   No lot shall be used for any purpose other than that allowed by the
zoning for the county, as described in Chapter 155, latest addition.
   (B)   No structure of a temporary character shall be permitted on any lot
except temporary tool sheds or field offices used by a builder or developer,
which shall be removed within 30 days from the time when construction or
development is completed.
   (C)   No outbuilding, trailer, basement, tent, shack, garage, barn, or
structure other than the main residence erected on a lot shall be used as a
residence, temporarily or permanently.
(2008 Code, § 15.10.020) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.03 RESTRICTIONS THAT RUN WITH THE LAND.
   (A)   Nearly all properties within the city are covered by and were
developed in accordance with deeds of restrictions that are recorded in the
office of the County Clerk. The city reiterates and declares to be in full
force and effect all such regulations and restrictions on land use, buildings,
planning, and subdivision of lots.
   (B)   As part of all applications for a building permit, it shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to provide an affidavit certifying that the
proposed construction is in accordance with all deed restrictions on file with
the County Clerk. Such affidavit shall include reference to the deed book and
page number of the deed of restrictions.
   (C)   The city shall not knowingly issue a permit for any type of
construction, re-construction, remodeling, or subdivision that is inconsistent
with or violates a recorded deed restriction.
   (D)   In any instance where a deed restriction and a city requirement are
not the same, the more restrictive requirement shall take precedence.
(2008 Code, § 15.10.030)
§ 151.04 APPEARANCE.
   (A)   No building shall be constructed within the boundaries of the city
unless the character, style, and construction thereof shall be equal to and
consistent with the existing residences in the immediate area of proposed
building and unless the proposed building is suitable to the site and in
harmony with the surroundings. This provision includes grading, landscaping,
planting, trees, driveways, walks, screenings, and fences.
   (B)   Unless prevented by weather, the front and side yards of every lot
shall be finish graded and sodded prior to occupancy. When weather prevents
timely completion, this work shall be completed at the first available
opportunity. An appropriate portion of any construction bond may be withheld
until this work is completed, regardless of the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
   (C)   Upon construction of a new, primary building, where sidewalks adjacent
and parallel to the street exist on an abutting lot, a connecting sidewalk of
matching size and construction shall be provided on all streets which abut the
lot for the width of the lot.
(2008 Code, § 15.10.040) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.05 SQUARE FOOTAGE.
   The square footage of any proposed residence shall be equal to or greater
than the square footage of the smallest residential structure within the
immediate area. The maximum square footage of any proposed building may be
restricted by the requirements of §
151.04 regarding suitability to the site and surroundings. The maximum square
footage may also be restricted by the applicable zoning classification’s
maximum floor area ratio (FAR = total building square footage divided by total
lot square footage).
(2008 Code, § 15.10.050)
§ 151.06 LEVELS AND HEIGHTS.
   (A)   No building shall exceed two and one-half stories or 35 feet in
height. Height shall be measured from the level of the lowest finished grade on
the entire perimeter of the building to the highest roof peak.
   (B)   Any building level below the first floor and on, or wholly or
partially below the finished grade level (for example, a basement or crawl
space), shall not be counted as a story provided its exterior wall, wherever it
appears at the front of the building, does not extend more than 18 inches above
the finished grade there. If its exterior wall extends more than 18 inches
above the finished grade at the front of the building, but less than four feet
above the finished grade, it shall be counted as a half story. If its exterior

(Ord. 10-02, passed 1-6-2010)
INACTIVE CEMETERIES
§ 155.015 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      CEMETERY WITH UNDEFINED BOUNDARIES. Any cemetery or burial ground the
limits of which are not delineated on any map, in a written description in
wills or deeds, or by a wall or fence, or specific cemetery vegetation. This
term shall also apply to any burial site(s) where graves are discovered outside
of defined cemetery boundaries.
      INACTIVE CEMETERY. Any cemetery, private or family cemetery, church
cemetery, or historic or prehistoric burial ground not used for interment of
human remains within the last ten years.
   (B)   Note: The procedure for the removal and relocation of a cemetery is
set out in KRS 381.720-381.767.
(LDC § 4.4.6)
§ 155.016 REQUIREMENTS.
   A parcel of land on which an inactive cemetery is located or an adjacent
parcel of land may be used as allowed by the site’s zoning classification and
other applicable regulations, with the following additional restrictions.
   (A)   Preservation. All existing cemeteries and burial grounds shall be
preserved and maintained in accordance with applicable Kentucky Revised
Statutes, Kentucky Administrative Regulations, and federal laws and regulations
and state law. Relocation or removal of gravesites shall occur only as
specified in applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The
county’s Office of Historic Preservation and Archives shall be notified, in
writing, by supplying to the office copies of all state and local applications
and permits prior to the relocation procedure.
   (B)   Notification. The applicant shall notify the county’s Office of
Historic Preservation and Archives and the state’s Historical Society of the
location of any cemetery or burial ground prior to development or subdivision
of the parcel.
   (C)   Development. In preserving a cemetery while at the same time
developing a parcel, an applicant, property owner, or developer has the
following options:
      (1)   Transfer the existing cemetery as part of a buildable lot.
Ownership and maintenance of the cemetery shall be transferred to the
individual lot owner;
      (2)   Make the existing cemetery a separate lot permanently preserved
from development of structures or other non-cemetery improvements. Ownership
and maintenance of the cemetery shall be transferred by written agreement to
either a subdivision Homeowner’s Association, a local legislative unit, or a
historical organization. A legally created transfer agreement must be finalized
and executed, and a copy provided to the DPDS, within 90 days of any final
approval of a record plat or development plan. The Planning Commission or its
designee may grant up to two 30-day extensions for the execution of said
transfer agreement. Failure to execute the agreement or provide the copy may
render the final approval of a subdivision plan or district development plan
null and void; and
      (3)   The applicant shall inform the Planning Commission which of the
above listed options (division (C)(1) and (C)(2)) they choose to pursue prior
to approval of any development or subdivision.
   (D)   Building setbacks.
      (1)   For cemeteries with defined boundaries (such as a wall or fence),
all buildings and structures other than fences and walls shall be set back at
least 30 feet from the perimeter. Land disturbance within 30 feet of the
perimeter, except as described in division (F) below, shall not be allowed.
Prior to initiating any site disturbing activities and for the duration of the
site preparation and construction processes, the 30-foot buffer area shall be
delineated by installation of temporary fencing so as to be readily
identifiable.
      (2)   For cemeteries with undefined boundaries, the Commission may
require certification of a cemetery with undefined boundaries by an
archaeologist (as defined in 36 CFR Part 61). Documentation of acceptance of
the cemetery boundaries by the Historic Landmarks Commission or delegated staff
persons shall be provided for the Planning Commission and building permit
agency files prior to initiation of any site disturbance activities. After the
boundary has been approved, all buildings and structures other than fences and
walls shall be set back at least 30 feet, or another distance set by the
county’s Historic Landmarks Commission.
   (E)   Security. Existing cemetery fences and walls shall be maintained and
repaired. The property owner or developer is required to erect a new permanent
enclosure (if one does not exist) surrounding the cemetery. For cemeteries with
undefined boundaries, the location of the fence shall be established in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the county’s Historic Landmarks
Commission. The new permanent fence shall be made of a material compatible with
the character of the existing cemetery and surrounding residences. If a portion
of an original wall or fence remains and it is a compatible material (for
example, stone, brick, cast iron, wooden picket), the permanent fence or wall
shall be properly repaired using the same material. If the existing fence is an
inappropriate material (for example, barbed wire or farm fence), it shall be
replaced with a new fence of an appropriate material. Although the permanent
fence must be erected as soon as practical, a temporary fence must be erected
and maintained at all times during site development and construction. The
county’s Historic Landmarks Commission shall be responsible for determining the
appropriateness of materials.
   (F)   Maintenance. Existing cemetery planting or foliage shall be pruned and
generally left in its natural state. The county’s Historic Landmarks Commission
shall be responsible for determining the appropriateness of landscaping used in
and immediately surrounding all inactive cemeteries. Cemeteries shall be
maintained both during site development and after construction is complete in
accordance with Chapter 96 of the county’s Code of Ordinances.
   (G)   Access. Public access shall be provided and permanently maintained to
an existing cemetery with a minimum 15-foot recorded ingress-egress access
easement.
   (H)   Plans. A statement by the property owner, applicant, or developer
shall be made on the site plan or subdivision plan regarding permanent cemetery
ownership and maintenance. This information shall also be included on a final
plat for a subdivision if recorded after the effective date of this regulation.
   (I)   Deed. A deed restriction in a form approved by the Planning
Commission’s legal counsel shall be recorded acknowledging the location, site,
ownership, and maintenance of a cemetery.
   (J)   Yard requirements. No area occupied by graves may be counted toward
the area required for front, side, street-side, or rear yard requirements.
   (K)   Remains. If human remains are discovered during the excavation or
development of a site, the applicant shall immediately cease excavation
activities and notify the County Coroner and the county’s Historic Landmarks
Commission.

§ 155.033 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   General. Land disturbing activity occurring on or within an
environmentally constrained feature or within a buffer area associated with
such feature as established by this chapter, including any construction,
subdivision, clearing, or grading activities, unless exempted by §
155.030(B), shall be permitted only in compliance with regulations applicable
to said constrained feature.
   (B)   Standards for protection during construction. Site disturbance limits
shall be designated in the field prior to commencement of excavation, grading,
or construction with construction barrier fencing or other methods approved by
the DPDS. For trees and clumps of trees to be preserved within the site
disturbance limit, tree protection specifications, as required in §§
155.120 through
155.127, shall be followed.
(LDC § 4.6.4) Penalty, see §
155.999
DEVELOPMENT ON STEEP SLOPES
§ 155.045 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to guide development in steeply sloped or
unstable hillside areas consistent with the Cornerstone 2020 Comprehensive Plan
guidelines, to protect natural areas and features, and to locate development,
where possible, in areas that do not have severe environmental limitations.
This subchapter intends to regulate hillside development in order to protect
life and property from hazards due to slope, unstable soils, earth movement,
and other geologic and hydrologic hazards. More specifically, these regulations
are intended to:
   (A)   Maintain property values and avoid property damage due to development
of steep slopes and unstable soils;
   (B)   Incorporate current design, landscape architecture, architecture, and
civil engineering practices to preserve, enhance, and/or promote the stability
and environmental quality of hillside areas;
   (C)   Preserve or enhance the beauty of the landscape by encouraging the
maximum retention of natural topographic features, including slopes, ridge
lines, vistas, and natural plant communities;
   (D)   Promote a safe means of ingress and egress for vehicular and
pedestrian traffic to and within hillside areas while at the same time
minimizing the scarring effects of hillside street construction;
   (E)   Encourage imaginative and innovative building techniques to create
buildings suited to natural hillside surroundings; and
   (F)   Enhance neighborhood character and community identity associated with
the county’s hillsides.
(LDC § 4.7.1)
§ 155.046 APPLICABILITY; EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Applicability. This subchapter shall apply to all land disturbing
activity, including new development and subdivision, proposed on:
      (1)   Properties that contain slopes of 20% or greater (“steep slopes”);
or
      (2)   Properties that contain soils rated as “unstable” on Core Graphic
5.
   (B)   Land disturbing activity. Land disturbing activity includes the
following:
      (1)   Clearing of more than 5,000 square feet of forested area for
development;
      (2)   Grading, excavation, construction of foundations, footings or
retaining walls, or alteration of the ground surface, except for activities
defined as agricultural operations in KRS 224.71-100 through 224.71-140; and
      (3)   The installation of utilities, including, but not limited to,
water, sewer, natural gas, electric, telephone, and cable.
   (C)   Exemptions. This section shall not apply to the development activities
listed in §
155.030(B).
(LDC § 4.7.2)
§ 155.047 DEVELOPMENT ON STEEP SLOPES.
   (A)   The restrictions on development on sloped areas in this subchapter
refer to existing (pre-development) site conditions. Slopes shall be determined
by dividing the horizontal run of the slope into the vertical rise of the same
slope and converting the result into a percentage value.
   (B)   Steepness of a slope shall be measured from the points with the
highest and lowest elevation between slope breaks. The Planning Director in
consultation with NRCS representatives shall make the final determination of
what constitutes a slope break.
(LDC § 4.7.3)
§ 155.048 LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY ON UNSTABLE SOILS.
   Land disturbing activity on unstable soils (as depicted on Core Graphic 5)
is permitted only in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and in keeping with
the following.
   (A)   The Planning Commission determines the proposed construction cannot be
accommodated on a portion of the site that does not contain unstable soils.
   (B)   The application for the land disturbing activity includes a
geotechnical survey report, prepared in accordance with best practices. For
land disturbing activity in conjunction with a plan review (preliminary
subdivision plan, development plan, conditional use plan, and the like)
required by this chapter, a geotechnical report shall be submitted with the
application for the required review. Such survey will ordinarily include
information obtained by drilling, locating of bedrock, and testing of soils for
shear strength. The report shall be prepared by a licensed and state-registered
professional engineer, practicing in accordance with KRS 322, and whose area of
expertise includes geotechnical engineering. In order for the proposed
construction to be approved, the report must:
      (1)   Conclude the proposed disturbance and/or construction can be
carried out in a manner that will minimize impact on the slope and will not
adversely impact foundation stability on the subject property and surrounding
properties;
      (2)   Conclude that stable foundations can be constructed on the site and
identify the mitigation measures and construction practices, including
construction supervision, necessary to assure the stability of buildings and
foundations to be constructed on the site; and
      (3)   Include erosion and sediment control measures necessary to assure
compliance with
Chapter 156.
   (C)   The applicant provides a plan, acceptable to the Commission, that
specifies how the mitigation measures and construction practices, including
construction supervision, necessary to assure the stability of buildings and
foundations to be constructed on the site as recommended in the geotechnical
report will be implemented.
   (D)   Prior to requesting a full building permit, the applicant shall
provide certification from a professional engineer, having the qualifications
described in division (B) above, that site preparation and foundation
construction were carried out in accordance with the approved mitigation
measures and construction practices.
   (E)   Prior to requesting a certificate of occupancy for any structure on
the site, the applicant shall provide certification from a geotechnical soils
engineer certifying that land disturbance and construction were carried out in
accordance with the mitigation measures and construction practices, including
inspections, set forth in the geotechnical report.
   (F)   Prior to site disturbance, the applicant shall submit a bond of
sufficient amount to cover the cost of site stabilization.
(LDC § 4.7.4) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.049 LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY ON SLOPES GREATER THAN 20%.
   (A)   Land disturbing activity on slopes greater than 20% is permitted on
lots existing prior to the effective date of this regulation and on lots
created by minor plats submitted for review after the effective date of this
regulation, only if the activity is in keeping with the Comprehensive Plan and
the proposed activity complies with the following standards.
      (1)   The Planning Director finds that the design and configuration of
the development results in the minimum disturbance of slopes greater than 20%
necessary to accommodate the proposed use of the site.
      (2)   Compatible on-site utilities (electric, phone, cable) are placed in
a common trench.
      (3)   Shared access driveways serving single-family residences are used
when this technique reduces pavement and grading of steep areas.
   (B)   Land disturbing activities on slopes greater than 20% are permitted on
lots created by major subdivision after the effective date of this regulation
only if the activity is in keeping with the Comprehensive Plan and the proposed
activity complies with the following standards.
      (1)   The Commission finds that the design and configuration of the
development results in the minimum disturbance of slopes greater than 20%
necessary to accommodate the proposed use of the site.
      (2)   Compatible on-site utilities (electric, phone, cable) are placed in
a common trench.
      (3)   (a)   Land disturbing activities on slopes greater than 20% and
less than 30% shall be required to prepare a geotechnical survey report if the
staff of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service determines such a
study is warranted, given the site’s soil and geologic characteristics. A
geotechnical report shall be submitted for land disturbing activities on slopes
greater than 30%. The geotechnical survey report shall be submitted with the
application for land disturbing activities and with the application for a plan
review (preliminary subdivision plan, development plan, conditional use plan,
and the like) required by this chapter and shall be prepared in accordance with
best practices. Such survey will ordinarily include information obtained by
drilling, locating of bedrock, and testing of soils for shear strength. The
report shall be prepared by a licensed and state-registered professional
engineer practicing in accordance with KRS 322 and whose area of expertise
includes geotechnical engineering. The report shall include mitigation measures
as needed to ensure stability and minimize environmental impact during site
preparation and construction phases of the regulated activity. In addition, the
report shall include erosion and sediment control measures necessary to assure
compliance with
Chapter 156.
         (b)   The Planning Commission may approve the activity if the report
opines and demonstrates that:
            1.   The slope’s ground surface and subsurface are not unstable;
            2.   Development of the slope and associated mitigation measures
will not increase the degree of risk of slope instability both on-site and on
adjacent lands; and
            3.   If a geotechnical report is required, the applicant provides a
plan, acceptable to the Commission, that specifies how the mitigation measures
and construction practices, including construction supervision, necessary to
assure the stability of buildings and foundations to be constructed on the site
as recommended in the geotechnical report will be implemented.
(LDC § 4.7.5) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.050 INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF GEOTECHNICAL SURVEY REPORT.
   The Planning Commission may, on recommendation of the Natural Resource
Conservation Service or the MSD or the Planning Director, require an
independent review of the submitted geotechnical survey report. Such review
shall be conducted by a licensed and state-registered professional engineer
practicing in accordance with KRS 322 and whose area of expertise includes
geotechnical engineering. The reasonable cost of such review shall be borne by
the applicant.
(LDC § 4.7.6)
§ 155.051 DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL TRANSFER ALLOWED.
   (A)   Major subdivision development proposals submitted after the effective
date of this regulation and which permanently preserve areas of the site with
slopes greater than 20% may transfer the development potential (building sites
or floor area) of the permanently preserved area to the remainder of the site
subject to the following limitations.
      (1)   The subdivision is not being developed under the “Alternative
Development Incentives” of the Land Development Code.
      (2)   Areas to be permanently preserved are preserved in a manner
acceptable to the Commission (for example, conservation easement, common open
space, and the like).
      (3)   The area of the site to which development potential is being
transferred is at least as large as the area from which development potential
is being transferred (for example, if an applicant wishes to transfer
development potential from three acres, the portion of the site to which
development is shifted must be at least three acres).
      (4)   All lots in the proposed development meet the minimum alternative
development incentive lot size of the applicable form district.
      (5)   All lots in the proposed development meet the height, yard, and
setback requirements of the applicable form district.
   (B)   The maximum development potential allowable for transfer shall be
determined by one of the following methods:
      (1)   One-half of the theoretical development potential based on the
number of acres preserved and the existing zoning of the area to be preserved
(for example, if three acres of an R-4 site is proposed for protection, then
seven building sites could be transferred to other portions of the same
property: 3ac x 4.84 units/acre/2 = 7.26 units); or
      (2)   The realistic development potential determined by an engineered
development plan including a preliminary geotechnical feasibility study and
meeting all other requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Note: Although lot sizes are reduced, setbacks are not reduced for
density transfer lots. Consistent appearance throughout the subdivision is
intended.

their associated riparian areas provide in the county;
   (B)   To guide development on sites with environmental constraints
consistent with the Cornerstone 2020 Comprehensive Plan;
   (C)   To locate development, where possible, in areas that do not have
severe environmental limitations and to protect natural areas and features as a
part of development planning, by designating buffer areas that will guide
future development adjacent to protected waterways;
   (D)   To minimize water pollution, including sediment and other pollutants
in surface runoff; to promote bank stabilization; to protect riparian wetlands
and their wildlife habitats;
   (E)   Generally, to promote land use policies which will maintain or improve
water quality levels; and
   (F)   To implement the goals of the Clean Water Act.
(LDC § 4.8.1)
§ 155.066 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Applicability. Unless exempt by division (B)(2) below, this subchapter
shall apply to any land disturbing activity and to all new subdivisions,
including the expansion or reconstruction of buildings and impervious surface

minimum necessary to accommodate the proposed use; and
      (5)   Docks, boat launches, structures which accommodate public water
supply intake, water quality treatment plant sewer lines and outfalls, and
other uses which, owing to their water dependent nature, cannot be located
anywhere but within a designated buffer area.
(LDC § 4.8.2)
§ 155.067 ESTABLISHMENT OF BUFFER AREAS AND THEIR BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Applicability. Buffer areas shall be established along protected
waterways, which shall include the following waterways:

public hearing and recommend candidates for designation to the legislative
body/bodies with jurisdictional control which shall have final designation
authority.
         (b)   Buffer areas are established by this subchapter along all
protected waterways located in the county, except that more restrictive buffer
areas established in special districts, pursuant to Chapter 3 of the Land
Development Code, supersede the requirements of this subchapter.
   (B)   Approval required. Specific and final buffer area boundary
delineations shall be determined by the Planning Director or designee.
   (C)   The minimum buffer area requirements established by this subchapter
for water bodies other than wetlands are either:
      (1)   The minimum width as set forth in the table below. Type A buffer
areas and the streamside zone of Type B buffer areas are measured from the top
of the bank of the protected stream; and/or
      (2)   The alternative buffer width and design, approved by the USDA
Natural Resources Conservation Service; provided it meets the agency’s
standards and specifications for riparian buffers. Sites located in form
districts otherwise subject to Type B buffer requirement (see table below) are
eligible for alternative buffer widths at the applicant’s discretion.
          Buffer area type and minimum buffer area width (feet) by form district
         Type “A” buffer area applies in the following form Type “B” buffer area applies in the following form
         districts:                                             districts:

   (D)   Note: In general, lakes formed by impoundment of streams are subject
to this regulation.
(LDC § 4.8.3)
§ 155.068 MODIFICATIONS OR VARIANCES OF BUFFER AREA BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Permitted minor modifications from buffer area requirements. A 25%
reduction in the buffer width is permitted on a portion of the property if it
is offset by an increase of the buffer width on an equal or greater portion of
the same property with the result that the average buffer area width for the
property is equal to or greater than that specified in the table in § 115.067.
   (B)   Variances - additional criteria. Buffer area requirements are
dimensional requirements with respect to which variances may be requested as
specified in KRS 100.243. In addition to the applicable criteria for variances
provided by statute, the following factors may be considered in such a variance
request.
      (1)   The variance is necessary because the requirements of this section
represent an extreme hardship such that minimal or no reasonable economic use
of the land is available without reducing the width of the required buffer
area.
      (2)   The size, shape, or topography of the property, as of March 1,
2003, is such that it is not possible to construct a single-family detached
dwelling without encroaching into the required buffer area.
      (3)   Encroachment into the required buffer area shall be limited to the
minimum necessary to accommodate the proposed use.
      (4)   The applicant shall commit, to the satisfaction of the county, to
mitigation measures that substantially offset any potential adverse impacts of
the proposed encroachment during site preparation, construction, and post-
construction.
      (5)   Approval of the variance will not result in a reduction in water
quality.
(LDC § 4.8.4)
§ 155.069 WETLANDS DELINEATION AND PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Delineation of wetland boundaries.
      (1)   Mapped wetlands. Boundary delineation of wetlands shall be
established using hydric soils as a preliminary indicator of wetlands that may
meet jurisdictional requirements.
      (2)   Disputed wetlands. If a wetlands has not been mapped or its
boundaries not clearly established or if either the county or applicant dispute
the existing boundaries, the applicant shall retain a qualified person with
demonstrated expertise in the field to delineate the boundaries of the wetland
in keeping with the standards specified in the Corps of Engineers Wetlands
Delineation Manual, Technical Report Y-87-1 (January 1987). Subsequent
revisions of the Delineation Manual shall not be incorporated into this
delineation methodology.
   (B)   Compliance with applicable federal wetlands laws or regulations.
      (1)   Prohibited activities. No person shall engage in any activity that
shall disturb, remove, fill, drain, dredge, clear, destroy, or alter any area,
including vegetation, within a wetlands that falls in the jurisdiction of the
federal government and its agencies, except as may be expressly allowed under
applicable federal laws or regulations. Draining any wetland that falls in the
jurisdiction of the federal government and its agencies is prohibited except in
keeping with the provisions of division (B)(2) below.
      (2)   Federal approvals prerequisite to county approval. The county shall
not grant final approval to any land disturbing activity, development, or
subdivision in a wetlands that falls within the federal government’s
jurisdiction until the applicant demonstrates that all necessary federal
approvals and permits have been obtained.
   (C)   Wetland buffer width and use restrictions.
      (1)   Width. Wetland buffer areas shall be at least 25 feet in width. The
total width and design shall conform with USDA Natural Resources Conservation
Service criteria, but shall not exceed 100 feet.
      (2)   Permitted uses and activities. Uses shall be as specified in §
155.070.
(LDC § 4.8.5) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.070 STANDARDS FOR PROTECTED WATERWAYS AND ALL BUFFER AREAS.
   (A)   General rule. No land-disturbing activity, development, or subdivision
of any type shall occur in a protected waterway or buffer area, except as
expressly allowed in this subchapter and other applicable county, state, or
federal laws and regulations. The county shall not approve any land-disturbing
activity, development, or subdivision until the applicant obtains all other
necessary county, state, and/or federal permits. All buffer areas shall remain
in a vegetated, natural state and shall not be modified in any manner except as
expressly allowed in this section. Plant material adequate for filtering
surface drainage shall be maintained within all buffer areas.
   (B)   Permitted uses and activities in the 100-year floodplain. Any land
disturbing activity, development, or subdivision in the 100-year floodplain
shall demonstrate compliance with the county’s Floodplain Ordinance, as
amended.
   (C)   Uses permitted in the type a buffer areas and the streamside buffer
zone. Within a Type A buffer area and the streamside zone of a Type B buffer
area, allowable uses and activities are restricted to:
      (1)   Public flood control structures;
      (2)   Utility rights-of-way (Type A buffer only);
      (3)   Pedestrian-only trails; and

activities within the middle zone of a Type B buffer area are restricted to:
      (1)   Utility rights-of-way;
      (2)   Biking or hiking trails;
      (3)   Stormwater management and sediment control facilities approved by
the MSD; and
      (4)   Recreational uses that entail no impervious surfaces, or are
approved by the Planning Commission.
   (E)   Uses prohibited in the outer buffer zone. The following uses and
activities are not allowed within the outer zone of a Type B buffer area:
      (1)   Septic systems; and
      (2)   Permanent structures or impervious surface coverage with a
footprint of greater than 100 square feet with the exception of approved
recreational trails.
   (F)   Wetlands and alternative Type B buffers. The first 25 feet of wetland
and alternative buffers shall meet the use restrictions established for the
streamside buffer zone (division (C) above). For buffers less than 50 feet in
width, the balance of the buffer area shall meet the middle buffer zone
restrictions (division (D) above). For buffers more than 50 feet in width, one-
half the width outside the first 25 feet may be used in accordance with the
middle buffer zone restrictions and one-half may be used in accordance with the
outer buffer zone restrictions.
   (G)   Location of platted lots in buffers areas.
      (1)   (a)   Any lot contained within a preliminary subdivision plat and
intended for development shall be platted outside Type A buffer areas and
outside the streamside and middle zones of all Type B buffer areas.
         (b)   The prohibition on development lots in this section shall not
preclude the designation of the buffer area as a tract of land within the
preliminary and final plats related to such real property; provided there is a
plat note on such preliminary and final plat that references that the buffer
area is subject to the terms and conditions of this subchapter and that the
buffer area tracts are clearly identified as non-buildable tracts.
      (2)   Note: The application of pesticides and herbicides within Type A
and the first 75 feet of Type B buffer areas is strongly discouraged.
   (H)   Prohibited uses and activities in buffer areas. The following uses and
activities are prohibited in all buffer areas because of their proven potential
for water pollution:
      (1)   Storage of hazardous substances and fertilizers;
      (2)   Above or below ground petroleum storage facilities;
      (3)   Drain fields from on-site sewage disposal and treatment system
(i.e., septic systems);

      (8)   Land application of biosolids; and
      (9)   Filling and/or excavation activities other than those attendant to
uses specifically authorized.
   (I)   Recreation, education, or scientific activities allowed. Structures
and improvements for recreational, educational, or scientific activities,
including, but not limited to, fishing access and wildlife management and
viewing, may be permitted in a buffer area; provided, a management plan that
establishes long-term protection of the buffer area is submitted with the final
plat or plan and is approved by the county.
   (J)   Stream and buffer area crossings: roads, bridges, trails, and
utilities. Roads, bridges, trails, and utilities are permitted in a buffer area
and may cross the protected waterway, subject to the Planning Commission’s
approval based on the recommendations of the Public Works and the DPDS and the
MSD.
      (1)   The applicant shall restore any disturbance of the buffer area and
protected waterway by re-grading and re-vegetation. See division (K) below for
applicable standards. Provisions for restoration of the disturbed area shall be
included in any development or subdivision agreement for the project with
adequate security to guarantee that the restoration will be completed.
      (2)   The right-of-way shall be the minimum width necessary for
installation, access, and maintenance.
      (3)   Access for maintenance of utilities in buffer areas should be at
specific points rather than parallel to the utility corridor.
      (4)   The angle of any crossings shall be perpendicular to the protected
waterway or buffer area in order to minimize clearing and other land
disturbance, unless the Planning Commission finds, based on comments from the
MSD, the Public Works Department, or the Planning Director, that a
perpendicular alignment is not feasible.
      (5)   The number of road crossings shall be the minimum number necessary
to provide for adequate transportation connections as required in this chapter.
      (6)   No more than one fairway crossing associated with a permitted golf
course use shall be allowed for every 1,000 linear feet of buffer area.
      (7)   Trench crossings of rock streambeds visible through the water
column or exposed on a seasonal basis shall be restored to a natural appearance
using grouting techniques.
      (8)   Plans for the crossing submitted with the application shall
identify the alignment of the crossing, the proposed construction techniques,
the proposed construction and working easements, and mobilization, staging, and
temporary disposal areas.
   (K)   Restoration. At the time of development, the following restoration
standards shall be met.
      (1)   Restoration required to stabilize banks. Riparian vegetation shall
be planted, as necessary, to stabilize the banks of a protected waterway within
a buffer area. Where a bank is denuded of its vegetation due to erosion, slope
failure, or similar occurrence, appropriate vegetation shall be planted to
quickly establish a vegetative cover, and then replanted with riparian
vegetation to ensure the long-term stabilization of the bank. Restoration
plantings shall be selected from the MSD native species restoration
specifications.
      (2)   Restoration of eroded banks required. Where stream bank erosion has
occurred as a result of on-site development activities, riparian vegetation
shall be planted to stabilize the stream bank unless the county determines such
vegetation would be inadequate to re-stabilize the bank. In instances where the
county determines that planting of riparian vegetation is inadequate to
stabilize the stream bank, alternate methods of stabilization approved by the
county shall be utilized.
      (3)   Other restoration allowed. Stream, stream bank, and vegetation
restoration projects are allowed where the goal is to restore the protected
waterway, wetlands, or buffer area to an ecologically healthy state, as
approved by the MSD.
   (L)   Water quality monitoring allowed. Water quality monitoring and stream
gauging are allowed within the protected waterway and buffer area, as approved
by the DPDS or by the MSD.
   (M)   Tree and vegetation removal.
      (1)   Existing, healthy trees and vegetation within a buffer area shall
be preserved.
      (2)   This provision shall not prohibit any of the following;
         (a)   Removal of dead or diseased trees/vegetation (provided a live
root system stays intact);
         (b)   Removal of noxious weeds;
         (c)   Removal of non-native trees/vegetation that threaten native
species growth or reintroduction;
         (d)   Removal of fallen trees, tree limbs, brush, and similar debris
that accumulate naturally in river/stream beds and that impede river/stream
flow;
         (e)   Removal of any other tree/vegetation that is a threat to the
public health or safety; or
         (f)   Removal of trees as part of an approved plan for stream side
recreation or access (for example, pedestrian trail) or as part of an approved
utility or road construction project.
(LDC § 4.8.6)
§ 155.071 CREDIT FOR OPEN SPACE.
   All protected waterway and their buffer areas shall count as open space for
the purposes of Chapter 10, Part 5 “Open Space Standards” of the Land
Development Code.
(LDC § 4.8.7)
DEVELOPMENT ON KARST TERRAIN
§ 155.085 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CAVE DRIPLINE. The beginning of a cave, defined as a line on the ground at a
cave entrance, formed by drips from the rock above at the outermost point of
the entrance’s overhang.
   CLOSED DEPRESSION. A karst geologic feature; a distinct bowl-shaped
depression in the land surface; size and amplitude are variable; drainage is
internal. Naturally occurring closed surface depressions found within karst
landscapes are called SINKHOLES (see below).
   GEOLOGIC FORMATION. The basic or fundamental rock stratigraphic unit in the
local classification of rocks, consisting of a body of rock (usually a
sedimentary stratum or strata but also igneous or metamorphic), generally
characterized by some degree of internal lithologic homogeneity or distinctive
lithologic features (such as chemical composition, structures, textures, gross
aspect of fossils, or time of deposition); typically used for mapping the
geology of an area.
   GEOLOGIC MEMBER. A rock stratigraphic unit which is subordinate (a subject)
of a formation; this unit is not necessarily mappable and is usually a unified
subdivision of local extent that may or may not be contained in more than one
formation.
   GROUNDWATER DRAINAGE BASIN. An area of the landscape that drains through the
subsurface to a spring or other component of a karst drainage system such as a
cave stream of karst window. This term is analogous to CATCHMENT for surface
drainage systems, in which case it denotes an area of the landscape that drains
to a river confluence or other point in a surface drainage system. In contrast
to surface CATCHMENTS, karst GROUNDWATER DRAINAGE BASINS generally cannot be
determined by topographic maps, and thus must be delineated by other methods,
primarily dye tracing.
   EPHEMERAL LAKE. A body of standing water occurring in a sinkhole of a karst
region that is usually visible after sufficient precipitation has occurred.
They may form from slow permeability of soils, rises in the water table, or the
development of a natural liner of slow permeable clays or soils.
   KARST. A terrain, generally underlain by limestone or dolomite, in which the
topography is chiefly formed by the dissolving of rock and which may be
characterized by sinkholes, sinking streams, subterranean drainage, and caves.
   KARST FEATURE BUFFER. A buffer area around a sinkhole collapse feature, the
extent of which is established in the field by a licensed geotechnical
engineer. The purpose of the BUFFER is to minimize the exposure of impervious
surfaces such as structures to sinkhole subsidence.
   KARST GEOLOGIC FEATURES. Geologic features that develop on karst terrain.
Examples of KARST GEOLOGIC FEATURES are sinkholes, caves, sinking streams, and
karst springs.
   KARST SPRING. The discharge points for underground streams.
   KARST SURVEY. A survey of property located within karst prone areas of the
county, as depicted on the karst prone areas map. The survey of a property
within this area is required prior to development review.
   SINKHOLE. Any closed depression in soil or bedrock formed by the erosion and
transport of earth material from below the land surface, which is circumscribed
by a closed topographic contour and drains to the subsurface. The SINKHOLE
boundary is described as an area bounded by a projected line demarcating a
change in slope from toward the center of the sinkhole to away from the
sinkhole which represents a local drainage divide. Precipitation falling on the
surface sloping toward the sinkhole is likely to run into the sinkhole throat
or infiltrate the soil and move through subsoil conduits to the throat. This
includes areas which contribute surface water to a SINKHOLE via streams.
   SINKHOLE COLLAPSE FEATURE. Sometimes called COVER COLLAPSE SINKHOLE, a
relatively steep-side, “throat-like” sinkhole typically within a larger
sinkhole and typically with rock or soil walls formed by the erosion and
transport of earth materials into the subsurface in a manner such that the
expression of this transport has propagated to the surface.
   SINKHOLE WATERSHED. An area bounded by a projected line demarcating a change
in slope from toward the center of the sinkhole to away from the sinkhole which
represents a local drainage divide. Precipitation failing on the surface
sloping toward the sinkhole is likely to run into the sinkhole throat or
infiltrate the soil and move through subsoil conduits to the throat. This
includes areas which contribute surface water to a sinkhole via streams.
   SINKING STREAM SINKPOINT. The location where a surface stream disappears
into the subsurface karst aquifer, either at a discrete point such as a cave
entrance, or gradually along the reach of a stream channel.
   STRATIGRAPHIC UNIT. A stratum or body of strata recognized as a unit in the
classification of the rocks of the earth’s crust with respect to any specific
rock character, property, attribute, or for purposes such as description,
mapping, and correlation.
(LDC § 4.9)
§ 155.086 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to guide development in karst
terrain areas consistent with the Cornerstone 2020 Comprehensive Plan
guidelines, to protect natural areas and features, and to locate development,
where possible, in areas that do not have severe environmental limitations. The
intent of this subchapter is to regulate karst terrain development in order to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare by regulating the development
and use of environmentally constrained lands to proceed in a manner that
promotes safe and appropriate construction, stormwater management, and
groundwater quality.
   (B)   More specifically, these regulations are intended to:
      (1)   Maintain property values and avoid property damage and/or safety
concerns due to development in karst terrain areas;
      (2)   Incorporate geotechnical engineering practices to promote the
stability and environmental quality of karst terrain areas;
      (3)   Preserve or enhance the beauty of the landscape by encouraging the
retention of natural topographic features, including sinkholes, springs, caves,
and natural plant communities;
      (4)   Protect groundwater by minimizing pollution caused by development
on karst terrain;
      (5)   Protect downstream development from flooding caused or exacerbated
by development activity in karst terrain areas; and

driveways) over sinkholes and springs in accordance with the following
requirement: The applicant shall obtain the services of an engineer
(geotechnical engineer) licensed in the state with experience in the review and
analysis of karst geologic features, practicing in accordance with KRS 322 to
conduct a geological assessment report to recommend treatment and construction
method. The Planning Director or designee may confer with other appropriate
agencies (USGS (U.S. Geological Survey), KGS (state’s Geological Survey),
Hoffman Environmental Research Institute (Western Kentucky University), NRCS
(National Resource Conservation Service), and MSD (Metropolitan Sewer
District)) in determining the significance of the feature(s) in question as
well as the appropriateness of the proposed treatment. If the proposed
treatment and construction method is approved then the licensed geotechnical
engineer shall be on the construction site to observe and verify that the
correct treatment was applied during construction. The licensed geotechnical
engineer shall submit a letter to Planning and Design Services stating that the
approved treatment method was applied.
   (B)   The following standards apply to sinkhole collapse features (including
sinking stream sink-point and cave entrances):
      (1)   The Planning Director or designee may approve the construction of
impervious surfaces (such as structures, parking areas, and driveways) with the
exception of principal residential structures over sinkhole collapse features
in accordance with the following requirement: The applicant shall obtain the
services of an engineer (geotechnical engineer) licensed in the state with
experience in the review and analysis of karst geologic features, practicing in
accordance with KRS 322, to conduct a geological assessment report to recommend
treatment and construction method. The Planning Director or designee may confer
with other appropriate agencies (USGS (U.S. Geological Survey), KGS (state’s
Geological Survey), Hoffman Environmental Research Institute (Western Kentucky
University), NRCS (National Resource Conservation Service), and MSD
(Metropolitan Sewer District)) in determining the significance of the feature
(s) in question as well as the appropriateness of the proposed treatment. If
the proposed treatment and construction method is approved, then the licensed
geotechnical engineer shall be on the construction site to observe and verify
that the correct treatment was applied during construction. The licensed
geotechnical engineer shall submit a letter to Planning and Design Services
stating that the approved treatment method was applied; and
      (2)   Where sinkhole collapse features are retained the applicant’s
engineer (geotechnical engineer) licensed in the state with experience in the
review and analysis of karst geologic features, practicing in accordance with
KRS 322, shall determine the appropriate karst feature buffer based on their
analysis of the particular collapse feature. At a minimum, this analysis shall
take into account surrounding evidence of instability such as surrounding soil
subsidence. The karst feature buffer shall be measured starting from the last
closed contour line of the sinkhole collapse feature or from the downstream-
most point of the sinking stream, or from the cave entrance dripline as
determined in the field by the applicant’s licensed engineer or geologist. The
filling of sinkhole collapse features may be approved by the Planning Director
or designee based on an approved filing method designed by the applicant’s
engineer (geotechnical engineer) licensed in the state with experience in the
review and analysis of karst geologic features, practicing in accordance with
KRS 322. No activities are permitted within the karst feature buffer except for
regular maintenance of landscaping. Buffers located downslope of construction
areas shall be physically screened with soil erosion and sediment controls
approved by the MSD. The buffer shall include ground cover and tree plantings
as follows.
         (a)   Trees listed on the preferred planting list (see §
155.178) may be planted within the buffer with approval from the Planning
Commission staff landscape architect.

Sewer District, that there will be no increase in soil erosion and sediment
pollution directed toward any cave entrance, sinkpoint of a perennial or
intermittent sinking stream, or sinkhole collapse feature.
      (3)   Stormwater drainage from a land use that stores, manufacturers,
processes, or distributes hazardous or potentially hazardous materials shall
not be directed toward a sinkhole.
      (4)   Stormwater drainage from streets, parking lots, loading and
unloading areas, and fuel service stations shall not be directed toward a
sinkhole unless the water is pretreated prior to entry into a sinkhole or the
drainage is part of a low impact development (LID) plan approved by the MSD for
the site.
   (D)   If utilities are to be constructed within a sinkhole, the utilities
shall be so constructed so as not to permit the flow of water along the utility
line trench, and shall be imperviously diked at 30-foot intervals.

(LDC § 10.1.1)
§ 155.121 APPLICABILITY AND BASIS OF CALCULATION.
   (A)   The requirements of this section shall apply to all new residential
subdivisions creating more than five buildable lots and to all new multi-family
and non-residential development. New single-family residential construction
shall provide tree(s) in accordance with the residential design standards found
within Chapter 5.
   (B)   Expansion or reconstruction of an existing non-residential building or
development shall be subject to the requirements of this section as follows:
      (1)   Any development site on which there is an increase in building area
or impervious surface area by more than 50% or where a structure has been
demolished and a new structure has been built in its place shall fully comply
with the tree canopy requirements set forth in this section.
      (2)   Any development site on which there is an increase in building area
or impervious surface area by more than 20% and less than 50% shall provide
one-half the tree canopy required by this section.
      (3)   Any development site on which there is an increase in building area
or impervious surface area by 20% or less shall not be required to provide the
tree canopy required by this part.
   (C)   (1)   The requirements of this section shall apply to the entire area
shown on a development plan and the required canopy may be equally distributed
throughout that area or be concentrated in certain parts or portions of that
area.
      (2)   Note: This provision allows residential subdivisions and multi-lot
commercial developments to group trees in clusters throughout the development
rather than meeting the canopy requirements on a lot-by-lot basis.
(LDC § 10.1.2)
§ 155.122 ALTERNATIVE FOR COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The tree canopy requirements of this section may be satisfied at the
applicant’s discretion by any combination of the following means:
      (1)   Preservation of existing trees or tree stands on the development
site;
      (2)   Planting new trees on the development site or as street trees on
adjacent rights-of-way; and/or
      (3)   Planting new trees on an alternative site approved by the Planning
Commission, at the applicant’s expense.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may approve an alternative site for the
planting of an equivalent number/amount of trees that meets any one of the
following criteria:
      (1)   A site within a public park approved by the Metropolitan Parks
Department;
      (2)   A site on a public road right-of-way, not adjacent to the
development site, approved by the Director of Works or by the appropriate state
or federal official in the event that the site is on a state or federal road;
      (3)   A privately developed site upon which affordable housing has been
constructed or is to be constructed; and/or
      (4)   A site of existing development where the Planning Commission finds
that additional tree canopy would be in the public interest. In any such case,
the Planning Commission may condition its approval of an alternative site upon
the agreement of the applicant to plant a tree or trees of a type that is
deemed appropriate for the site. It should be noted that using an alternative
site to meet the tree canopy requirements is an option available to developers
that must be approved by the Planning Commission. In no case shall the Planning
Commission require the off-site planting of trees to meet the requirements of
this section.
(LDC § 10.1.3)
§ 155.123 TREE CANOPY STANDARDS.
   (A)   The tree canopy on a development site shall meet the applicable
standards according to the site’s form district, proposed land use, and the
amount of tree preservation, as set forth in the tables below. (Percentages

   (D)   Any tree preserved or planted to meet the minimum requirements of this
section shall be maintained in healthy condition and shall be replaced if it
becomes diseased or dies.
   (E)   The Planning Director may require that any trees and/or tree stands
preserved to meet the requirements of this subchapter be inspected and found to
be healthy and free of disease by a certified arborist or registered landscape
architect if, upon inspection of the site, he or she or his or her designee
sees evidence that indicates that some or all of said trees may be unhealthy
and may not be appropriate for preservation.
   (F)   All new trees proposed to meet the requirements of this section shall
be planted within six months of the completion of the development. When a
development is to be completed in phases, trees shall be provided for each
phase as determined appropriate by the Planning Director.
   (G)   When trees are planted off-site or on private property to meet the
requirements of this section, the applicant shall provide the Planning Director
with documentation that sufficient measures have been taken to ensure the
preservation and, when necessary, the replacement of said trees. Examples of
such measures would include, but not be limited to, preservation and
replacement provisions in a subdivision’s deed of restrictions or within a
development’s binding elements or by placing all of the required trees within a
conservation easement or a woodland protection area (WPA).
   (H)   (1)   Note: All reductions shall be based on the total square feet of
tree canopy needed on a site to meet the requirements of the tables in division
(A) above.
      (2)   Note: These reductions in the tree canopy requirements have been
created in an effort to support a more compact and efficient urban form and to
support infill development opportunities.
      (3)   Note: Any trees or tree stands that are being preserved to meet the
minimum requirements of this section shall also be subject to the requirements
of §§
155.165 through
155.179.
(LDC § 10.1.4)
§ 155.124 CALCULATION.
   (A)   Any development site greater than two acres in size shall be permitted
to determine the area of existing tree canopy coverage to be preserved by
ground checking, aerial analysis, or any other method determined to be accurate
by the DPDS staff. If ground checking is utilized, then each individual tree
(i.e., a tree not grouped with other trees or a part of a tree stand) intended
to be retained and used to meet the tree canopy requirements herein shall be
measured to determine its caliper and the credit given for that tree shall be
in accordance with the first table in division (E) below.
   (B)   For any development site two acres or less in size, the area of tree
canopy coverage for any group of trees to be retained in order to meet the tree
canopy requirements of this section shall be determined by ground checking.
Credit for existing trees intended to be retained may be calculated in either
of two ways:
      (1)   Measurement of the trunk to determine its caliper and the credit
given for that tree shall be in accordance with the first table below; or
      (2)   The dripline may be plotted on the site plan and tree canopy credit
given for the percentage of the site within the dripline.
   (C)   New trees planted to meet the requirements of this subchapter shall be
given credit in accordance with the first table below. Such trees must meet the
standards of §§
155.165 through
155.179 at the time of planting.
   (D)   Street trees planted in accordance with §
155.147 shall qualify for a 25% bonus in the amount of credit listed in the
first table in division (E) below. This credit shall apply to street trees that
are mandated as well as those planted on a voluntary basis.
   (E)   In calculating the required number of trees, fractions less than one-
half shall be dropped and greater than or equal to one-half shall be rounded
up.

§ 155.125 TREE PRESERVATION PLAN REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   (1)   All applicants for development proposals which seek credit for
existing tree canopy to attain the minimum canopy coverage specified in this
section shall submit a tree canopy preservation plan. All tree preservation,
tree canopy protection, and woodland protection areas shall be in accordance
with the Tree Preservation Policies of Louisville Metro Planning and Design
Services.
      (2)   Note: Refer to §
155.172 for requirements relating to tree protection during construction.
   (B)   The content of such a plan is dependent upon the means by which the
existing tree canopy is to be calculated as follows.
      (1)   If no ground checking is used to determine the existing tree
canopy, then the plan shall depict the location of existing stands of trees on
the site and adjacent public rights-of-way that are proposed to be retained and
those that are proposed to be removed, if any.
      (2)   If ground checking is used to determine the existing tree canopy,
then the plan shall depict the location, species, and size (caliper) of any
individual existing tree that is proposed to be retained to meet the
requirements of this section. The location of existing stands of trees on the
site that are proposed to be retained and those that are proposed to be removed
shall also be provided.
      (3)   (a)   Tree canopy preservation areas (TCPA) are those areas where
tree preservation has been provided to meet the tree canopy requirements of
this section.
         (b)   The site shall be developed in accordance with the tree canopy
preservation plan. The location of the TCPA boundary delineates the limit of
disturbance associated with the TCPA. The limit of disturbance shall indicate
the location of the tree protection fencing.
         (c)   1.   No clearing, grading, construction, or other land
disturbing activity shall take place within the TCPA beyond pruning to improve
the general health of the tree or to remove dead or declining trees that may
pose a public health and safety threat. As trees are lost through natural
causes, new trees shall be planted in order to maintain minimum tree canopy as
specified in this subchapter.
            2.   Exception: Single-family residential development may remove
trees from the TCPA as long as they are replaced with trees of a similar type
(for example, A, B, or C).
         (d)   Location of structures and parking:
            1.   No structure shall be closer than 15 feet to the limit of
disturbance (tree protection fence); and
            2.   No vehicle use area (VUA) shall be closer than ten feet to the
limit of disturbance (tree protection fence).
         (e)   During all construction activity (includes clearing, grading,
building construction, and VUA construction), a copy of the approved tree
canopy preservation plan shall be on-site.
(LDC § 10.1.6) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.126 LANDSCAPE/BUFFER CREDIT.
   Any existing trees on a site or street trees planted on an adjacent right-
of-way that are used to meet the requirements of this section shall be credited
towards fulfillment of any landscaping, screening, or buffering provisions of
this subchapter.
(LDC § 10.1.7)
§ 155.127 WAIVERS.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall have the authority to grant waivers or
modifications of the tree canopy requirements contained in this subchapter in
accordance with Chapter 11, Part 8 of the Land Development Code.
   (B)   The Planning Commission’s designee may waive the requirement for a
public hearing and take action on requests for reduction of five or fewer trees
or a reduction constituting less than 10% of the total tree canopy requirement,
whichever is greater. Notice shall be sent in accordance with Chapter 11, Part
8 stating that a waiver request has been filed and that the Planning
Commission’s designee may waive the public hearing requirements and take action
on the request.
   (C)   In granting a waiver, the Planning Commission’s designee must find
that:
      (1)   The waiver is in compliance with the Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   The applicant made a good faith effort to provide as many trees as
possible on the site, on the adjacent right-of-way, or on an alternative site
as specified in the first table in §
155.124; and
      (3)   If there are other mitigating circumstances affecting this site
which do not generally apply to sites developed for the same use and in the
same form district.

§ 155.141 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   New development. No site development, building, or structure shall
hereafter be constructed nor vehicular use area (VUA) created unless
landscaping is provided as required by the provisions of this subchapter. Any
building, structure, or VUA that in its entirety is removed and reconstructed,
or relocated to a new on-site location, shall be considered new development for
purposes of this subchapter. Any VUA that in its entirety is changed from
gravel, stone, or similar material to asphalt or concrete pavement shall be
considered new development for purposes of this subchapter.
   (B)   Existing development. EXISTING DEVELOPMENT is subject to this
subchapter as defined below:
      (1)   Any increase/expansion of an existing building/structure’s square
footage by 20% or more;
      (2)   Any expansion of an existing VUA square footage by 20% or more or a
change of 20% or more of VUA surface from gravel, stone, or similar material to
asphalt or concrete pavement (semi-pervious pavers exempted); and
      (3)   Any increase in the combined square footage of building/structure
and VUA (as described in division (B)(2) above) of 20% or more of the combined
square footage.
   (C)   Improvements. When such improvements are made, the following landscape
provisions shall be required.
      (1)   Expansion by greater than 20% and less than 50%. Only the area of
new improvements shall be subject to the requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   Expansion by 50% or greater. The entire site shall be subject to
the requirements of this subchapter.
   (D)   Small sites (development which in its entirety occupies a site
measuring no more than 10,000 square feet).
      (1)   Expansion by greater than 20% and less than 50%. No landscaping
required.
      (2)   Expansion by greater than 50%. Only the area of new improvements
shall be subject to the requirements of this subchapter.
   (E)   Change of use. Change in the use of property, from a use not required
to provide landscaping and buffering to a use that is regulated by this part,
shall necessitate the provision of landscaping and buffering as required by
this subchapter.
   (F)   Non-conformance.
      (1)   No changes shall be made to sites that do not conform to this
section that would increase the non-conformance with this subchapter. Existing
landscape buffer areas, screening, and plant material on non-conforming sites
that partially meet the requirements of this subchapter shall be retained.
      (2)   Planting and buffering required in this subchapter can count
towards requirements in other sections of this regulation. However, compliance
with §§
155.140 through
155.154 does not substitute for compliance with other applicable sections of
this regulation.
(LDC § 10.2.2)
§ 155.142 LANDSCAPE BUFFER AREA REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Landscape buffer areas minimize the potential for nuisances created
when zoning districts or land uses of varying intensities abut, and shall be
required for all new construction subject to these regulations. Landscape
buffer area requirements shall be applied along property or right-of-way lines
and at the perimeter of vehicular use areas. Landscape buffer areas shall also
be applied adjacent to designated parkways and scenic corridors.
   (B)   Landscape buffer areas shall be provided on the site of the more
intense use or zoning district except when the more intense use was present
prior to the effective date of this regulation. When more than one landscape
buffer area requirement applies, the more restrictive standards shall be used.
(LDC § 10.2.3)
§ 155.143 PROPERTY PERIMETER LANDSCAPE BUFFER AREAS.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Property perimeter landscape buffer areas shall be applied along
all property boundaries of sites affected by this subchapter except for those
boundaries adjacent to streets.
      (2)   Zoning districts and their associated land uses have been grouped
into the following five intensity classes for the purpose of applying property
perimeter landscape buffer area requirements; refer to the table below.

      (3)   CUP sites located in a residential zoning district shall provide
buffering as per the requirements for uses permitted in the C-1 Zoning
District, or alternative buffering and landscaping as
approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
      (4)   Exceptions to the buffering requirements can be found in §
155.144.
      (5)   All development subject to this subchapter, as defined in §
155.141, shall provide landscape buffer areas and plantings as defined in the
tables below. Associated with each landscape buffer area requirement is a
planting density requirement. The planting density requirement indicates the
minimum amount of landscape material to be provided within each landscape
buffer area to ensure an appropriate screen.

D                2 The planting density multiplier allows for a reduction
                 in the size of landscape buffer areas with a provision of
                 an increased number of trees to offset the reduction in
                 buffer width. (A “2” multiplier requires twice the number
                 of trees to be planted as required in the Planting Density
                 and Screening table below.)

Example: In the neighborhood form district, construction of a C-1 retail
establishment (Intensity Class 4) is proposed adjacent to the R-4 district
(Intensity Class 1). A “C.4” buffer is required. A 35-foot buffer strip, 8-foot
screening fence, and 3 large trees per 100 feet of perimeter are required. The
developer has the option of decreasing the buffer to 25 feet, and increasing
the number of trees to 4.5 per 100 feet of common boundary with the R-
4 property. If the site were in the traditional neighborhood form, the
developer would have the option of a 15-foot buffer, with 4.5 trees per 100
feet.
 
   (B)   Explanatory text and exceptions.
      (1)   Property perimeter landscape buffer areas may contain walks,
trails, or other similar elements; provided that the required plant material
(as defined in § 155.144) is not eliminated and the landscape buffer area is at
least 25 feet wide. Property perimeter landscape buffer areas shall be free
from all other development including buildings, parking, driveways, or other
structures except those attendant to public utility service within a dedicated
easement. Outdoor storage or stockpiling of materials is not permitted within
property perimeter landscape buffer areas.
      (2)   Utility easements (for example, drainage, sewer, gas/electric) are
allowed to encroach into as much as 50% of the required width of property
perimeter landscape buffer areas; provided the required screening can still be
achieved and the design of such facilities is compatible with the purpose of
the landscape buffer area. If work is required within the easements causing
removal or damage of landscape materials (including any required fences, walls,
or berms), the property owner shall be responsible for replacement of materials
according to the approved landscape plan. Type C trees may be planted under
overhead utility lines at a minimum spacing of one tree per 30 feet of lineal
boundary with approval of utility company to meet perimeter tree planting
requirement.
      (3)   The landscape material and buffer area required generally shall be
provided by the property
owner of the higher intensity activity. If the higher intensity use is already
developed and the landscape material and buffer area, required in §§
155.120 through
155.127, 155.140 through 155.154, and 155.165 through 155.179 has not been
provided, the lower intensity use shall provide the required landscaping. If
the requirements of this subchapter have been fully complied with on an
adjoining property, the property owner is not required to duplicate them along
the common boundary.
      (4)   Property perimeter landscape buffer area requirements for schools,
fire stations, and other similar community facilities structures shall be
determined, as part of a community facility review, and will be based on the
form district, size (square feet), height, and location relative to adjacent
land uses.
      (5)   Private schools and churches are to be considered the same as
Intensity Class 3 for the purposes of screening in accordance with this
subchapter.
      (6)   Sites with a conditional use permit that are located in a
residential zoning district shall be considered the same as a C-1 commercial
use for the purposes of application of §§
155.120 through
155.127, 155.140 through 155.154, and 155.165 through 155.179. Sites located in
non-residential districts will follow the landscaping requirements for the
zoning district that they are in, unless the Board of Zoning Adjustment deems a
different classification is appropriate.
      (7)   Screens specified in the Planting Density and Screening table in
division (A)(5) above shall consist of shrubs, fences, berms, or walls,
individually or in combination, that meet the requirements outlined in §§
155.165 through

City of Jeffersontown): Unless a larger landscape buffer area is required, a
15-foot wide landscape buffer area shall be maintained at all side and rear
property lines. The landscape strip shall be planted with a number of large
(Type A) or medium (Type B) trees equal to one tree per 75 lineal feet of
boundary. Trees do not have to be evenly spaced; instead, tree placement should
be based on site characteristics and compatibility with other landscaping.
      (9)   Property perimeter landscape buffer areas, unless specifically
prohibited, may also count toward other yard, or setback requirements found
elsewhere in these regulations. Property perimeter landscape buffer areas may
count towards open space requirements in accordance with Chapter 10, Part 5.
      (10)   Cellular towers are considered the same as utility substations for
the purposes of screening in accordance with this subchapter.

the downtown form district.
         (b)   Property perimeter landscape buffer areas separating differing
land uses within a planned development zoning district shall not be required to
meet the standards set forth in this subchapter but shall adhere to the
approved master plan for each development.
         (c)   Landscape buffer area requirements are waived when a property
boundary separates shared parking (as defined in Chapter 9) and may be reduced
to Type A between parking when adjoining zoning districts are no more than one
intensity category apart.
         (d)   If property in Intensity Class 2 is developed as patio or town
homes with a maximum of six units per building and no more than two stories,
six foot high screening of adjacent single-family
property is not required. (Landscaping for attached housing using the ADI
regulations can be found in Chapter 4, Part 5.)
         (e)   When offsite buffering and plantings exist on adjoining
property, they may be applied toward the sites landscape buffer planting Type A
in division (B)(11)(c) above which refers to landscape buffer area in the
Property Perimeter Landscape Buffer Areas table in division (A)(5) above.
         (f)   Perimeter property landscape buffers are not required between a
multi-family residential zone and a single-family residential zone when the
multi-family residential property is developed as a single-family residential
use.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   Step 1. Determine intensity class for the proposed use and
adjacent sites.
         (b)   Step 2. Based on intensity class of proposed and adjacent uses,
determine applicable entries in the tables above.
         (c)   Step 3. Select buffer yard width option and associated planting
multiplier.
         (d)   Step 4. Identify required plantings and screening.
      (2)   Appendix 10A classifies tree species as type A, B, or C.
      (3)   Retaining walls are not permitted within a required landscape
buffer area.

§ 155.144 PROPERTY PERIMETER PLANTING.
   (A)   Planting within property perimeter landscape buffer areas will serve a
number of functions including screening, naturalizing, softening edges, and
unifying architectural elements. Planting density requirements, as outlined in
the Planting Density and Screening table in §
155.143(A)(5), have been established to allow for flexible design solutions
while reinforcing the site design standards of each form district.
   (B)   In situations where a property perimeter landscape buffer area slopes,
the required plantings shall be located where the staff of the Planning
Commission determines they will most effectively screen the more intensive
uses.
   (C)   Existing landscape material which is proposed to be used to fulfill
landscape requirements shall be shown on the required plan, and any plant
material in satisfactory condition may be used to satisfy these requirements in
whole or in part when, as determined by the staff of the Planning Commission or
the agency to whom it delegates authority, such materials meet the requirements
and achieves the objectives of this section. Existing healthy trees may be
substituted for trees required for property or vehicular use area perimeter
landscaping, or for interior landscaping by using the following criteria: a
six-inch to 12-inch caliper tree surrounded by a minimum of 150 square feet of
landscape area may be substituted for two new trees of the required minimum
size; a 12-inch to 24-inch caliper tree surrounded by a minimum of 250 square
feet of landscape area may be substituted for three new trees of the required
minimum size; a 24-inch or greater caliper tree surrounded by a minimum of 300
square feet of landscape area may be substituted for four new trees of the
required minimum size.

155.999
§ 155.172 PROTECTION DURING CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   All tree preservation, tree canopy protection, and woodland protection
areas shall be in accordance with Tree Preservation Policies of Louisville
Metro Planning and Design Services.
   (B)   A durable and visible barrier at least three feet in height and
approved by the Planning Director or designee shall be erected around all tree
canopy protection areas prior to any clearing or land disturbing activities
requiring a land disturbance permit. All barriers shall be located at the edge
of the area to be preserved, which is at least three feet beyond the drip line
of the protected tree, and shall remain in place until all construction is
completed.
   (C)   No clearing, grading, or other land disturbing activities shall be
allowed within the area enclosed by the tree protection barrier. No equipment,
materials, or vehicles shall be stored or placed within the area enclosed by
the tree protection fence.
   (D)   To prevent compaction of the soil or root system, no parking, material
storage, or construction
activities are permitted within the boundaries of the constructed barrier or
vegetative buffers, beyond that allowed for preliminary site investigation
work.
(LDC § 10.4.8) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.173 WALLS AND FENCES.
   (A)   Walls and fences built to satisfy the requirements of this subchapter
shall meet the following standards; walls shall be constructed of natural
stone, brick, or other weatherproof materials approved by the Commission
Director or designee; fences shall be constructed of wood or other
weatherproof, durable materials intended for exterior use and approved by the
Commission Director or designee; walls or fences used to satisfy screening
requirements shall be at least 80% opaque; fences shall provide a finished side
facing the lower intensity use.
   (B)   Chain link fencing may not, under any circumstances, be used to meet
any screening requirements of this regulation, nor shall slats installed as
part of a chain link fence be allowed to satisfy screening requirements.
However, chain link fencing may be installed for other purposes within the
required buffer area if it is used in addition to plants, berms, or other
allowable screening material and is not otherwise restricted by the form
district regulation or other applicable parts of this chapter.
   (C)   Walls and fences allowed to meet the requirements of this regulation
shall not be used to display or support any sign or other advertising device.

§ 155.175 LAND CLEARING.
   (A)   (1)   Selective clearing of trees, shrubs, and underbrush may be
necessary or desirable in certain instances. Trees along the edge of a
preservation area may be susceptible to off-site impact and non-construction
impacts (such as when a newly created woodland edge is formed increasing
exposure to higher winds and temperatures).
      (2)   Selective clearing may be an appropriate management technique
within woodland preservation areas after development to encourage new growth or
longevity. Selective clearing may also be necessary for individual trees that
may be in danger of falling on structures, roadways, or other vehicular use
areas, or into open sections of yard where outdoor activities are likely to
take place.
   (B)   Selective clearing will be limited to areas identified to allow such
clearing on an approved development plan, tree canopy plan, or landscape plan
and may only take place after the development is complete.
(LDC § 10.4.11) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.176 MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   For any tree located on public or private property as a requirement of
an approved landscape or tree preservation plan, the following activities are
prohibited:
      (1)   Attachment of rope, wire, nails, advertising posters, or other
contrivances; and
      (2)   Deposition, placement, or storage of stone, brick, sand, concrete,
or other materials which may impede the free passage of water, air, or
fertilizer to the root system.
   (B)   (1)   It will be the responsibility of the property owner to
perpetually maintain all landscape areas and associated plant material required
under these regulations.
      (2)   The property owner shall also be responsible for maintaining the
verge and associated trees within the verge unless the agency having
jurisdiction over that verge assumes that responsibility.
   (C)   All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one
year, or by the next planting period, whichever comes first, while other
defective plant material shall be replaced or repaired within three months.
   (D)   An authorized inspector shall have the right to enter onto any
property to inspect the health and general condition of plant material that is:
      (1)   Located within the ROW;
      (2)   Part of an approved development/landscape plan; or
      (3)   Reported as a public hazard.

§ 155.179 PDS TREE PRESERVATION POLICY.
   (A)   Language. The following language has been prepared by staff to clarify
both the intent and application of Planning and Design Services’ Tree
Preservation Policy.
   (B)   Intent.
      (1)   Tree preservation measures should address three objectives:
permanent protection for existing trees/tree masses that have been designated
to meet the tree canopy requirements of §§
155.120 through
155.127; permanent protection for existing trees/tree masses that are required
to be preserved by binding element; and temporary protection during development
of infrastructure to allow individual property owners the opportunity to
incorporate existing trees into their building sites. To differentiate between
these three intents, the following three designations are in effect and are
described in this policy:
         (a)   Tree canopy protection area (TCPA);
         (b)   Woodland protection area (WPA); and
         (c)   Tree preservation area (TPA).
      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, DEVELOPMENT PLANS refers to
preliminary subdivisions, general or detailed plans, conditional uses, and
rezonings.
   (C)   Tree canopy protection area (TCPA).
      (1)   Description.
         (a)   Tree canopy protection areas (TCPAs) are individual trees and/or
groupings of trees (trees may be existing or proposed) designated to meet the
tree canopy requirements of §§
155.120 through
155.127 and to be permanently protected. (Exception: Individual trees that are
designated as TCPAs on individually owned lots within single-family residential
subdivision developments may be removed as long as each removed tree is
replaced with another tree of a similar type (for example, A, B, or C)
elsewhere on that lot). TCPAs shall be clearly designated on approved
development plans by location.
         (b)   No structures shall be closer than 15 feet to the limit of
disturbance (tree protection fence) protecting a TCPA. No vehicle use area
(VUA) shall be closer than ten feet to the limit of disturbance (tree
protection fence) protecting a TCPA.
         (c)   As trees within TCPAs are lost through natural causes, new trees
shall be planted in order to maintain minimum tree canopy as specified on the
approved development plan.
      (2)   Requirements. All development plans showing TCPAs to seek credit
for preservation of existing trees to meet tree canopy requirements shall
submit and receive approval of a tree preservation plan in accordance with §
155.125 prior to issuance of any site disturbance permit, and shall contain the
following information and notes:
         (a)   Information.
            1.   Proposed site plan showing buildings, edges of pavement,
property/lot lines, easements, existing topography, and other significant site
features (LOJIC topographic information is
acceptable);
            2.   Preliminary drainage considerations (retention/detention,
ditches/large swales, and the like);
            3.   Location of all existing trees/tree masses existing on the
site (aerial photos or LOJIC maps are acceptable data sources), and delineation
of those to be preserved in TCPAs; and
            4.   Location of tree protection fencing for each tree/tree mass
designated to be protected. Dimension lines shall be provided to establish the
general location of tree protection fencing.
         (b)   Notes.
            1.   Tree canopy protection areas (TCPAs) identified on this plan
represent individual trees and/or portions of the site designated to meet the
tree canopy requirements of §§
155.120 through
155.127 and are to be permanently protected. All clearing, grading, and fill
activity in these areas must be in keeping with restrictions established at the
time of plan approval. As trees within TCPAs are lost through natural causes,
new trees shall be planted in order to maintain minimum tree canopy as
specified on the approved development or preliminary subdivision plan;
            2.   Dimension lines have been used on this plan to establish the
general location of TCPAs and represent minimum distances. The final boundary
for each TCPA shall be established in the field to include canopy area of all
trees at or within the dimension line;
            3.   Tree protection fencing shall be erected adjacent to all TCPAs
prior to site disturbance approval to protect the existing tree stands and
their root systems. The fencing shall be located at least three feet from the
outside edge of the tree canopy and shall remain in place until all
construction is completed;
            4.   No parking, material storage, or construction activities are
permitted within the TCPAs; and
            5.   During all construction activity (includes clearing, grading,
building construction, and VUA construction) a copy of the approved tree
preservation plan shall be on site.
   (D)   Tree preservation area (TPA).
      (1)   Description.
         (a)   Tree preservation areas (TPAs) represent those portions of the
site to be left undisturbed during development of roadways, utilities, and
similar infrastructure. TPAs are not permanent preservation areas; clearing,
grading, and/or removal of trees in TPAs is allowed at the time of individual
building or home construction.
         (b)   Any modification of the tree preservation plan requested by the
applicant may be approved by the designated DPDS staff if the changes are in
keeping with the intent of the approved tree preservation plan.
         (c)   Trees designated as TPAs only shall not be eligible to count
towards tree canopy requirements for a development site.
      (2)   Requirements. All development plans showing TPAs shall submit and
receive approval for a tree preservation plan in accordance with §§
155.165 through
155.179 prior to issuance of any site disturbance permit, and shall contain the
following information and notes:
         (a)   Information.
            1.   Proposed site plan showing buildings, edges of pavement,
property/lot lines, easements, existing and proposed contours, and other
significant site features (LOJIC topographic information is acceptable);
            2.   Preliminary drainage considerations (retention/detention,
ditches/large swales, and the like);
            3.   Location of all existing trees/tree masses existing on the
site (as shown by aerial photos or LOJIC maps are acceptable data sources); and
            4.   Location of tree protection fencing for each tree/tree mass
designated to be preserved. Dimension lines shall be provided to establish the
general location of tree protection fencing.
         (b)   Notes.
            1.   Tree preservation areas (TPAs) identified on this plan
represent portions of the site the developer has designated to be left
undisturbed during the development of roadways, utilities, and similar
infrastructure. These are not permanent preservation areas. Trees in these
areas may be removed during construction of homes or buildings on this site;
            2.   Dimension lines have been used on this plan to establish the
general location of TPAs and represent minimum distances. The final boundary
for each TPA shall be established in the field to include canopy area of all
trees at or within the dimension line;
            3.   Tree protection fencing shall be erected adjacent to all TPAs
prior to site disturbance approval (clearing and grading permit) to protect the
existing tree stands and their root systems. The fencing shall be located at
least three feet from the outside edge of the tree canopy and shall remain in
place until all construction is completed. When trees must be removed in a TPA,
the fence shall be relocated to protect all remaining trees within that TPA.
When a tree mass contains both TCPAs/WPAs and TPAs fencing shall only be
required at the outer most perimeter of that tree mass;
            4.   No parking, material, storage, or construction activities are
permitted within the TPAs beyond that allowed for preliminary site
investigation work;
            5.   a.   Clearing necessary to provide access for survey work,
rock soundings, or other usual and customary site investigations shall be
permitted prior to site disturbance approval. Preliminary site investigations
shall be carefully planned to minimize the amount of clearing required.
Clearing should follow proposed roadway centerlines and should not result in a
clear access way of more than 20 feet in width. Cleared access ways beyond
proposed roadways to assess individual lots shall not exceed 12 feet in width
or encroach into any proposed open space lots. No trees exceeding eight inches
in diameter measured at breast height (DBH) shall be removed without prior
approval by the DPDS.
               b.   If TPAs are not shown on the development plan, the
following condition of approval/binding element shall be attached to the plan.
         6.   The applicant shall identify, and submit for approval by
designated Division of Planning and Design Services (DPDS) staff, a plan
showing the location of tree preservation areas on site (exclusive of areas
dedicated as public right-of-way) prior to beginning any construction procedure
(i.e., clearing, grading, demolition). All construction shall be conducted in
accordance with the approved tree preservation plan. A partial plan may be
submitted to delineate clearing necessary for preliminary site investigations.
All tree preservation plans must be prepared in accordance with the standards
set forth by the DPDS.
   (E)   Woodland protection area (WPA).
      (1)   Description.
         (a)   Woodland protection areas (WPAs) are treed portions of the site
designated as part of the development approval process to be permanently
protected either in a natural state or following selective removal of
understory brush and/or trees as determined at the time of approval. WPAs shall
be designated on approved development plans by location and described in
associated notes, binding elements, or conditions of approval by general
character (left natural, only trees below two-inch caliper may be removed, and
the like).
         (b)   WPAs may also be used to count toward tree canopy requirements
for a development.
         (c)   No clearing, grading, or other land disturbing activity shall
take place in WPAs beyond pruning to improve the general health of the tree or
to remove dead or declining trees that may pose a public health and safety
threat. Additional activities within WPAs such as utility installation, fence
construction, walks, or supplemental planting shall be determined at time of
approval and/or described in notes, conditions, or approval and/or binding
elements on the plan.
         (d)   No structure may be closer than 15 feet to the limit of
disturbance (tree protection fence) protecting a WPA. No vehicle use area (VUA)
may be closer than ten feet to the limit of disturbance (tree protection fence)
protecting a WPA.
         (e)   WPAs will generally be protected by easement or other mechanism
shown on the approved development plan or described in binding elements/
conditions of approval for a development
plan. Subdivision deeds of restriction are used as one tool to inform future
property owners of clearing restrictions.
         (f)   Modification of woodland protection areas shown on approved
development plans may not be approved without notification of adjoining
property owners and the LD&T action.
      (2)   Requirements. All development plans showing WPAs shall submit and
receive approval for a tree preservation plan in accordance with §
155.125 prior to issuance of any site disturbance permit, and shall contain the
following information and notes:
         (a)   Information.
            1.   Proposed site plan showing buildings, edges of pavement,
property/lot lines, easements, existing topography, and other significant site
features (LOJIC topographic information is acceptable);
            2.   Preliminary drainage considerations (retention/detention,
ditches/large swales, and the like);
            3.   Location of all existing tree/tree masses existing on the site
(aerial photos or LOJIC maps are acceptable data sources), and delineation of
those to be preserved in WPAs. Location of tree protection fencing for each
tree/tree mass designated to be protected. Dimension lines shall be provided to
establish the general location of tree protection fencing; and
            4.   The applicant shall provide deeds of restriction ensuring that
WPAs will be permanently protected in a manner consistent with the binding
elements/conditions of approval and/or the approved development plan. The form
of such restrictions shall be approved by the Planning Commission counsel.
         (b)   Notes.
            1.   Woodland protection areas (WPAs) identified on this plan
represent portions of the site on which all existing vegetation shall be
permanently preserved. All clearing, grading, and fill activity in these areas
must be in keeping with restrictions established at the time of plan approval.
No further clearing, grading, construction, or other land disturbing activity
shall take place beyond pruning to improve the general health of the tree or to
remove dead or declining trees that may pose a public health and safety threat;
            2.   Dimension lines have been used on this plan to establish the
general location of WPAs and represent minimum distances. The final boundary
for each WPA shall be established in the field to include canopy area of all
trees at or within the dimension line;
            3.   Tree protection fencing shall be erected adjacent to all WPAs
prior to site disturbance approval (clearing and grading) to protect the
existing tree stands and their root systems. The fencing shall be located at
least three feet from the outside edge of the tree canopy and shall remain in
place until all construction is completed;
            4.   No parking, material storage, or construction activities are
permitted within the WPAs;
            5.   During all construction activity (includes clearing, grading,
building construction, and VUA construction) a copy of the approved tree
preservation plan shall be on site; and
            6.   The site shall be developed in accordance with the woodland
protection areas delineated on the site plan and related notes. Any
modification of the woodland protection areas requires notification of
adjoining property owners and the LD&T action.

then present its recommendations and the reports of the agencies and companies
to the subdivider and adjoining property owners at the TRC meeting.
   (D)   Administrative approval. Commission action may be taken by the
Director of the Division or any authorized staff member of the Division if the
plan or revision complies with Chapter 6, Part 2 of these regulations and
conforms to all zoning and form district regulations. Such action may not be
taken until the expiration of the seven-day petition period provided for in
divisions (D)(1) and (D)(2) below. No staff member shall be required to approve
any delegated item if they have reason to question its accuracy or its
compliance with any subdivision, zoning, form district, or other regulation.
Requested waivers and other items that are not appropriate for administrative
approval shall be submitted to the Planning Commission or Committee of the
Commission in accordance with division (D)(3) below.
      (1)   Applicants may request the LD&T review of the TRC recommendations
on forms supplied by the Division. Requests for review must be submitted within
seven calendar days following the Technical Review Committee meeting at which
the application is considered for approval. The request shall set out the item
(s) for which the applicant is seeking LD&T review. The request will be
considered for review at the first LD&T meeting following receipt of the
request, or at a subsequent meeting if so requested by the applicant. Final
action on the plan shall be taken in accordance with these regulations.
      (2)   Other persons may request the LD&T review of the TRC
recommendations. Petitions shall be filed on forms supplied by the Division and
must be submitted within seven calendar days following the Technical Review
Committee meeting at which the application is considered for approval. The
petition shall set out the item(s) for which the petitioner(s) is seeking the
LD&T review. Petitions will be considered for review at the first the LD&T
meeting following receipt of the petition, or at a later meeting if agreed to
by the applicant. The applicant and petitioner shall be notified of the review
date and item(s) to be considered during the review. Final action on the plan
shall be taken in accordance with these regulations.
      (3)   The LD&T review of the TRC recommendations shall address only
specific items of the development proposal that:
         (a)   Do not receive a consensus recommendation through the TRC
process;

(LDC § 7.2.40)
§ 155.222 SUBDIVIDER’S COMMITMENT AND BOND REQUIREMENT.
   Before Planning Commission approval may be shown on the record plat for
recording, the subdivider shall deliver to the Director of Works the following
items.
   (A)   Subdivided commitment.
      (1)   The subdivider shall be responsible for the installation, good
repair, and proper functioning of all improvements, including private roads,
required by the approved construction plan and the installation of all
reference monuments required by the record plat. Installation shall begin
within a year after approval of the record plat, or within any one-year
extension granted by the Director of Works, and shall proceed in a manner
which, in the judgment of the Director of Works, does not cause unreasonable
harm, inconvenience, or annoyance to any other property owner in or outside of
the subdivision. The judgment of the Director of Works with respect to the
manner of proceeding may not be questioned in any judicial proceeding by anyone
except the subdivider, but said judgment, when exercised in favor of the
subdivider, shall not constitute a defense to the subdivider in a judicial
action against the subdivider by a complaining property owner.
      (2)   This obligation of the subdivider shall continue until the Director
of Works, acting on behalf of the Planning Commission, has granted a release
pursuant to §
155.225. The required installations shall be completed and properly functioning
within five years from the date of which construction plans are approved,
unless an extension is requested by the subdivider and approved by the Director
of Works, in writing.
      (3)   If 80% of the lots do not have a completed structure on them, the
subdivider may request that the Director of Works, also acting on behalf of the
MSD, waive the 80% requirement and notify the Planning Commission of such
waiver. If the waiver is granted, the subdivider or design engineer, acting on
behalf of the subdivider, shall initiate the bond release process by sending a
written request for bond release inspection to the Public Works, the MSD, the
Health Department, and the local fire protection district. At any time after
the date of approval of the record plat, the subdivider shall abide by any time
limits which the Director of Works may specify in writing. This obligation
shall be evidenced, in writing, signed by the subdivider on forms provided by
the Director of Works.
   (B)   Security required. There shall be filed with the Director of Works a
bond instrument(s) approved by the Planning Commission and in the amounts
determined by the Director of Works and the MSD to ensure fulfillment of the
subdivider’s commitment as set out in division (A) above. Reduction of bond
requirements shall not alter the subdivider’s liability for fulfilling the
obligations set out in division (A) above.
(LDC § 7.2.45)
§ 155.223 REDUCTION OF BOND AMOUNT.
   The amount of bond may be reduced by the Director of Works, on the
recommendation of the MSD and acting on behalf of the Planning Commission, one
time only. No bond shall be reduced below an amount necessary to ensure the
installation of remaining improvements and the good repair and proper
functioning of all improvements at the time when 80% of the lots shown on the
record plat have primary structures built on them and appropriate measures
taken to prevent erosion and siltation. The reduced amount shall be determined
by Public Works and the MSD upon construction of the internal roadway
infrastructure. The design engineer shall submit a certificate as set forth in
§
155.368 to Public Works and the MSD.
(LDC § 7.2.50)
§ 155.224 BOND INSTRUMENTS.
   The subdivider shall post a bond instrument with Public Works to ensure
proper installation of the road and drainage improvements. In addition, the
subdivider shall post an encroachment and/or clearing and grading bond with
Public Works and/or the MSD. The bond instrument may be in the form of a letter
of credit or certificate of deposit with a properly executed assignment and
notice in the total bond amount. If the subdivider posts a surety bond, $3,000
of the total bond amount must be in the form of a letter of credit or a
certificate of deposit with a properly executed assignment and notice.
(LDC § 7.2.55)
§ 155.225 SUBDIVIDER’S RELEASE FROM GUARANTEEING PROPER FUNCTIONING.
   A subdivider may request a release from responsibility for the good repair
and proper functioning of required improvements by the Planning Commission in
accordance with the following procedures.
   (A)   A written request for release shall be submitted to the Director of
Works with copies sent to Metropolitan Sewer District, the Board of Health, the
agency or official having jurisdiction with respect to fire protection, and the
Mayor or designee if the subdivision is located within an incorporated city.
This release may be requested after primary buildings have been built on 80% of
all lots shown on the record plat and the street improvements (public and
private), drainage facilities, but not including sidewalks on unimproved lots,
have been installed in a good and workpersonlike manner and are functioning in
accordance with the approved construction plans.
   (B)   After 80% of the lots shown on the record plat have primary structures
built on them, the subdivider may request bond release. Upon receipt of a
written request from a subdivider, the appropriate agencies must inspect the
subdivision and inform the subdivider, in writing, of approval or deficiencies
within 30 days. If deficiencies are noted, the subdivider shall have 45 days to
complete the repairs and request re-inspection. The agency shall re-inspect and
advise the subdivider of approval or further deficiencies within two weeks.
Each agency shall provide original inspection reports and release approvals to
Public Works. If the subdivider disagrees with the written comments received,
an appeal may be filed with the Planning Commission. The Commission shall
review this request through the Land Development and Transportation Committee.
   (C)   Upon obtaining a written release from all appropriate agencies, the
Director of Works may release the subdivision bond completely or reduce the
bond to an amount necessary to ensure the installation of sidewalks, related
drainage, and any other right-of-way and easement improvements. This bond shall
be considered as if it were a separate bond designed solely for that purpose to
be released by the approval of the Director of Works with the approval of the
appropriate agencies. If a sidewalk only, pavement only, or drainage only bond
is required, it shall be of a limited time period to ensure that all such
improvements are constructed and fully functioning within two years of date of
said bond. The 80% figure referred to above may be increased or reduced by the
Director of Works, as specified in §
155.222(A).
(LDC § 7.2.60)
§ 155.226 BUILDER’S COMMITMENT.
   (A)   A builder on any lot in the subdivision shall be responsible for the
good repair and proper functioning of all installed improvements required by
the approved construction plan and installed reference monuments required by
the record plat and shall proceed with construction in a manner which is
satisfactory to the Director of Works and the subdivider, and which does not
cause unreasonable harm, inconvenience, or annoyance to any other property
owner in or outside of the subdivision. The judgment of the Director of Works
or that of the subdivider with respect to the manner of construction may not be
questioned in any judicial proceeding by any one except the builder, but said
judgment, when exercised in favor of the builder, shall not constitute a
defense to the builder in a judicial action against the builder by a
complaining property owner. An applicant for a building permit shall execute
and deliver written evidence of his or her awareness and commitment to fulfill
this obligation on forms approved by the Director of Works.
   (B)   The builder of each lot in a subdivision is required to grade the lot
so that cross-lot drainage is in conformance with the approved composite
drainage plan for the subdivision and all drainage from the lot is directed to
a public drainage facility in an easement or right-of-way.
(LDC § 7.2.65)
§ 155.227 BUILDER’S BONDS REQUIRED.
   At the time of the subdivided release from guaranteeing proper functioning
of required improvements pursuant to §
155.215, each builder is required to post with the Director of Works and/or the
MSD a builder’s bond prior to the issuance of the building permit to ensure the
fulfillment of the obligations set out in §
155.216 and to ensure compliance with the tree canopy requirements and sidewalk
requirements in accordance with §§
155.120 through
155.127. The bond shall be in the amount of $2,500 or an appropriate amount as
determined by the Director of Works, the Director of Planning, and/or the MSD.
In the event a building permit has been issued on unimproved lots that are
sensitive to generation of drainage related damages to existing development at
the time of release of the subdivided performance bond, a $2,500 bond or an
appropriate amount shall be posted on those lots by the builder. UNIMPROVED
LOTS refers to those on which no primary building has been constructed.
(LDC § 7.2.70)
§ 155.228 RELEASE OF BUILDER’S BOND.
   Application for release of a builder’s bond (§
155.227) may be made by filing a certificate with the Planning Commission and
the Director of Works or the MSD in conformance with §
155.371 bearing notice that false statements made therein are punishable.
Within 60 days of receipt of application for release of a builder’s bond, the
Director of Planning, Director of Works, or the MSD may make an inspection of
the subdivision and shall grant the release where it appears to his or her
reasonable satisfaction that the required improvements are installed and are in
good repair and functioning properly on and adjacent to the lot and that there
is no reason to believe that construction on the lot has or will cause
malfunctioning of installed improvements in other areas.
(LDC § 7.2.75)
§ 155.229 PROPERTY OWNER’S OBLIGATION.
   It is the obligation of a property owner in the subdivision not to damage,
alter, or destroy the required improvements or reference monuments and not to
allow any condition or activity on his or her property that will impair the
proper functioning of the required improvements. For violation of this
provision, the property shall be subject to the imposition of a lien for the
amount necessary to remedy the violations which may be enforced in the same
manner that mortgages are enforced, in addition to other remedies available.
(LDC § 7.2.80) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.230 ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDYING OF OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   If, at any time following the period allowed to the subdivider to
complete his or her obligations (§
155.222(A)), the Director of Works and/or the MSD finds that the required
improvements and reference monuments have not been installed or that they are
not in good repair or that they are not functioning properly and also finds
that it does not appear to his or her satisfaction that they will be completed
within a reasonable time, considering the potential for harm, inconvenience, or
annoyance to others, he or she shall recommend that the Planning Commission
declare the obligation of the subdivider, as well as the obligation of any
others who may appear to him or her to be responsible to be in default.
   (B)   Upon declaration of default, the Director of Works and/or the MSD
shall collect such amounts from bonds or otherwise as is required to remedy the
default. In the event that amounts available from bonds are sufficient to cover
the costs of remedying the default, such bonds shall be collected and used in
full or in such proportion as the Director of Works or the MSD determines to be
just and equitable based upon apparent responsibility therefor. Anyone claiming
to be aggrieved by such determination shall have, as his or her exclusive
remedy, a cause of action for contribution or indemnity against the parties
responsible for the default. The determination of the Director of Works or the
MSD shall not be used as evidence in support of or against responsibility in
such cause of action, and he or she shall not be made a party thereto.
   (C)   In the event that the Planning Commission has authorized bond
forfeiture for any section(s) of a subdivision for which the applicant is
responsible, no additional sections of the subdivision may be recorded until
such time as the Metro Public Works Department notifies the Planning Commission
that the roadway and drainage improvements for the previously recorded section
(s) in accordance with the approved construction plans have been completed.
(LDC § 7.2.85)
STANDARDS OF DESIGNS FOR MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS
§ 155.245 STREETS.
   (A)   In or adjoining any major subdivision of land hereafter proposed,
access from new lots or a new street connecting an existing street shall not be
approved unless the Planning Commission, with input from the Director of Works,
determines that the subdivision will be served by an adequate street network.
In order to be considered adequate, the street or combination of streets
providing most direct means of access to an arterial level street shall have a
minimum roadway width of 18 feet of pavement. The Commission may determine,
based on input from the Director of Works, that the traffic flow associated
with a proposed subdivision will utilize more than one route to one or more
arterial streets. As a result of such determination, the Planning Commission
may require that more than one route (street or combination of streets) must
have a minimum roadway width of 18 feet. In addition to the roadway width, the
Planning Commission may require other off-site improvements to correct
conditions that would impede the safe flow of traffic associated with the new
subdivision. Subdivisions that create no more than five lots of five acres or
more each are not subject to the requirements of this division (A). (Arterial
level streets are shown on Core Graphic 10: Roadway Classifications and
Projected Corridors). The provisions of this division (A) shall not apply to
roads that are designated roads under the System Development Charges for
Roadways Ordinance [insert LWICO citation].
   (B)   Subdivisions shall be designed to ensure that existing public and
private streets which stub into the subject property can be extended through
the subject property. For subdivisions creating any lot that abuts or has
access to any proposed stub street extension, right-of-way shall be dedicated
sufficient to accommodate the extension of the street, and the street shall be
constructed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter for
constructing public or private roads.

circulation by providing more convenient access to schools, parks, shopping,
and the like than is possible with sidewalks within the street right-of-way.
Such walkways shall have an easement width of at least ten feet.
   (B)   Mid-block walkways. When residential blocks are over 800 feet in
length, a walkway bisecting the block and dedicated to public use not less than
ten feet wide may be required to provide proper access to schools, playgrounds,
shopping centers, and other facilities.
(LDC § 7.3.20) Penalty, see §
155.999

   (E)   Drainage. No more than 15% of a required rear yard of a buildable lot
may be occupied by a detention basin or a retention basin or any other drainage
easement.
(LDC § 7.3.30) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.248 EASEMENTS.
   All easements shall conform to the following standards of design:
   (A)   Utility easements. An easement for utilities, at least ten feet wide,
may be required along any lot line or across lots whenever necessary to provide
for extension of utility lines. (See division (E) below for exception for
utilities serving urban infill.)
   (B)   Slope easements. Whenever a proposed subdivision affects an existing
or proposed road in such a way that will necessitate cuts and fills in
adjoining property, slope easements on such adjoining property shall be
required.
   (C)   Sewer and drainage easement. Whenever necessary, sewer and drainage
easements shall be provided in accordance with the MSD Design Criteria.
   (D)   Flood plain easement. Whenever necessary, floodplain easement shall be
provided in accordance with the MSD design criteria.
   (E)   Exception. Major residential subdivisions in the traditional

street or change in an existing public street;
      (5)   All resulting lots have frontage on an existing public or private
street with pavement at least 18 feet wide, except that roads serving no more
than five lots of five acres or more may be 12 feet wide with three foot
shoulders on each side; provided, however, that the provisions of this division
(E) shall not apply to roads that are designated road under the System
Development Charges for Roadways Ordinance [insert LMCO citation];
      (6)   The subdivision can satisfy these regulations and other applicable
ordinances and statutes without the construction of streets, water facilities,
storm drainage facilities, or other improvements, except as necessary to
directly serve the lots created and to provide a direct connection to an
existing and approved system;

street as listed in division (E) above. A plat creating such lots may be
approved in accordance with the provisions of §
155.353; and
      (19)   The plat would create new proposed private roadway(s) (for
example, access easement(s)). If the proposed roadways have received necessary
approvals, and related facilities meet the requirements of Chapter 6 Part 2 the
plat may be approved in accordance with §
155.354. The Division, based upon the recommendations of other governmental
agencies, may increase the requirements for private roadways beyond those

§ 155.348 MINIMUM PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR PRIVATE ROADWAYS.
   Minimum physical improvements for private roadways shall be as provided in
Chapter 6, Part 2.
(LDC § 7.8.50)
§ 155.349 MEASUREMENT OF SETBACK.
   All applicable form district regulations as pertaining to minimum setback
requirements shall be interpreted as being measured from the nearest boundary
of the private access easement.
(LDC § 7.8.55)
§ 155.350 LOTS.
   All new lots created by any subdivision of land hereafter proposed shall
conform to the minimum requirements of the applicable zoning and form district
regulations and shall also conform to the following standards of design:
   (A)   Lot constraints. Excessive depth in relation to width shall be
avoided, with a proportion of five to one normally being considered as a
desirable maximum for lot width of 60 feet or greater. Pointed or very
irregularly shaped lots and flag lots (except where required for utility
connection) shall be avoided where possible. Additional depth shall be required
on lots which abut to railroads, have frontage on major streets, or adjoin
other conflicting land uses, as specified in applicable form districts. In case
of unusual soil conditions or physical factors, including, but not limited to,
steep slopes, sinkholes, and/or the location of any portion of the property in
the floodplain, which may impair the health and safety of the persons in the
neighborhood in which a subdivision may be located, the Commission may prohibit
or limit disturbance of environmentally constrained sites as defined in §§
155.030 through
155.033. Division staff may approve lot shapes which vary from these general
guidelines.
   (B)   Access.
      (1)   All lots for any uses or structures shall have access to and abut a
public or private street for at least 25 feet. No private street shall be used
to provide access to more than 20 lots;
      (2)   All private streets, frontage roads, or ingress/egress easements
providing access to residential, commercial, industrial, or other properties or
buildings shall be named in accordance with Chapter 6, Part 3;
      (3)   Any minor plat submitted which creates, extends, widens, or
otherwise modifies a private street or submitted for creation or modification
of any lot(s) fronting on a private street shall be accompanied by a properly
prepared deed of restrictions for maintenance of the street which deed shall
have been reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission’s legal counsel (or
authorized designee) prior to recording; and
      (4)   Direct access to major arterial, minor arterials, and collector
level roadways from individual single-family lots is prohibited.
   (C)   Continuation of existing street. Subdivisions shall be designed to
ensure that existing public and
private streets which stub into the subject property can be extended through
the subject property. For subdivisions creating any lot that abuts or has
access to any proposed stub street extension, right-of-way shall be dedicated
sufficient to accommodate the extension of the street, and the street shall be
constructed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter for
constructing public or private roads.
(LDC § 7.8.60) Penalty, see §
155.999
§ 155.351 EASEMENTS.
   All easements shall be dedicated and shall conform to the following
standards of design.
   (A)   Utility easements. An easement for utilities, at least ten feet wide,
may be required along any lot line or across lots whenever necessary to provide
for extension of utility lines.
   (B)   Construction easements. Whenever a proposed subdivision affects an
existing or proposed road in such a way that will necessitate cuts and fills in
adjoining property, construction easements on such adjoining property shall be
required prior to recording of the plat.
   (C)   Sewer and drainage easement. Whenever necessary, sewer and drainage
easements shall be provided, having adequate width for workpeople with
necessary equipment to install, maintain, or repair sewer and drainage
facilities.
(LDC § 7.8.70)
§ 155.352 LARGE FORMAT MINOR SUBDIVISION PLATS.
   (A)   Minor subdivision plats exceeding 50 acres in area, consisting of more
than two pages, or that contain an irregular configuration which staff
determines cannot be adequately shown on legal-sized sheets must be submitted
as large format minor subdivision plats.
   (B)   The large format minor subdivision plat shall be drawn on Mylar at a
scale of not more than 100 feet to the inch. One copy, as required by the
Division’s application process, shall be submitted to the Planning and Design
Services. In case of an unusually large subdivision, Division staff may modify
this requirement and allow a scale of not more than 200 feet to the inch. All
distances and angles shall be drawn large enough to be legible after photo-
reduction of the plat by 50%.
   (C)   No sheet of the record plat may exceed 24 inches by 36 inches, unless
the Planning Commission and the County Clerk has agreed, in writing, to record
it. A two-inch by three inch space shall be reserved in the lower right hand
corner for the County Clerk’s stamp.
   (D)   All other sections of this subchapter shall apply to the large format
minor subdivision plats.
(LDC § 7.8.80)
§ 155.353 MINOR SUBDIVISION PLATS REQUIRING ROAD IMPROVEMENTS.
   Minor plats creating lots with frontage on existing public or private
streets that do not meet the pavement width standards specified in §
155.342(A)(9) and, therefore, require improvements to the existing street(s)
shall conform to the following standards.
   (A)   (1)   The minor subdivision plat shall be drawn on Mylar at a scale of
not more than 100 feet to the inch. One copy, as required by the application

A two-inch by three-inch space shall be reserved in the lower right hand corner
for the County Clerk’s stamp.
      (2)   All other sections of this subchapter shall apply.
   (B)   The plat shall show pavement depth; sidewalk details, if required;
roadway cross-section; and other items necessary for compliance with § 150.065
of the Louisville Metro Code of Ordinances and as required by Metro Public
Works.
   (C)   Before Planning Commission approval may be shown on the record plat
for recording, the subdivider shall deliver to the Director of Works the
following items.
      (1)   Subdivider’s commitment. The subdivider shall be responsible for
the installation, good repair, and proper functioning of all improvements,
including private roads, required by the approved minor plat and the
installation of all reference monuments required by the record plat.
Installation shall begin within a year after approval of the record plat, or
within any one-year extension granted by the Director of Works, and shall
proceed in a manner which, in the judgment of the Director of Works, does not
cause unreasonable harm, inconvenience, or annoyance to any other property
owner in or outside of the subdivision. The judgment of the Director of Works,
with respect to the manner of proceeding, may not be questioned in any judicial
proceeding by anyone except the subdivider, but said judgment when exercised in
favor of the subdivider shall not constitute a defense to the subdivider in a
judicial action against the subdivider by a complaining property owner. This
obligation of the subdivider shall continue until the Director of Works, acting
on behalf of the Planning Commission, has granted a release pursuant to §
155.225. The required installations shall be completed and properly functioning
within five years from the date of which construction plans are approved,
unless an extension is requested by the subdivider and approved by the Director
of Works in writing. If 80% of the lots do not have a completed structure on
them, the subdivider may request that the Director of Works, also acting on
behalf of the MSD, waive the 80% requirement and notify the Planning Commission
of such waiver. If the waiver is granted, the subdivider or design engineer,
acting on behalf of the subdivider, shall initiate the bond release process by
sending a written request for bond release inspection to the Public Works, the
MSD, the Health Department, and the local fire protection district. At any time
after the date of approval of the record plat, the subdivider shall abide by
any time limits which the Director of Works may specify in writing. This
obligation shall be evidenced in writing signed by the subdivider on forms
provided by the Director of Works.
      (2)   Security required. There shall be filed with the Director of Works
a bond instrument(s) approved by the Planning Commission and in the amounts
determined by the Director of Works and the MSD to ensure fulfillment of the
subdivided commitment as set out above. Reduction of bond requirements shall
not alter the subdivided liability for fulfilling the obligations set out in §
155.222(A).
   (D)   Note: § 150.065 - 150.073 of the Code of Ordinances required roads to
be 18 feet wide; roads serving no more than five lots five acres or greater may
be 12 feet wide with three-foot shoulders on each side.
(LDC § 7.8.85)
§ 155.354 MINOR SUBDIVISION PLATS CREATING PRIVATE STREETS.
   Minor plats creating new private streets serving single-family residential
uses may be approved only after review and approval of a construction plan for
the proposed private street. The construction plan shall conform to the
following standards.
   (A)   Construction plan requirement. No construction of improvements for a
subdivision shall begin until the subdivider has obtained a work order from the
Director of Works, and no work order shall be issued by the Director of Works
except in accordance with an approved construction plan, either for the
subdivision in its entirety or for sections thereof, in accordance with the
following procedure.
      (1)   Time limit. The construction plan shall be approved by Metro Public
Works prior to the
approval of the minor plat.
      (2)   Preparation. The subdivider shall have the construction plan
prepared by an engineer and
land surveyor in conformance with the requirements of §§
155.015,
155.016,
155.030 through
155.033,
155.045 through
155.051,
155.065 through
155.071, and
155.085 through
155.092 and any variances and waivers which have received prior Commission
approval in accordance with §§
155.194 and
155.200.
      (3)   Submission to other agencies. The subdivider shall submit that part
of the construction plan as required for approval or comment to interested
agencies which shall consist of the following:
         (a)   Director of Works;
         (b)   Metropolitan Sewer District;
         (c)   The Fire Chief of the district having jurisdiction over
property;
         (d)   Health Department;
         (e)   Utilities providing water, gas, electricity, and telephone
service; and
         (f)   If the proposed subdivision abuts on a street maintained by the
state, then to the district engineer for the state’s Department of
Transportation.
      (4)   Action taken on plan. Within 90 days of submittal of the
construction plan and following notification of approval of the plan by the
MSD, the Director of Works shall take action on behalf of the Commission and
shall notify the subdivider in writing of his or her action. The action of the
Director of Works shall take one of the following forms.
         (a)   Approval. The plan may be approved as submitted. A copy of the
approved construction plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission.
Approval of the plan shall be valid for one year and extensions of approval may
be granted by the Director of Works. Construction may not proceed without a
work order issued by the Director of Works in accordance with the approved
plan. The subdivider’s request for a work order shall be submitted to the Works
Department and the MSD no less than five working days prior to the day on which
construction is intended to begin.
         (b)   Disapproval. The plan may be disapproved and the Director of
Works shall state, in writing, if requested by the subdivider, his or her
reasons for disapproval. The subdivider must then submit a new construction
plan if he or she wishes to create the subdivision.

   (A)   Completion of land disturbing activity or development commenced or
approved prior to the effective date of this chapter.
      (1)   Buildings or developments with previously issued building permits
or approved construction plans. Any building, structure, development, or land
disturbing activity for which a valid building permit was granted or for which
construction plans were approved prior to the effective date of this chapter
shall be permitted to proceed to construction even if such activity or
construction does not conform to the technical provisions of this chapter. If
construction is not completed within the time allowed under the original
building permit, construction plan approval or any extension granted, then the
building or development shall be constructed or completed only in compliance
with all requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Buildings or developments with complete applications for
construction plan approval. Any building, structure, development, or land
disturbing activity for which a complete application for construction plan
approval has been submitted to the MSD, prior to the effective date of this
chapter, shall be permitted to finish the approval process and, if approved,
proceed according to the approved plans even if such construction or activity
does not conform to the technical provisions of this chapter. If construction
is not completed within the time allowed under the original construction plan
approval or any extension granted, then the building or development shall be
constructed or completed only in compliance with all requirements of this
chapter.
      (3)   Developments or other activities with applications for approval
pending. Any development or land disturbing activity that has submitted an
application for preliminary subdivision, development plan, conditional use, or
any other type of land use or grading/clearing approval other than for
construction plan approval, but for which no final action has been taken by the
appropriate reviewing body on such application prior to the effective date of
this chapter, shall be approved only if the development or land disturbing
activity complies with all provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Grandfathered development/activities still subject to enforcement and
penalties provisions. Developments or land disturbing activities for which
complete applications for construction plan approval have been submitted or
approvals/permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this chapter
may proceed as provided in division (A)(2) above; provided that all such
development and land disturbing activities undertaken after the effective date
of this chapter, and not otherwise exempt from this chapter, shall be in
accordance with the previously approved plans. Failure to develop in accordance
with such previously approved plans or failure of the previously approved plans
to prevent offsite sedimentation shall subject the development to all
provisions of this chapter, including those provisions dealing with inspection,
enforcement, and penalties.

(Ord. 26, passed 9-25-2001)
§ 156.027 REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   Applicability. No land disturbing activity subject to the provisions
of this chapter shall take place except in accordance with either:
      (1)   An approved EPSC plan and a duly-issued site disturbance permit; or
      (2)   An authorized general permit.
   (B)   Types of EPSC plan approval procedures. For purposes of this chapter,
there are three types of plan approval procedures keyed to the proposed land
disturbing activity at issue: Type I review, Type II review, and review
pursuant to a general permit. These review procedures are described in §§
156.030 through
156.032, and summarized in 156.028.
   (C)   Types of permits. There are two types of permits granted by the MSD to
allow land disturbing activities subject to the provisions of this chapter:
site disturbance permits (Type I and Type II approvals) and general permits.
These permit requirements are keyed to the proposed land disturbing activity at
issue and are described in §§
156.030 through
156.032, and summarized in
156.028.
   (D)   Types of EPSC plans required. There are two types of EPSC plans that
may be required as part of an application for approval of land disturbing
activities subject to this chapter: concept EPSC plans and detailed EPSC plans.
Plan preparation requirements are described in 156.029.
      (1)   Concept EPSC plans are required only for those land disturbing
activities subject to a Type I review and not otherwise exempt or subject to a
general permit under the terms of this chapter. When no concept EPSC plan is
required, documentation will be so noted on the land-use plan receiving
preliminary plan approval from the MSD.
      (2)   Detailed EPSC plans are required for all land disturbing activities
subject to this chapter, except those authorized by a general permit.
   (E)   Applications. Applications for review and approval of EPSC plans shall
be submitted by the permittee on forms provided by the MSD in such numbers as
required by the MSD. Applications shall be accompanied by a non-refundable fee
established by the MSD to defray the costs of program administration and
operation.
   (F)   Permitted scope of action.
      (1)   All EPSC plans shall be approved according to the procedures set
forth in §§
156.030 through
156.032. In addition, all plans shall evidence compliance with the standards
set forth in §§
156.045 and
156.046 and applicable standards and specifications set forth in the MSD’s
Design Manual, Standard Specifications, and Standard Drawings.
      (2)   The MSD may impose conditions on the application or allow

to ensure compliance with this chapter and/or reduce the erosion or
sedimentation adverse impacts or off-site degradation of the development or
land disturbing activity.
   (G)   Submittal requirements. A schedule of submittal requirements for each
type of application and plan required under this chapter is set forth in the
MSD Design Manual. The schedule of submittal requirements shall be reviewed
periodically and may be adjusted, if necessary, by the MSD.
   (H)   Revocation authority. The MSD shall have the authority to revoke any
final approval or permit granted pursuant to this chapter, after notice to the
permittee, upon a finding of any of the following:
      (1)   The land disturbing activity is being undertaken in violation of
this chapter;
      (2)   The land disturbing activity is being undertaken in violation of
any approved plans, specifications, or conditions of approval;
      (3)   The land disturbing activity is being undertaken in such a way as
to constitute a public nuisance; or
      (4)   (a)   The approval or permit was procured by false representation
or was issued by mistake.
         (b)   Upon revocation of any final approval or permit, all land
disturbing activities authorized by that approval or permit shall cease until
and unless a permit or approval is reissued; provided that all remedial or
reclamation work shall proceed as directed by the MSD.

§ 156.029 PLAN PREPARATION AND CONTENT.
   (A)   Concept EPSC plans.
      (1)   Applicability. A concept EPSC plan, submitted by a qualified plan
preparer, shall be required for all land use applications subject to a Type I
review procedure.
      (2)   Contents. The concept EPSC plan shall contain the information and
data as set forth in the MSD Design Manual, Standard Specifications, and
Standard Drawings, including a narrative.
      (3)   Plan preparers.
         (a)   Detailed EPSC plans for land disturbing activities subject to
Type I review. A detailed EPSC plan subject to Type I review shall be prepared
and certified by a qualified plan preparer. In addition, the MSD may require
consultation with geologists, hydrologists, soil scientists, and other
professionals, as the MSD deems appropriate.
         (b)   Detailed EPSC plans for land disturbing activities subject to
Type II review. Unless determined otherwise by the MSD, a detailed EPSC plan
subject to Type II review shall be prepared and certified by a qualified plan
preparer. Such determination will be based upon the amount of site disturbed,
the type of disturbance and the proximity to drainageways.
(Ord. 26, passed 9-25-2001)
§ 156.030 TYPE I REVIEW PROCEDURE; ISSUANCE OF SITE DISTURBANCE PERMIT.
   (A)   Applicability. Type I review shall be required if a land disturbing
activity under this chapter is proposed as part of an activity or development
subject to land use approval by the Louisville and the county’s Planning
Commission, the TRC, the LD&T, Board of Zoning Adjustment, or legislative body.
Such activities include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Standard and innovative subdivisions, excluding minor plats and
record plats;
         (b)   Developments requiring a general or detailed development plan
under the Development Code;
         (c)   Conditional uses under the zoning provisions of the Development
Code; and
         (d)   Developments requiring a rezoning.
   (B)   Concept EPSC plan submittal and approval.
      (1)   Concept EPSC plan submittal. The permittee shall submit a concept
EPSC plan, when required, to the DPDS as part of the application for the land
use or development approval.
      (2)   Preliminary review and approval. The concept EPSC plan shall be
forwarded to the MSD and also distributed to interested agencies for their
review and comment as part of the development application approval process.
Taking into consideration interested agency and public comments, the MSD shall
review and take final action on the concept EPSC plan, either approving,
approving with conditions, or denying the concept EPSC plan.
      (3)   Pre-construction site meetings-determination. As part of the
concept EPSC plan approval, MSD may require that a pre-construction site
meeting occur for purposes of enforcing and administering the provisions of
this chapter in accordance with division (D) below.
   (C)   Detailed EPSC plan submittal.
      (1)   Detailed EPSC plan submittal. Prior to the commencement of any land
disturbing activity in anticipation of development or construction, a detailed
EPSC plan shall be submitted to the MSD concurrent with any required
construction plans or building permit applications.
      (2)   Referral to the DPDS and the Department of Public Works. The
detailed EPSC plan, as part of the submitted construction plans, may be
referred to the DPDS and the appropriate Department of Public Works for review
and comment. Such review shall be primarily in regard to the detailed EPSC
plan’s potential conflicts with other land development and land use standards
and policies and conformance with applicable performance standards.
   (D)   Pre-construction site visits and meetings.
      (1)   Purposes. The purposes of a pre-construction site meeting are to:
         (a)   Correct any inadequacies in the EPSC plan that are identified
during the visit and meeting;
         (b)   Ensure that the permittee, particularly the on-site contractor
representative, understands the EPSC plan, inspection, maintenance, and record-
keeping requirements; and
         (c)   In addition, the MSD inspectors and other involved personnel
should inspect and note existing natural conditions adjacent to and downstream
of the controls prior to construction, so that any changes or degradation due
to inadequate control measures can be more easily identified during future
inspections.
      (2)   Applicability/timing.
         (a)   If required as a condition of concept EPSC plan approval, a pre-
construction site meeting shall be conducted prior to the MSD final action on
the detailed EPSC plan.
         (b)   In all other cases, the MSD, in consultation with the other
reviewing agencies, may require a pre-construction site meeting prior to the
MSD final action on the detailed EPSC plan, or may require a pre-construction
site meeting as a condition of detailed EPSC plan approval and postpone such
visit until the notice of construction is received.
      (3)   Participants in the pre-construction site meeting. The following
persons may participate in a pre-construction site meeting:
         (a)   Appropriate MSD personnel and, if warranted, representatives
from the DPDS, the Department of Public Works, or any other relevant review
agencies; and
         (b)   The permittee; the project designer or engineer; the CCR, if
applicable; and, if available, the contractor (foreperson or similar person).
   (E)   MSD final action on the detailed EPSC plan and issuance of site
disturbance permit.
      (1)   MSP final action; general provisions. The MSD shall consider any
comments and shall then take final action on the detailed EPSC plan, either
approving, approving with conditions, or denying the detailed EPSC plan.
      (2)   Minor/no revisions to the detailed EPSC plan-site disturbance
permit issuance. After review of the detailed EPSC plan and the pre-
construction site meeting (if applicable), if no revisions to the plan or only
minor revisions or field adjustments to the plan are necessary for approval,
the MSD shall take the following actions:
         (a)   The MSD shall approve or conditionally approve the detailed EPSC
plan; and
         (b)   If all other site disturbance related approvals required under
federal, state, or local law or regulation have been received, the MSD shall
grant a site disturbance permit to the permittee. At the MSD’s discretion, the
site disturbance permit may be issued prior to final approval of the remainder
of any submitted construction plans considering such factors as weather and
optimum construction scheduling.
      (3)   Significant revisions to the detailed EPSC plan. If the MSD and
interested agency review of the detailed EPSC plan, other construction plans
for development, and/or the pre-construction site meeting reveals the need for
significant revisions to the detailed EPSC plan, the MSD approval shall not be
granted. Instead, the MSD shall allow the permittee a reasonable opportunity to
revise the plan and re-submit the plan for re-review and final action by the
MSD. If the MSD thereafter approves or conditionally approves the revised plan,
the MSD shall grant a site disturbance permit to the permittee. At the MSD’s
discretion, the site disturbance permit may be issued prior to final approval
of the remainder of any submitted construction plans, considering such factors
as weather and optimum construction scheduling.
   (F)   Effect of detailed EPSC plan approval/site disturbance permit
issuance.
      (1)   Permitted activities. Upon issuance of the site disturbance permit,
site clearing and grading activities in anticipation of construction may
commence on the site only after required EPSC measures are installed and
appropriate notice is given pursuant to division (G) below. No work/building
permit shall be issued or requested until a site disturbance permit is granted.
      (2)   Automatic lapse for inactivity. If the permittee does not commence
land disturbing construction or development activity according to the
provisions and time frame established or approved in the underlying land use
approval, then the approval of the detailed EPSC plan and the site disturbance
permit shall automatically lapse and become null and void.
   (G)   Notification of construction. Upon receiving detailed plan approval
and a site disturbance permit, the permittees for land disturbing activities
subject to these Type I review and site disturbance permit requirements shall
file a notice of construction with the MSD no later than three working days
prior to construction activity initiation or related (non-exempt) land
disturbing activity on a site, whichever occurs first. Prior notice of
construction allows the MSD to conduct, in a timely manner, any required pre-
construction site meetings and to schedule inspections during construction, as
necessary. Violation of this provision may result in immediate issuance of a
notice of violation or a stop work order under §§
156.075 through
156.080.
   (H)   Completion of construction and final inspection request.
      (1)   Certification of completion. Upon completion of site construction
and final stabilization, the permittee shall submit a letter of completion to
the MSD certifying that construction, including final stabilization, is
complete and in accordance with all approved EPSC plans. Temporary EPSC
measures may still be in place at the time of certification of completion,
depending on the season; provided that adequate surety is given pursuant to §
156.061 for the maintenance and ultimate removal of such temporary controls at
a later date.
      (2)   Permit termination.
         (a)   If at final inspection the site is in compliance with the
approved EPSC plan, including final stabilization or adequate surety pursuant
to §
156.061, the site disturbance permit shall be terminated.
         (b)   If at final inspection the site is not in compliance with the
approved EPSC plans or this chapter, the site disturbance permit shall not be
terminated, related performance assurances shall not be released, and the
permittee shall not be permitted to request a certificate of occupancy for the
development.
(Ord. 26, passed 9-25-2001)
§ 156.031 TYPE II REVIEW PROCEDURE; ISSUANCE OF SITE DISTURBANCE PERMIT.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   Requires building permit only (no land use approval). Type II
review shall be applicable to all land disturbing activities subject to this
chapter that are associated with the construction of a specific development
proposal that does not require land use approval under the Development Code.
Type II review shall also be applicable to earth excavation, structure
demolition, site clearing, or filling of land (including excavations and earth
filling which may be performed without a conditional use permit pursuant to §
9.6 of the Development Code). For example, a development proposal that is
consistent with applicable zoning and that only needs a building permit to
proceed to construction shall be subject to a Type II review for purposes of
this chapter.
   (B)   Detailed EPSC plan submittal and approval.
      (1)   Detailed EPSC plan submittal. Prior to the commencement of any land
disturbing activity in anticipation of development or construction, a detailed
EPSC plan shall be submitted to the MSD concurrent with required construction
plans or building permit application.
      (2)   Pre-construction site meeting. Following detailed EPSC plan
submittal, the MSD, in consultation with the reviewing agencies, may require a
pre-construction site meeting prior to taking final action on the detailed EPSC
plan. Alternately, the MSD may require a pre-construction site meeting as a
condition of detailed EPSC plan approval and postpone such meeting until the
notice of construction is received pursuant to division (D) below. Participants
in the pre-construction site meeting shall be as set forth in §
156.030(D)(3).
      (3)   MSD final action; general provisions. The MSD shall consider any
comments from the public and interested review agencies and shall then take
final action on the detailed EPSC plan, either approving, approving with
conditions, or denying the detailed EPSC plan.
      (4)   Minor/no revisions to the detailed EPSC plan-site disturbance
permit issuance. After review of the detailed EPSC plan and the pre-
construction site meeting (if applicable), if no revisions to the plan or only
minor revisions or field adjustments to the plan are necessary for approval,
the MSD shall take the following actions:
         (a)   The MSD shall approve or conditionally approve the detailed EPSC
plan; and
         (b)   If all other site disturbance related approvals required under
federal, state, or local law or regulation have been received, the MSD shall
grant a site disturbance permit to the permittee. At the MSD’s discretion, the
site disturbance permit may be issued prior to final approval of the remainder
of any submitted construction plans considering such factors as weather and
optimum construction scheduling.
   (C)   Significant revisions to the detailed EPSC plan. If the MSD and
interested agency review of the detailed EPSC plan, other construction plans
for development, and/or the pre-construction site meeting reveal the need for
significant revisions to the detailed EPSC plan, the MSD approval shall not be
granted. Instead, the MSD shall allow the permittee a reasonable opportunity to
revise the plan and re-submit the plan for re-review and final action by the
MSD. If the MSD approves or conditionally approves the revised plan according
to provisions of this section, the MSD shall grant a site disturbance permit to
the permittee. At the MSD’s discretion, the site disturbance permit may be
issued prior to final approval of the remainder of any submitted construction
plans considering such factors as weather and optimum construction scheduling.
   (D)   Effect of detailed EPSC plan approval/site disturbance permit
issuance.
      (1)   Permitted activities. Upon issuance of the site disturbance permit,
site clearing and grading activities in anticipation of construction may
commence on the site only after all required EPSCs are installed and
appropriate notice is given pursuant to this division (D). No work/building
permit shall be issued or requested until site disturbance permit approval is
granted.
      (2)   Automatic lapse for inactivity. If the permittee does not commence
land disturbing activity or construction within one year of the MSD’s approval
of the detailed EPSC plan or within the approved time frame for any related
building permit, whichever occurs first, then the approval of the detailed EPSC
plan and the site disturbance permit shall automatically lapse and become null
and void.
   (E)   Notification of construction. Upon receiving detailed plan approval
and a site disturbance permit, the permittees for land disturbing activities
subject to these Type II review and site disturbance permit requirements shall
file a notice of construction with the MSD no later than three working days
prior to construction activity initiation or related (non-exempt) land
disturbing activity on a site, whichever occurs first. Prior notice of
construction allows the MSD to conduct in a timely manner any required pre-
construction site meetings pursuant to division (B) above, and to schedule
inspections during construction, as necessary. Violation of this provision may
result in immediate issuance of a notice of violation or a stop work order
under §§
156.075 through
156.080.
   (F)   Completion of construction and final inspection request. The
provisions regarding notification of completion of construction, final
inspection, and permit termination set forth in §
156.030(H) shall apply.
(Ord. 26, passed 9-25-2001)

   The MSD shall review all EPSC plans for compliance with the following
general standards and review criteria.
   (A)   Overall design goal.
      (1)   A design removal efficiency goal of 80% for total suspended solids
from land disturbing activities shall be applied to the design, review, and
approval of EPSC plans. The following structural and non-structural standards
are to be utilized to achieve this goal.
         (a)   Compliance with the MSD design manual, standard specifications,
and standard drawings. Except where innovative or alternative management
practices are approved pursuant to division (B) below, all EPSC measures shall
be designed and installed in accordance with the specifications contained in
the MSD Design Manual, Standard Specifications, and Standard Drawings, as it
may be revised from time to time, which is hereby incorporated by reference
into this chapter.
         (b)   Non-structural site management practices. Non-structural site
management practices to prevent erosion and minimize sediment discharge shall
be considered in the MSD’s evaluation of this division (A). Such practices may
include the following standards:
            1.   Minimize site disturbance to preserve and maintain existing
vegetative cover;
            2.   Limit the number of temporary access points to the site for
land disturbing activities;
            3.   Phase and sequence construction activities; and/or
            4.   Locate temporary and permanent soil disposal areas, haul
roads, and construction staging areas to minimize erosion, sediment transport,
and disturbance to existing vegetation.
      (2)   Where attainment of this design removal efficiency goal through the
use of structural and non-structural measures is not practicable, the permittee
shall submit written justification to the MSD for review and approval.
   (B)   Alternative management practices. To encourage the development and
testing of alternative EPSC measures, alternative management practices that are
not included in the MSD Design Manual, Standard Specifications, and Standard
Drawings may be allowed upon review and approval of the MSD.
      (1)   A permittee seeking to use an alternative management practice shall
concurrently submit substantial evidence that the proposed measure will perform
at least equivalent to a currently approved control contained in the MSD Design
Manual, Standard Specifications, and Standard Drawings. Evidence may include,
but is not limited to, peer-review by a panel of registered professional
engineers and research results as reported in professional journals or other
literature.
      (2)   If the MSD finds the control or practice has failed or is
inadequate to contain sediment on- site, the permittee shall remove and replace
it with a control approved by the MSD and found in the MSD Design Manual,
Standard Specifications, and Standard Drawings.
(Ord. 26, passed 9-25-2001)
§ 156.046 EPSC STANDARDS; SPECIFIC.
   The MSD shall review all EPSC plans for compliance with the following
specific standards and review criteria.
   (A)   Sediment tracking control. Stabilized construction entrances shall be
located and utilized at all points of ingress/egress on a construction site.
The transfer of soil, mud, and dust onto public rights-of-way shall be
minimized.
   (B)   Construction dewatering operations. Whenever construction dewatering
operations are required on a site, they shall be conducted according to the
specifications set forth in the MSD Design Manual, Standard Specifications, and
Standard Drawings.
   (C)   Crossings of waterways. Crossing of waterways during construction
shall be minimized and approved by the MSD. Encroachment into stream buffers,
riparian areas, and wetlands shall be avoided.
   (D)   Topsoil. Topsoil shall be stockpiled and preserved from erosion or
dispersal both during and after site grading operations.
   (E)   Temporary stabilization measures.
      (1)   Where construction or land disturbance activity will or has
temporarily ceased on any portion of a site, temporary site stabilization
measures shall be required as soon as practicable, but no later than 14
calendar days after the activity has ceased. Permanent or temporary
stabilization shall be completed within:
         (a)   Fourteen calendar days for the surface of all perimeter dikes,
ditches, swales, perimeter slopes, and all slopes greater than three horizontal
to one vertical; or
         (b)   Fourteen calendar days as to all other disturbed or graded areas
on the project site.
      (2)   The requirements of divisions (E)(1)(a) and (E)(1)(b) above do not
apply to those areas which are shown on the plan and currently being used for
material storage or for those areas on which construction activities are
currently being performed or to prepared structural subgrades; provided, that
structural EPSC measures remain in place.
   (F)   Final stabilization. Final stabilization of the site shall be required
within 14 calendar days of construction completion,
   (G)   Temporary structural controls. Temporary structural controls installed
during construction shall be designed to accomplish maximum stabilization and
control of erosion and sedimentation, and shall be installed, maintained, and
removed according to the specifications set forth in the MSD Design Manual,

controls shall function as designed when controlling the peak runoff resulting
from the storm event identified in the MSD Design Manual, Standard
Specifications, and Standard Drawings.
   (H)   Permanent structural controls. All permanent structural controls,
including drainage facilities such as channels, storm sewer inlets, and
detention basins, shall be designed according to the standards set forth in the
MSD Design Manual, Standard Specifications, and Standard Drawings.
(Ord. 26, passed 9-25-2001)
MAINTENANCE AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
§ 156.060 MAINTENANCE AND DAMAGE REMEDIATION.
   (A)   Maintenance during construction.
      (1)   The permittee, or his or her designee, shall be required to conduct
continuing inspections of all EPSC measures, and direct the appropriate persons
to make any repairs or modifications necessary, within 48 hours of the initial
discovery of a control failure or violation, unless extenuating circumstances
such as weather or complexity of repairs or modifications justify a longer time
frame. At a minimum, such inspections shall occur every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after each storm event that produces one-half inch or more of
precipitation.
      (2)   In addition, silt accumulation upstream of temporary controls shall
be removed when the control reaches the percentage of storage capacity
established for the maintenance of that particular type of control in the MSD
Design Manual, Standard Specifications, and Standard Drawings.
      (3)   A copy of the EPSC plan and records of all inspections, repairs,
and modifications shall be available on-site throughout the duration of the
construction or land-disturbing activity. All records of inspection shall be in
a form specified by the MSD and shall include the date and time of inspection,
and the name and signature of the inspector as defined in division (A)(1)
above. These records shall be made available to agency inspectors upon request.
      (4)   If the permittee chooses to use a CCR for site inspections and
monitoring of all land disturbing activities, the permittee shall sign a
statement giving the CCR full authority to inspect the site and to require
necessary measures to maintain compliance. The name, address, and phone number
of the CCR shall be noted on the cover sheet of the submitted detailed EPSC
plan, but in no instance later than the time notice of construction is filed
with the MSD. If requested, the CCR shall submit signed and dated weekly
inspection logs to the appropriate inspection agency. Copies of such logs shall
be maintained on site and shall be signed and dated by the CCR.
   (B)   Post-construction maintenance. Following release or acceptance of a
project (and termination of the site disturbance permit), the property owner
shall be responsible for maintaining the project site in a manner to prevent
soil erosion and sedimentation in violation of this chapter.
   (C)   Damage remediation.
      (1)   In the event of adverse impacts or off-site degradation resulting
from improper controls or practice in violation of this chapter, the MSD shall
have the authority to take the following action:
         (a)   Determine the extent of damage resulting from noncompliance with
the plan or failure to maintain the practices required by the plan;
         (b)   Determine the impact and severity of the resulting adverse
impacts or off-site degradation;
         (c)   Require and approve an agreement with the permittee for
correction and clean-up of the existing damage and an agreement for prevention
of future damage; and
         (d)   Cost incurred by the MSD and other agencies, as a result of
having to hire outside expertise, to determine the extent, impact, and severity
of damage and in remediating any such damage shall be collected from the
permittee.
      (2)   Failure of the permittee to implement the agreement according to
its terms shall constitute a violation of this chapter, and subject the
permittee to all applicable enforcement actions and penalties.
(Ord. 26, passed 9-25-2001)
§ 156.061 PERFORMANCE ASSURANCES.
   (A)   Permittee responsibility. The permittee shall be responsible for the
installation, good repair, maintenance, proper functioning, and ultimate
removal of all temporary and permanent EPSC measures.
   (B)   Fiscal surety required. For all land disturbing activities subject to
a Type I or Type II review under this chapter, the permittee may be required to
post a fiscal surety, consisting of a performance bond or other instrument,
acceptable to, and approved by, the MSD. When a fiscal surety is required, the
following conditions will apply.
      (1)   Timing of surety. The surety shall be posted no later than the
issuance of a site disturbance permit or, with the MSD approval, prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, as applicable.
      (2)   Combination with other appropriate bonds. Whenever feasible, the
fiscal surety for EPSC required by this section may be combined with and posted
as part of the sanitary sewer lateral extension bond or subdivision performance
bond required for all subdivisions approved pursuant to the Development Code.
      (3)   Amount of surely. For activities subject to Type I review, the
amount of the surety for EPSC shall be the cost of the approved EPSC measures
to be installed on the site and any prescribed site revegetation or restoration
measures, including labor costs. The MSD shall have the discretion to set
alternate amounts for or to waive a surety for activities subject to Type II
review that are commensurate with the complexity or size of the project. The
final amount of the surely shall be determined by the MSD and shall be in
addition to any other surety required as part of subdivision or development
approval.
      (4)   Use of surety. If at any time following the period allowed to the
permittee to complete his or her obligations under this chapter, the MSD finds
that:
         (a)   The required temporary or permanent improvements or control
measures have not been installed or maintained properly;
         (b)   The required temporary or permanent improvements are not in good
repair or functioning properly; and
         (c)   1.   Required revegetation and restoration of a site have not
been completed as required;
            2.   In addition to other enforcement remedies, the MSD may declare
the permittee to be in default if it does not appear that the improvements or
controls will be completed or repaired within a reasonable time considering the
potential for harm, inconvenience, nuisance, or annoyance to others including
nearby property owners; and
            3.   Upon declaration of default, the MSD shall demand such amounts
from the surety as required to remedy the default. In the event that amounts
available from the surety are sufficient to cover the costs of remedying the
default, such surety shall be collected and used in full in such proportion as
the MSD determines to be just and equitable based upon apparent responsibility
for the default. Anyone claiming to be aggrieved by such determination shall
have, as his or her exclusive remedy, a cause of action for contribution or
indemnify against the parties responsible for the default. The determination of
the MSD shall not be used as evidence in support of or against responsibility
in such cause of action and the MSD shall not be made a party to such action.
      (5)   Release of surety. Application for release of a fiscal surety
required by this chapter may be made by filing a certificate with the MSD
bearing a notice that false statements made therein are punishable. The MSD may
make an inspection of the property and shall grant a release of the surety upon
determining that:
         (a)   Site construction is finished;
         (b)   Final stabilization has been completed;
         (c)   The site disturbance permit has been terminated;
         (d)   The required improvements and controls are properly installed,
are in good repair, and are functioning properly;
         (e)   Temporary controls have been removed; and
         (f)   There is no reason to believe that construction on the lot has
or will cause the malfunctioning of installed improvements on other property.
      (6)   Imposition of lien. In addition to or as an alternative to use of
any fiscal surety, the MSD shall have the option of placing a lien on any
property on which the permittee has failed to properly install, keep in good
repair, or maintain the proper functioning of all required temporary and
permanent EPSC measures or has failed to complete required revegetation or
restoration measures. The amount of the lien may cover necessary costs of
ensuring compliance with applicable provisions of this chapter, including, but
not limited to, any necessary remedial and restoration measures to alleviate
the adverse impacts or off-site degradation, and all associated administrative
costs.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 156.075 MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Modifications to review standards and criteria. The MSD Chief
Engineer, in consultation with other applicable reviewing agencies, shall have
the authority to make modifications to applicable EPSC standards/design
requirements and exemptions set forth in this chapter or the MSD Design Manual,
Standard Specifications, and Standard Drawings to provide flexibility to deal
with the unique characteristics of a site. Such modifications may be granted
only upon a finding by the MSD Chief Engineer that the standards set forth in
this section have been met.
   (B)   Modifications to controls. Changes to the location and placement of
temporary non-structural or structural controls may be approved by the MSD
Chief Engineer during construction plan review or, once construction has
commenced, may be approved in the field by an inspector without the need for
additional, formal review if the change is in accord with the MSD Design
Manual, Standard Specifications, and Standard Drawings. However, changes to the
location or placement of permanent structural controls shall necessitate formal
review and approval by the MSD.
   (C)   Review standards for modifications. No modification shall be approved
by the MSD unless all of the following standards have been met:
      (1)   The requested modification is consistent with the purposes of this
chapter and will not have adverse effects on the effectiveness to the plan to
adequately control erosion and sedimentation as required by this chapter;
      (2)   The requested modification eliminates an unnecessary burden on the
permittee and is required to address some unusual aspect of the site or
proposed development that is not shared by landowners in general; and
      (3)   Any potential adverse impacts resulting from the modification will
be mitigated.

   (C)   Negotiated compliance.
      (1)   Applicability. It is the intent of this chapter that negotiated
compliance be pursued and secured whenever practicable and effective prior to
alternative enforcement measures being invoked. However, where clearing or
other land disturbing activity has proceeded without an approved plan, issuance
of a site disturbance permit, and proper notice of construction under this
chapter, or where a violation is causing or has the imminent ability to cause
adverse impacts or off-site degradation, the inspector shall immediately issue
a notice of violation and stop work order. When clearing or other land
disturbing activity has proceeded without proper notice of construction only,
the inspector shall be authorized to immediately issue a notice of violation
and, as necessary, a stop work order. Failure of a properly approved,
installed, and maintained plan to contain sediment on-site shall not alone
constitute off-site degradation or a violation of this chapter; provided,
remedy of such is performed by the contractor during the course of same day
activities.
      (2)   Process. When the inspector, based on personal observation or
investigations, has reasonable cause to believe that a person has committed a
violation of this chapter or any plan approved or permit granted hereunder, the
inspector shall undertake a negotiated compliance process as set forth below
unless circumstances dictate alternative compliance measures. This negotiated
compliance process shall consist of:
         (a)   A warning to the on-site permittee of any deficiencies;
         (b)   An explanation of necessary corrective action; and
         (c)   Specification of a reasonable time frame within which such
corrective action shall occur (no more than 48 hours, unless extenuating
circumstances such as weather or complexity of repairs or modifications justify
a longer time frame).
      (3)   Documentation. The inspector shall document the negotiated
compliance process with a written notice to the permittee setting forth the
identified deficiency, the request for corrective action, and the time frame
for compliance. The documentation process shall include:
         (a)   A copy of the written notice shall be placed in the appropriate
agency file;
         (b)   A copy shall be given to the owner, contractor’s representative,
or responsible person on site; and
         (c)   In the event that no authorized person is on-site and that the
inspector is not successful in contacting the permittee(s), a copy of the
notice to comply shall be sent certified mail to the permittee(s).
      (4)   Compliance review. At the end of the time period specified above,
an inspector shall perform a follow-up site inspection to determine whether
compliance has been achieved. Depending on that determination, the following
actions may occur.
         (a)   Corrective action performed. If the identified deficiencies have
been corrected, the inspector shall issue an inspection report stating that
fact and the site shall be returned to a normal construction review status.
         (b)   Corrective action not performed. If the identified deficiencies
have not been corrected, further actions may be initiated as outlined in
division (B) below.
   (D)   Notice of violation/stop work order. If the negotiated compliance
process fails to produce necessary corrective action, the inspector shall be
authorized to issue a notice of violation (NOV). A stop work order shall be
issued in conjunction with the NOV when the violation is causing, or has the
imminent ability to cause, adverse impacts or off-site degradation, or in other
circumstances as deemed necessary by the inspector.
      (1)   Form of NOV and issuance.
         (a)   Issuance of a NOV initiates enforcement proceedings for
violations of this chapter. Where the inspector, based upon personal
observation or investigation, has reasonable cause to believe that a person has
committed a violation of the chapter, and the inspector has complied with
division (A) above, the inspector is authorized to issue a NOV to the permittee
and co-permittees.
         (b)   The NOV shall be in a form prescribed by the MSD and shall
contain:
            1.   The date and time of issuance;
            2.   The name and address of the permittee to whom the NOV is
issued;
            3.   The date and time the violation was committed;
            4.   The facts constituting the violation;
            5.   The section of the chapter violated;
            6.   The name of the inspector;
            7.   The civil fine that will be imposed for the violation; and
            8.   A statement informing the permittee to whom the NOV is issued
of the right to appeal the NOV or to contest the proposed civil penalty.
      (2)   Stop work order. Issuance of a stop work order shall result in a
suspension of the project development or site plan approval, and except for
work related to remediation of the violation, no additional land disturbing
activity shall occur and no additional grading or building permits shall be
issued until the violation is resolved to the enforcement agency’s
satisfaction. Stop work orders shall specifically state the provisions of this
chapter being violated.
      (3)   Service of NOV and stop work order. Service of a NOV or stop work
order shall be by personal service to the on-site supervisory personnel at the
site, by posting a copy of the NOV and any stop work order at the site, and by
certified mail to the permittee.
      (4)   Compliance notice. When compliance measures specified in the NOV
are satisfactorily completed, the permittee shall notify the MSD. The MSD shall
re-inspect the site no later than the following work day after notification by
the permittee. Upon acceptance, the inspector shall provide a written notice of
compliance to the permittee and place such letter in the appropriate agency
file.
      (5)   Appeal. When an NOV is issued, the person to whom the NOV is issued
shall respond to the NOV within seven days of the date the NOV is issued by
either remedying the violation and paying the civil fine set forth in the NOV
or requesting, in writing, a hearing before the EPSC Board to contest the NOV.
If the person fails to respond to the NOV within seven days, the person shall
be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing to contest the NOV and the
determination that a violation was commuted shall be considered final. In this
event, the EPSC Board shall enter a final order determining that the violation
was committed and imposing the civil fine set forth in the NOV. Filing of an
appeal does not stay the effect or the obligations of a stop work order or a
NOV unless otherwise ordered by the designated official hearing such appeal,
based on a demonstration by the permittee issued the NOV of a substantial
likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the appeal, and the absence of
adverse impact if the order or the NOV is stayed pending review.
      (6)   Immediate action. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit
the MSD from taking immediate action in the court of appropriate jurisdiction
to remedy a violation of this chapter when there is reason to believe that the
existence of the violation presents a serious threat to the public health,
safety, and welfare or, if in the absence of immediate action, the effects of
the violation will be irreparable or irreversible.
   (E)   The EPSC Board shall hear all contested NOVs.
      (1)   If a person to whom the NOV is issued requests a hearing before the
EPSC Board, the EPSC Board shall schedule the hearing within 14 days unless all
parties mutually agree to a continuance.
      (2)   Evidence against the person charged with the violation shall be
presented; the person cited may be represented by counsel. The EPSC Board shall
take all testimony under oath and may subpoena alleged violators, witnesses,
and evidence to its hearing.
      (3)   Any person not appearing at a duly scheduled hearing shall be
deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the EPSC Board may enter its
final decision.
      (4)   The EPSC Board shall hear the evidence presented and based thereon
shall render its decision and final order, which may uphold the NOV; dismiss
it; order remedies and corrective action or a penalty; or some combination
thereof.

§ 156.079 REPEATED VIOLATIONS; APPEALS.
   (A)   Repeated violations. In cases in which the permittee has a record of
repeated notices of violations causing adverse impact or off-site degradation
within a two-year period, the MSD shall be authorized to undertake any or all
of the following actions:
      (1)   To refuse to accept applications for any development or land
disturbing activity or to process any such application of the permittee;
      (2)   To revoke a general permit as it applies to any development or land
disturbing activity carried out by the permittee; and/or
      (3)   To revoke the certification of any CCR who has been associated with
serious or repeated violations of the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Appeals from the EPSC Board. Appeals shall be taken to a state court
of competent jurisdiction pursuant to applicable state statutes.
(Ord. 26, passed 9-25-2001)
§ 156.080 EDUCATION AND TRAINING.
   (A)   On-site responsible personnel training.
      (1)   Within six months of the effective date of this chapter, all on-
site responsible personnel shall be required to hold a certificate of
attendance from a MSD-sponsored or approved training course. This requirement
applies to persons employed by homebuilders, contractors, utilities, or any
other person in a position of operational control over the land disturbing
activity. This training shall be valid for a period of three years or until the
course content is significantly modified due to ordinance modification or
additional state or federal requirements, whichever occurs first.
      (2)   Further, the permittee shall certify to the MSD at the time of plan
submittal that a person holding an attendance certificate shall be on the site
during construction or development activity to such degree as to be in
operational control over the land disturbing activity and provide continuing
inspections in accordance with §
156.060. This person may include, but is not limited to, a foreperson,
developer, construction manager, or property owner.
      (3)   The name of this person shall be provided to the MSD as soon as it
is available, but no later than the time that notification of construction or
disturbance is filed with the MSD. The MSD shall maintain a list of attendees
to all training programs and provide confirmation of attendance.
   (B)   Training and certification.
      (1)   Agency inspector training and certification. Within six months of
the effective date of this chapter, all agency inspectors shall be required to
attend a MSD-sponsored or approved training course. Each inspector shall be
required to achieve certification through this course to conduct site
inspections, issue violations, negotiate on-site compliance, and refer
violations for formal enforcement actions. This certification shall be valid
for a period of three years, upon which the inspector must be re-certified.
      (2)   Agency plan reviewer training and certification. Within six months
of the effective date of this chapter, all agency plan reviewers are required
to attend a MSD-sponsored or approved training course. Each plan reviewer shall
be required to achieve certification through this course to conduct plan
reviews, pre-construction site meetings, and permit negotiations. This
certification shall be valid for a period of three years upon which the plan
reviewer must be recertified.
      (3)   Qualified plan preparer training. Qualified plan preparers,
including, but not limited to, professional engineers and landscape architects,
shall be strongly encouraged to attend training sessions for plan reviewers and
inspectors, as space is available. The MSD may also, at its discretion, develop
a separate course for qualified plan preparers. A fee may be established for
this training based on the actual cost to develop and administer this course.
         (a)   The option of a CCR is offered to allow for self-monitoring of
the EPSC plan implementation. Based on demand, the MSD may sponsor or approve a
training course to certify private individuals as CCRs. These certifications
shall be valid for a period of not more than three years. The MSD may extend
this period; however, continuing education shall be required for maintenance of
the CCR. At the MSD’s sole discretion, a fee may be established for this
training based on the actual cost to develop and administer this course.
         (b)   The MSD, in its discretion, may provide incentives for the use
of a CCR.
   (C)   Revocation of certifications.
      (1)   Certifications may be revoked by the MSD for repeated violations of
the provisions of this chapter, activities that result in significant adverse
impact or off-site degradation, or for willful disregard in implementing the
intent of the certification programs. The MSD shall appoint a hearing officer
to hear appeals of revocation actions. Any third party may bring action for
revocation of a certification. These actions shall be presented to the MSD
hearing officers for decisions.
      (2)   Any revocation action shall be supported by documentation as deemed
appropriate by the hearing officer. The hearing officer may establish penalty
amounts up to $500 per occurrence depending on the nature of the offense.
Revocation of certifications shall be for at least one year. Re-certification
shall be based on attending the training courses and paying all appropriate
fees. Re-certification will only be allowed one time in a three-year period
from the date of revocation.

§ 156.999 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates this chapter, or any plan approved or permit granted
hereunder, shall be subject to a fine of no more than $4,000 per violation and
shall comply with such remedial orders as may be issued by the EPSC Board. Each
act of violation and each day during which the violation exists after the
period granted by §
156.078(C) and (D) to remedy the violation shall be deemed a separate offense.
