subsequent meeting of the Board of Commissioners as long as it takes effect
prior to the effective date of the original repealer.

unchanged with respect to an amendment which is repealed at the same meeting of
the Board of Commissioners which enacted the amendment.
   (D)   An amended ordinance with a delayed effective date remains unchanged
with respect to that amendment if the ordinance making the amendment is
repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of the Board of Commissioners
as long as the repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of
the original amendment.
   (E)   No other action of the Board of Commissioners repealing a repealer or
an amendment shall have the effect of reviving the original language of the
repealer or amendment as the case may be. (KRS 446.100)
§ 10.09 RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES ACCRUING BEFORE REPEAL OF ORDINANCE.
   No new ordinance shall be construed to repeal a former ordinance as to any
offense committed against a former ordinance, nor as to any act done, or

arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment

§ 35.53 PROCEDURES FOR APPLYING FOR REFUND OF OVERPAYMENT.
   (A)   Any taxpayer (pursuant to this subchapter) who truly believes that he
has made or permitted an overpayment of his or her liability for any restaurant
tax required by this subchapter may apply for refund of said overpayment
provided that he or she files an amended return, verified under oath and
setting forth in detail the full explanation of the reason of the said claimed

overpayment is made or the date he or she said restaurant tax payment was due,
whichever occurs first.

division (A) above, then the City Director of Finance, with the Tax
Administrator’s written approval shall have the authority to honor and refund
any such overpayment actually made above actual liability upon the restaurant

sole discretion was made through honest mistake or inadvertence.
   (C)   In no event shall any refund be made for any payment upon any
restaurant tax unless the refund claim is submitted and filed in strict
compliance with the foregoing provisions of this section upon such refund claim
forms or amended return forms as hereafter shall be promulgated by the City Tax

§ 35.54 FAILURE TO FILE RETURN, FAILURE TO PAY THE RESTAURANT TAX WITHHELD,
UNDERPAYMENT OF AMOUNT DUE.
   (A)   If the taxpayer liable for collecting the restaurant tax and filing a
return fails to make a return, the City Tax Administrator shall prepare an
estimate of the amount of restaurant taxes due based on the best information
available to them. The City Tax Administrator may make investigations to assist
in making the estimate. He or she may consider the volume of business done in
the same type of business, and any other relevant maters. When the City Tax
Administrator estimates the restaurant taxes, the amount of interest and late
charges provided by this subchapter shall be added to the taxes due. He or she
shall notify the taxpayer of the amount due. Such notification shall be in
writing and shall contain a brief description of the method and estimated
figures used in arriving at the estimated tax. Any taxpayer may dispute the
amount of the estimated tax by filing within thirty (30) days of notification
of the estimated taxes a return accompanied by payment of the entire balance
due together with the interest and late charges due. Such return shall be
processed like any late return, and shall establish the restaurant tax
liability of the taxpayer in place of the estimated amount prepared by the City
Tax Administrator. However, the City Tax Administrator may later determine that
the amount shown in the return is insufficient so there is a deficiency, in the
same manner as in the case of other returns.
   (B)   If the City Tax Administrator determines, by examining available
evidence, that the amount of restaurant taxes paid over by the taxpayer is less
than the amount required by this subchapter, he or she shall notify the
taxpayer of the deficiency. The City Tax Administrator may use any of the
methods authorized in division (A) of the section to determine whether a
deficiency exists and to determine the amount of such deficiency. He or she
shall thereupon notify the taxpayer of the deficiency. Such notice shall be in
writing and shall state not only the amount of the deficiency but also the
methods and estimates used in arriving at the amount of the deficiency. If the
taxpayer does not object in writing within thirty (30) days of the date of
receiving such notice, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have accepted the
revised figures for the restaurant tax liability. If the taxpayer does file
written objection within the time specified, the taxpayer shall pay the fees,
together with penalties and interest, under protest and may thereupon pursue
administrative and judicial remedies as provided by this chapter and by state
law to seek a refund.
   (C)   If the City Tax Administrator finds that any taxpayer has overpaid, he
or she shall notify them of overpayment and shall refund the amount of the
overpayment to them.
   (D)   When the City Tax Administrator notifies any taxpayer of any estimated
amount due, alleged overpayment, or refund, he or she shall include in the
notice clear instructions on how, when, and where the taxpayer may protect or

assessment. If the action contests the undertaking of the improvement by the

owner, no further action on the improvement insofar as it relates to any
property owner who is a plaintiff shall be taken until the final judgment has
been entered.
   (B)   The city may proceed with the improvement with respect to any
properties whose owners have not filed or joined in an action as provided in
this section or who have contested only the amounts of their assessments, and
the provisions of the resolution are final and binding with respect to such
property owners except as to contested amounts of assessments. After the lapse
of time as herein provided, all actions by owners of properties are forever
barred. (KRS 91A.270)
§ 36.57 WHEN CITY MAY PROCEED; ASSESSMENT CONSTITUTES LIEN.
   (A)   After the passage of time for the action provided for in §

later, the city may proceed with the improvement or part thereof stayed by the
action, including notice requiring payment of special assessment or installment
thereon and bonds or other method proposed to finance the improvement. The
first installment may be apportioned so that other payments will coincide with
payment of ad valorem taxes.
   (B)   The amount of any outstanding assessment or installments thereof on
any property, and accrued interest and other charges, constitutes a lien on the
property to secure payment to the bondholders or any other source of financing
of the improvement. The lien takes precedence over all other liens, whether
created prior to or subsequent to the publication of the ordinance, except a
lien for state and county taxes, general municipal taxes, and prior improvement
taxes, and is not defeated or postponed by any private or judicial sale, by any
mortgage, or by any error or mistake in the description of the property or in
the names of the owners. No error in the proceedings of the Board of
Commissioners shall exempt any benefited property from the lien for the
improvement assessment, or from payment thereof, or from the penalties or
interest thereon, as herein provided. (KRS 91A.280)
§ 36.58 EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL PROPERTY OR CHANGE IN FINANCING.
   The city may undertake any further proceedings to carry out the improvement
or any extension or refinancing thereof, except that §§
36.53 through
36.57 applies if additional property is included in the improvement or if
change is made in the method or period of financing; but additional property
may be included in the improvement with the consent of the owner thereof
without compliance with other sections if it does not increase the cost
apportioned to any other property, or any other change may be made without such
compliance if all property owners of the improvement consent. (KRS 91A.290)
PROCUREMENT
§ 36.70 MODEL PROCUREMENT CODE ADOPTED.
   The city adopts the State of Kentucky's Model Procurement Code. All
purchases and contracts, with exceptions where bidding would be inappropriate,
must be awarded by competitive sealed bidding to the responsible bidder whose
bid is either the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated bid price.
§ 36.71 USE OF ALTERNATIVE METHODS.
   Competitive sealed bidding is not always feasible, and the Model Procurement
Code permits the use of alternative methods in the following situations:
   (A)   Competitive negotiation may be used where (a) specifications are too
vague; (b) sources of supply are limited, time and place of performance cannot
be determined, price is regulated by law or a fixed price contract is not
applicable, or (c) bids received are unreasonable or identical.
   (B)   Negotiations may be conducted if all the bids received through
competitive sealed bidding exceed available funds;
   (C)   Non-competitive negotiations may be used where (a) an emergency
exists, (b) there is only one supplier, (c) the contract is for the services of
a licensed professional, (d) the contract is for the purchase of perishable
items brought at frequent intervals, (e) the contract is for replacement parts
where the need cannot be anticipated, (f) the contract is for proprietary items
for resale, (g) the contract is for purchases on trips, (h) the contract is for
purchase of supplies sold at auction, (I) the contract is for insurance, or (j)
the contract is for supplies at reduced prices; or
   (D)   Small purchase procedures may be used where the aggregate amount of
the contract is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00)
(Am. Ord. O-2020-09, passed 8-24-20)
§ 36.72 FORMAL BIDS - PURCHASES OVER $40,000 AND LOCAL PREFERENCE.
   (A)    Formal bid procedures: Formal bids are published by the City Clerk
with direct assistance from the using departments, as approved by the City
Manager, in the preparation of technical specifications, plans, bid documents
and drawings where required. The following steps are to be followed:
      (1)   The using department forwards appropriate memorandum and supporting
documentation, including technical specifications, to the City Clerk. General
terms and conditions, special instructions, and other bid package inserts are
to be compiled by the using department with oversight by the City Manager.
      (2)   The final bid invitation is disbursed by the City Clerk. The City
Clerk shall also advertise for bids and oversee the distribution of the bid
package provided by the requisitioning department.
      (3)   Formal bids will be received and opened publicly at the specified
date, time, and place set forth in the bid documents by the City Clerk and then
tabulated on forms and submitted to the City Manager.
      (4)   All bids received and tabulated will be forwarded to the using
department for review. The using department then prepares a written memorandum
to the City Clerk containing their recommendations for award to the lowest and
best responsible bidder meeting the city's specifications.
      (5)   Kentucky preference laws. KRS 45A.494 states that "prior to a
contract being awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder on a
contract by a public agency, a resident bidder of the Commonwealth shall be
given a preference against a nonresident bidder registered in any state that
gives or requires a preference to bidders from that state. The preference shall
be equal to the preference given or required by the state of the nonresident
bidders."
      (6)   Local preference. The Model Procurement Code is supplemented to
authorize a local preference in bidding as set out below when approved, listed
on the bid document as authorized by a city commission. In an event the Board
of Commissioners wishes to apply the local preference the bid document shall
state "Local Preference shall apply" in the bid document and advertised as
such.
         (a)   Definitions.
            LOCAL BUSINESS ENTITY. Any person, corporation, limited liability
company, partnership or other business entity complying with the following:
               1.   The business entity must be registered to do business in
the city and have an established physical place of business within the city
limits of the city; and
               2.   The location of the business must be properly zoned and
shall not be a post office address; and
               3.   The business entity must not have any delinquent property
taxes, net profit fees or occupational withholdings owed to the city or have
any outstanding liens or fines due to the city; and
               4.   The business entity must have paid property taxes, net
profit fees or employee withholdings to the city during the previous fiscal
year in a total amount not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00).
         (b)   Certification of local business entity status. It shall be the
responsibility of the local business entity to claim that status in writing at
the time any bid is submitted. No preference shall be granted if city staff is
unable to confirm the local business entity status.
         (c)   Applicability of the local preference. The local preference
shall only be applicable to bids solicited and accepted by the city where the
bid award amount is forty thousand dollars ($40,000) or greater.
         (d)   The local preference shall not be applicable to bids accepted by
the city that:
            1.   Involve federal funds or other funds that prohibit the use of
local preferences; or
            2.   Emergency purchases; or
            3.   Bids in which a preference has already been applied pursuant
to any Commonwealth of Kentucky bidding regulations.
         (e)   Local preference.  
            1.   The city may grant to a local business entities, who are a
responsive and responsible bidder for applicable bids, a local bidding
preference of up to ten percent (10%) of the local business entity’s bid, not
to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per item, over the amount of the
lowest responsible bidder. In situations in which the bid is an evaluated bid,
any local business entity qualifying for the local bidding preference shall be
granted three (3) points to its total evaluation score due to a shorter
delivery time, local service work and/or faster response time as long as the
cost portion of its bid does not exceed up to ten percent (10%) of the cost
portion of the lowest evaluated bid, not to exceed five thousand dollars
($5,000.00). The preference percentage shall be determined by the City
Commission at the time the bid solicitation and bid specifications are
authorized, approved and advertised.
            2.   If all aspects of a responsible bid from a local business
entity are equal to the responsible bid from a non-local business entity, the
local business entity may be preferred as decided by the City Commission. The
local bidding preference is available only if the bid is awarded to the local
business entity at the local address.
            3.   The local preference may be waived upon written justification
and recommendation of the City Manager and approval of the City Commission.
         (f)   When the City Clerk receives the written memorandum, a full
review of the award recommendations will be made for compliance with these
policies and procedures; the City Clerk will resolve any award problems with
the using department and secure appropriate authorization with the approval of
the City Manager.
         (g)   The City Clerk reserves the right to reject any and all bids and
to waive any informalities and minor irregularities in the bids with the City
Manager’s approval. The City Manager may establish conditions under which
incomplete bids may be considered if it is determined that such waiver is in
the best interest of the city. Bids may be withdrawn only pursuant to the terms
of the Model Procurement Code.
   (B)   Any and all other written policies and procedures that are
inconsistent with this Manual are hereby amended to reflect the appropriate
changes approved herein.

(KRS 61.872(1))
   (C)   An applicant may inspect public records during the regular business
hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from the city
through the mail if the applicant’s residence or principal place of business is

for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records. (KRS 61.874(4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to division (G) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use. (KRS 61.874(5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means

the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;

Clerk/Tax Administrator shall so notify the applicant and shall furnish the
name and location of the official custodian of the public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 37.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed five (5) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 37.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence. (KRS 61.872(6))
§ 37.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within three (3) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
three (3) day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or
in part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian’s authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he or she shall proceed
under the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's
request, the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.
(KRS 61.880)
§ 37.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.
   No official or employee of the city shall willfully conceal or destroy any
record with the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these rules
and regulations.

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under
this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a
decision is made to take no action. The exemptions provided by this subdivision

incurred by the city in the procurement of natural gas to be sold to the city’s
distribution list. The city adders, listed below in division (B)(1), are
calculated by the City Finance and Utility Department or a qualified agency
contracted by the city. Any changes to the adder must be approved by the City
Commission. The city intends that any and all costs incurred by the city for
natural gas shall be recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis from the city’s
natural gas distribution customers. The total distribution rate shall be
calculated by taking the city adder and the gas cost, as calculated under
division (C). The updated distribution rates will be effective to customers on
the first day of the month, quarterly, starting January 1, 2010.
      (1)   City Adders:
         INSIDE CITY LIMITS
         First 2 MCF/Month      $12.00
         Over 2 MCF/Month      $ 2.715
         OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS
         First 2 MCF/Month      $12.750
         Over 2 MCF/Month      $ 3.4.65
   (C)   The gas cost component of the natural gas distribution rates shall
hereafter be referred to as the Gas Cost Recovery (GCR) rate. The GCR rate
shall be calculated on a quarterly basis commencing January 1, 2010 and is
composed of the Expected Gas Cost (EGC), which is explained below in division
(C)(1).
      (1)   The EGC represents the projected cost of natural gas per MCF for
the applicable quarterly period. The projected costs are to be inclusive of any
and all natural gas procurement costs to be incurred by the city including
commodity, transportation and any other ancillary costs.
      (2)   The most currently effective GCR rate shall be calculated thirty
(30) days prior to the effective date of the proposed rate. The total
distribution rates shall be automatically adjusted, either positively or
negatively, by the change in the currently effective GCR rate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the City
of Pikeville and enables the City to comply with all applicable State and
Federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the general
Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR, Part 403). The objectives of this chapter
are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system inadequately treated into
receiving waters so as to cause violations of the city’s KPDES permit or the
atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To promote the reuse, recycling and reclamation of wastewaters and
sludges from the treatment system;
      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance and replacement of the municipal wastewater system;
      (5)   To protect municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage,
sludge and/or effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting
the general public;
      (6)   To ensure that the municipality complies with its KPDES permit
conditions, sludge permit conditions, including use and disposal requirements,
and any other federal or state environmental laws to which the municipal
wastewater system is subject; and
      (7)   To reduce and/or eliminate in so much as is practical inflow and
infiltration of groundwater into the collection system.
   (B)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contribution to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits
to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements
for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires
user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
   (C)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the Pikeville municipal
wastewater system. Except as provided herein, the Pretreatment Coordinator, or
his/her designee, shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of
this chapter. Any powers granted to or imposed upon the Pretreatment
Coordinator may be delegated by the Pretreatment Coordinator to other city or
contractual personnel. By discharging wastewater into the municipal wastewater
system, all users located outside the city limits agree to comply with the
terms and conditions established in this chapter, as well as any permits,
enforcement actions or orders issued hereunder.

BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS
§ 52.045 PERMITS.
   (A)   There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits required; (a)
for residential and (b) for service to commercial and industrial
establishments. In either case, the owner(s) or his or her agent shall make
application on a special form furnished by the City of Pikeville. Applicants
for service to commercial and industrial establishments shall be required to
furnish information about all waste producing activities, wastewater
characteristics and constituents. The permit application shall be supplemented
by any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the
judgment of the City Manager. Details regarding commercial and industrial
permits shall include, but are not limited to, those required by this chapter.
Permit and inspection fees shall be paid to the city at the time the
application is filed.
   (B)   Users shall promptly notify the Pretreatment Coordinator in advance of
any introduction of wastewater constituents, a slug and/or accidental discharge
or any substantial change in the volume or character of the wastewater
constituents being introduced into the POTW. The Pretreatment Coordinator may
deny or place conditions on any new introduction or change in discharge, or
deny any slug/ accidental discharge based on the information submitted in the
notification or additional information as may be requested.
   (C)   No person(s) shall uncover, plug or make any connection with or
opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining permission from the Pretreatment Coordinator.
   (D)   A permit and inspection fee for residential, commercial and industrial
buildings shall be assessed by the city at the time the application is filed.
(Ord. O-2019-01, passed 1-28-19)
§ 52.046 PROHIBITED CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement wall
seepage or floor seepage, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other
surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in
turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. Any such
connections which already exist on the effective date of this chapter shall be
completely and permanently disconnected within sixty (60) days of the effective
date of this chapter. The owner(s) of any building sewers having such
connections, leaks or defects shall bear all costs incidental to removal of
such sources. Pipes, sumps, and pumps for such sources of ground and surface
water shall be separate from wastewater facilities. Removal of such sources of
water without presence of separate facilities shall be evidence of drainage to
public sanitary sewer. Connections shall be subject to inspection by the
Pretreatment Coordinator to verify compliance. Inspections may be performed
periodically at the discretion of the Pretreatment Coordinator or at the time
of connection/ reconnection.
   (B)   Floor, basement, or crawl space drains which are lower than ground
surfaces surrounding the building shall not be connected to the building
sanitary sewer. No sanitary inlet which is lower than six (6) inches above the
top of the lowest of the two adjacent public sanitary sewer manholes shall be
connected by direct drainage to the building sanitary sewer. Building sanitary
sewer connections in structures not meeting the criteria of this section will
be permitted only if the property owner has:
      (1)   Installed an individual pumping facility at the structure to
receive the building sewage. The pumping facility shall include a discharge
pipe with a high point which meets the criteria above; or
      (2)   Installed a minimum of two (2) sewer backflow stops or flaps at
least twelve (12) inches apart of such nature and design to provide gravity
flow to the sanitary sewer system and to prevent sewage backflow into the
property improvement.
(Ord. O-2019-01, passed 1-28-19)
§ 52.047 DESIGN AND INSTALLATION.
   (A)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway. The sewer
from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any
obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such
single connection aforementioned.
   (B)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the City Manager, to meet all
requirements of this chapter. Permit and inspection fees for new buildings
using existing building sewers shall be the same as for new building sewers. If
additional sewer customers are added to the old building sewers, additional
sewer tap fees shall be charged accordingly even though no new sewer tap is
actually made into the city system.
   (C)   Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customer’s
side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than that of the
customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be permitted.
   (D)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM A-74, latest
revision, PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) sewer pipe, ASTM C-700, latest revision, or
ductile iron pipe, A WW A specification C-151 cement lined, and shall meet all
requirements of the State plumbing code. Joints shall be as set out
hereinafter. Any part of the building sewer that is located within five feet of
a water service pipe shall be constructed with cast iron soil pipe or ductile
iron pipe, unless the building sewer is at least one foot deeper in the ground
than the water service line. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe may be
required by the city where the building sewer is exposed to damage or stoppage
by tree roots. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe shall be used in filled
or unstable ground, in areas where the cover over the building sewer is less
than three feet, or in areas where the sewer is subject to vehicular or other
external loads.
   (E)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the local and state building and plumbing codes and other applicable rules and
regulations of the city. Manholes may be required at all commercial and
industrial connections to the Pikeville municipal sewer system. The owner of
the facility shall be responsible for all costs associated with installation of
the manhole(s). Specifications for manholes may be obtained by contacting the
Pretreatment Coordinator.
   (F)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall
indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. Fees for connection shall
be as established by the city.
   (G)   The owner shall ensure that all excavations for building sewer
installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the city.
   (H)   In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the same building sewer.
Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary drainage shall be above
basement floor or in separately watertight or drained sump or channel and must
be inspected and approved by the Pretreatment Coordinator prior to connection
to the system.
   (I)   The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the
easement or property line. Where no property located service branch is
available, an authorized agent of the city shall cut a neat hole into the main
line of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle installed to receive
the building sewer. The invert of the building sewer at such point of
connection with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant of the main line of the
public sewer. A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner
surface of the public sewer, shall be made and the saddle made secure and
watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A
wye and H bend fitting shall be installed at the property line between the
public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a
cleanout and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After
testing, a cast iron or ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and
brought flush with the ground surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type
joint applicable to the pipe used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion
of ground or surface water.
   (J)   All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet or
exceed the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code.
   (K)   All persons working on city sewers with a cleaning rod must use an
approved type rod in cleaning sewer connections to city sewers.
(Ord. O-2019-01, passed 1-28-19)
§ 52.048 INSPECTION.
   (A)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the WWTP
Superintendent when the building sewer is ready for connection to the public
sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the WWTP
Superintendent or his representative. The connections shall be made gastight
and watertight and verified by proper testing.
   (B)   All building sewers shall be smoke tested through the wye branch at
the public sewer connection, with public sewer tightly plugged off, after
connections at both ends are made and after all pipe is properly bedded and
backfilled at least to top of pipe and if backfill is completed, within two
weeks after completion of backfill. At time of test, any openings into the
building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any
leakage of smoke from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be
located at test and repaired to stand repetition of smoke test without leakage.
Tests shall be performed at the expense of the property owner in the presence
of the WWTP Superintendent or his or her designee. When smoke testing is
completed, the temporary flow line plug shall be removed and a permanent water
tight plug shall be placed in branch of test wye-branch and carefully
backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six (6) inches above the top of the
branch.
(Ord. O-2019-01, passed 1-28-19)
POLLUTANT DISCHARGE LIMITS
§ 52.060 GENERAL CONDITIONS.
   The following described substances, materials, waters or wastes shall be
limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentration or quantities
which: will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment process or
equipment, will maintain and protect water quality in the receiving stream, and
will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a

§ 52.084 ALTERNATIVE DISCHARGE LIMITS.
   (A)   Where an effluent from a categorical industrial process(es) is mixed
prior to treatment with wastewater other than that generated by the regulated
process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge
permit by the Pretreatment Coordinator. These alternative limits shall be
applied to the mixed effluent and shall be calculated using the Combined
Wastestream Formula as defined in §
52.002.
   (B)   Where the effluent limits in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production
(production-based standard), the Pretreatment Coordinator may convert the
limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant
discharged per day or of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent permit limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be
subject to all permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c)
and must fully comply with these alternative limits.
   (C)   All categorical users subject to production-based standards must
report production rates annually so that alternative permit limits can be
calculated if necessary. The categorical user must notify the Pretreatment
Coordinator thirty (30) days in advance of any major change in production
levels that will affect the limits for the discharge permit.
   (D)   Where the city’s wastewater treatment system achieves consistent
removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may
apply to the Approval Authority for modification of specific limits in the
federal pretreatment standards. The city may modify pollutant discharge limits

wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Pretreatment Coordinator or
his representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, copying records, records
examination or in the performance of any of their duties.
   (B)   The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on
the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.140 GENERAL.
   (A)   The city, through the Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her designee,
to insure compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40 CFR
Subchapter N, and 401 KAR 5:055, may take the following enforcement steps
against users in non-compliance with the ordinance. The remedies available to
the POTW include injunctive relief, civil and criminal penalties, immediate
discontinuance of discharges and/or water service and the publishing of the
list of significant violators annually. The enforcement authority shall be
vested in the Pretreatment Coordinator or his/her designee.
   (B)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or an industrial user permit when such suspension is necessary, in
the opinion of the Pretreatment Coordinator, in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes
interference to the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its
NPDES/KPDES permit.
   (C)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the industrial user permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection and/or water service to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The city shall reinstate the industrial user permit and/or the
wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying
discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence shall be submitted to the city within fifteen (15) days of the date
of occurrence.
(Ord. O-2019-01, passed 1-28-19)
§ 52.141 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Any user found to be violating any provisions of this chapter,
wastewater permit, or any order issued hereunder, shall be served by the city
with written notice stating the nature of the violation(s). The user shall
submit a written explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted to the Pretreatment Coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of potential liability for any violation occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of the violation.
   (B)   If the violations persist or the explanation and/or plan are not
adequate, the city’s response shall be more formal and commitments (or
schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in an enforceable
document. The enforcement response selected will be related to the seriousness
of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if compliance is not
achieved expeditiously after the initial action. Identification of significant
non-compliance as defined in §
52.094, will require a formal enforcement action.
   (C)   The full scale of enforcement actions and implementation of such is as
detailed in the city’s enforcement response plan.
(Ord. O-2019-01, passed 1-28-19)
§ 52.142 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS.
   (A)   Any user who after receiving a notice of violation shall continue to
discharge in violation of this chapter or other pretreatment standards or
requirements or is determined to be a chronic or persistent violator or who is
determined to be a significant violator, shall be ordered to appear before the
city. At said appearance, a compliance schedule will be given to the non-
conforming user and an administrative fine assessed. The fine shall be
determined on a case-by-case basis which shall consider the type and severity
of violations, duration of violation, number of violations, severity of impact
on the POTW, impact on human health, the user’s economic benefit from
violation, history of violations, good faith of the user, and shall be a non-
arbitrary but appropriate amount.
   (B)   The administrative order may take any of the following three forms:
      (1)   Consent orders. The Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her designee
is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the
industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include
specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period also specified by the order. Consent Orders shall have the
same force and effect as orders issued pursuant to §
52.144.
      (2)   Compliance orders. When the Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her
designee finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the
ordinance or a permit or order issued hereunder, he or she may issue an order
to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following
a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been
installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other
requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology,
additional self-monitoring, and best management practices.
      (3)   Cease and desist orders. When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds
that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or
any permit or order issued hereunder, the Pretreatment Coordinator may issue an
order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in
noncompliance to: a) comply forthwith, or b) take such appropriate remedial or
preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or
threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the
discharge.
      (4)   Show cause hearing.
         (a)   The Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her designee may issue to
any user who causes or contributes to violations of this chapter, wastewater
permit or order issued hereunder, an order to appear and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the
Pretreatment Coordinator regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is
to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show
cause, before the Pretreatment Coordinator, why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days
before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of the
industrial user. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user or its
representative appears, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
         (b)   The city may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence,
or designate a representative to:
            1.   Issue, in the name of the city, notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in such hearing;
            2.   Take the evidence; and/or
            3.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city for
action thereon.
         (c)   At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony may be
taken under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded,
will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing
upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
         (d)   After the city has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order
to the user responsible for the violating discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, the sewer service will be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly
operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be
issued.

§ 52.143 ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any user who is found to
have violated any provision of this chapter, or permits or orders issued
hereunder, may be fined in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars
($5,000) per violation for each day in violation. Each day on which
noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct
violation. Such assessments may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer
service charge and the Pretreatment Coordinator shall have such other
collection remedies as needed to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges,
fines and penalties shall constitute a lien against the user’s property. Users
desiring to dispute such penalties must file a written request for the City
Manager of the city to reconsider the penalty within ten (10) business days of
being notified of the penalty. Where the City Manager believes an appeal has
merit, he or she shall convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen (15) days
of receiving the appeal from the user. The City Manager’s final decision shall
be binding.

user first files with it a satisfactory bond, payable to the POTW, in a sum not
to exceed a value determined by the Pretreatment Coordinator to be necessary to
achieve consistent compliance.
   (B)   Liability insurance. The Pretreatment Coordinator may decline to
reissue a permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the

UTILITY BILLING PROCEDURES
§ 54.05 UTILITY RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   All connections and all service shall be made on a fully metered basis
and free water service shall not be allowed or permitted to any customer,
including the city itself. Each place of residence and/or commercial entity
shall have separate meters and billing accounts.
   (B)   No connections to the water, gas or sewer pipes of the system shall be
made except by or under the supervision of a duly authorized officer, agent or
employee of the city and after approval of an application submitted with
required tap-on fee and any deposit that may be applicable. No service will be
installed unless there is a main distribution line existing along the road from
which service is required. If service is desired on the same side of the road
as the water main, the meter shall be installed within five (5) feet of the
water main, if feasible, or immediately adjacent to city easement on customer
side. If service is desired on the opposite side of the road from the water
main the service line will be run under the road and a meter installed on the
right-of-way at no additional cost other than the tap-on fee.
   (C)   The city shall read the utility meters monthly, on or about the first
through the seventeenth of each month, or as soon thereafter as may be
practical and feasible. Bills shall be mailed to customers for services on or
about the first of each month after reading the meters, or as soon thereafter
as may be practical and feasible.
   (D)   (1)   All customers are required to pay the amount of their bill in
full and without discount on or before the twentieth day of the month when
payment is due. Any outstanding balance of the utility account after the
twentieth day of the month shall be considered delinquent and a late payment
penalty of five percent (5%) of the current charge will be added to the
delinquent bill.
      (2)   If payment is not rendered by the close of business of the first
day of the following month that account will disconnected from service within
twenty-four (24) hours.
      (3)   Within three business days of the disconnect order, the deposit is
applied to the closed billing account. In order for the customer to have
service reconnected the entire outstanding balance of the account must be paid
in full. The customer will now be responsible for the delinquent months’
amount, the five percent (5%) late payment penalty, a reconnect charge, and a
deposit (if applicable and already applied to the customer’s account). An
administrative fee which will be the same charge as the reconnect charge will
be applied to the account regardless if service is disconnected in order to
cover the costs associated with maintaining the account in good standing.
      (4)   Example of billing process.
         (a)   For utility usage for the month of January, the meter will be
read between the first and seventeenth of February.
         (b)   Bills will be processed and mailed no later than March 1.
         (c)   Bill is due by March 20.
         (d)   If payment is not made on March 20, the account will be assessed
a five percent (5%) late payment penalty.
         (e)   Bill must be paid in full by April 1, or the next business day
thereafter.
         (f)   On April 2 service will be disconnected.
         (g)   By this time the customer will owe for February and March. The
customer would be required to pay all amounts due before service is reinstated.
         (h)   Total owed by the customer will be the bill for February and
March, and a reconnect fee.
   (E)   When a check, draft, note or other negotiable instrument received by
the Utility Department for payment of a utility account and is returned without
payment and/or dishonored for payment for non-sufficient funds or any other
reason, the account shall be treated as if no payment had been received and the
late payment penalty will be assessed pursuant to the provisions of division
(D) above. In the event of non-sufficient funds occurrence the account will be
charged an insufficient fund fee of thirty dollars ($30.00). If notification of
non-sufficient funds is after the twentieth of the month then the account shall
be classified as delinquent as outlined in division (D) above and the same
procedures shall be followed. The only additional application is the
insufficient fund fee.
   (F)   The city may disconnect service to a customer for the theft of
service, or for the appearance of theft devices on the premises of a customer.
The city shall not be required to restore service until the customer has
complied with all rules and regulations of the utility and Commission and the
city has been reimbursed for the estimated amount of services rendered and for
any cost incurred including service charges by reason of the fraudulent use as
may be determined by a court of proper jurisdiction.
   (G)   Customers who wish to have service disconnected must give at least
three (3) days’ notice to that effect; service will be discontinued (meter
removed) during working hours, Monday through Friday.
   (H)   A deposit for water and/or gas service as set by ordinance may be
required prior to service being connected. If a customer is moving from one
premise to another a deposit shall be transferred to the new property and the
unpaid balance from the prior bill be posted to the current bill. Upon twelve
(12) consecutive months of receipt of on time payments a customer's account may
be reviewed for refund of deposit to be applied to customer bill. Upon
termination of service, the deposit plus interest as set pursuant to KRS
278.460 by the KY Public Service Commission actually earned after the first
year will be applied to any unpaid bills of the customer if not previously
refunded, and if any balance or credit remains on the bill that amount will be
billed or refunded to the customer.
   (I)   (1)   The point of delivery is the point where the meter is located on
the customer’s premises or right-of-way. All water and gas lines, and equipment
beyond the meter shall be installed and maintained by the customer. All water
service lines beyond the meter setting should be installed of material
consisting of copper, polyethylene or PVC pipe with a rating of not less than
200 PSI. The size of service line beyond the point of delivery shall not be
less than three-fourths (3/4).
      (2)   All gas service lines beyond the meter shall consist of vinyl
coated steel on polyethylene pipe (ASTM D-2513, PE2406 or PE3406). Polyethylene
pipe shall not be permitted beyond the point of entry into the building or
foundation. The size of the service line beyond the point of delivery shall not
be less than one and one-fourth (1 1/4) inch. The customer shall install a
shut-off valve immediately adjacent to the meter on the customer’s side. If the
customer’s point of use is at a high elevation the customer may not receive
adequate pressure. The customer should consult with a reputable engineering
firm to size the service line from the point of delivery. System operator shall
determine the best location for meter, line, and the like, and need for new or
replacement of meter equipment.
   (J)   The customer must agree to permit the city to lay, maintain, repair or
remove such lines and meters which are the property of the city located on the
customer’s property with the right of ingress and egress over customer’s
property. The customer shall maintain the meter location, keeping it free of
debris and accessible to the meter readers or service personnel at all times.
If meters are not accessible to the meter readers the customer will be notified
in writing and the customer’s bill will be estimated no more than three (3)
times before being disconnected. The customer will be responsible for service
charges for disconnect and reconnect and the actual amount of usage registered
on the meter.
   (K)   The city will use reasonable consistency in supplying service, but
shall not be liable for breach of contract in the event of, or for loss, injury
or damage to persons or property resulting from interruption, excessive or
inadequate water pressure, or otherwise unsatisfactory service, whether or not
caused by negligence, as may be determined by a court of proper jurisdiction.
   (L)   As noted in division (B) above and by ordinance, metered service
connections are required by the city for each residential or commercial
building and no additional taps on the customer’s side of the meter are
allowed. Additions or changes in load are reviewed in order to determine theft
of service. Should theft of service be discovered, the customer shall be
responsible for the theft as well as any damage to any of the city’s lines or
equipment caused by the additional or changed installations.
   (M)   The customer shall notify the city immediately should the service be
unsatisfactory for any reason, or should there by any defects, trouble or
accidents affecting the water supply.
   (N)   The customer shall pay the cost of any special installation necessary
to meet the customer’s requirements for service other than the standard tap.
   (O)   No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break, damage,
destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure or equipment which is
part of the city’s public works including, specifically, metering equipment.
Any person violating this provision shall be subject to immediate
discontinuation of water service and shall pay the cost of repairing or
replacing the equipment.
   (P)   The city may, at the customer’s request, relocate and/or change
existing system- owned equipment. The customer shall reimburse the city for
such changes at actual cost.
   (Q)   There shall be one leak adjustment per customer per twelve (12) month
period. The customer must provide proof that a leak was present and repaired.
An adjustment shall be made for not longer than a one (1) month period. The
adjustment will be computed by the following formulas:
      (1)   Water:
         Total Usage                         $_________
         Normal Usage                      $_________
         Leak Usage                                   / 2 = adjustment
amount           
      (2)   Gas:
         Total Usage                         $_________
         Normal Usage                      $_________
         Leak Usage                                     
         Leak usage X *C/Gas rate  ( )    * Columbia Gas of Kentucky
         Adjustment amount      $
   (R)   Whenever a meter in service is found upon periodic request or
complaint test to be more than two percent (2%) fast, additional tests shall be
made at once to determine the average error of the meter. If the result of the
test shows an average error greater than two percent (2%) fast or two percent
(2%) slow, then the customer’s bill will be computed for the period in which
the meter error occurred. If the period in which the meter error existed is
unknown, then the bill will be computed for one-half of the elapsed time since
the last previous test, but in no case to exceed twelve (12) months. When a
meter is tested and it is found necessary to make a refund or back-bill a
customer, the customer shall be given written notification of the date,
location and results of the test, as well as the amount to be deducted from or
added to his or her regular bill.
   (S)   The city may disconnect service to any property which has failed to
comply with any city ordinances regarding utilities. At such time as public
sewer becomes available to a property served by a private wastewater disposal

disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a
written permit from the city or city agency.
   (T)   A separate sewer connection shall be provided for every building;
except where one (1) building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot.
   (U)   The charge for collection of garbage and trash shall be billed either
to the occupant of the property or the owner of the property as reflected in
the Pike County Property Valuation Administrator’s office. The city may
disconnect utility services to any property for which there is an unpaid

utility service bill issued by the city to the owner of the property in the
event that the occupant does not pay the fee, regardless of whether the utility
service bill in which the fee, if added for other utilities being supplied to
the property. The city may also disconnect to any person, regardless of whether
those utility services are connected to the property in which the outstanding
fee was incurred.

to service a private development shall be subject to a line extension agreement
executed between the developer and the city.
   (W)   In cases where a private developer transfers or assigns line
extensions and/or appurtenances to the city, the developer agrees to permit an
on-site inspector designated by the city
to inspect such lines and appurtenances during the construction phase of the
project. Such proposed plans of line extensions shall be submitted to proper
state authority for approval.
   (X)   A charge will be assessed for a trip to recheck a meter reading when

agreements herein contained, it is hereby understood and agreed by the parties
hereto as follows:
   The City shall install and maintain an alternative sewer system that has

limitations set out in the City’s Rules, Regulations and Ordinances now in
force or as hereafter amended, a sewer system in connection with user's
occupancy to the following described property:
   The user agrees to grant to the City, its successors and assigns, a

with right to erect, construct, install, and lay, and thereafter use, operate,
inspect, repair, maintain, replace, and remove sewer lines and appurtenant
facilities, together with the right to utilize adjoining lands belonging to the
user for the purpose of ingress to and egress from the above described lands.
   The user hereby agrees to utilize an alternative sewer system (fusion,
aerator, conventional septic tank or other) approved by the City and the Pike
County Health Department. The connection fee for the sewer system is

accordingly agrees that they will not permit any foreign objects or
concentrated chemicals to be introduced into the sewer system. The City is
responsible for the installation and routine maintenance of the alternative
system; however, if after inspection of a problem, it is found that improper
items were put into the sewer system by the user, the user shall be billed for
necessary repairs.
   User also agrees that the installation of electric service and routine
monthly charges from any power company associated with any electrical component

supplying sewer service, but shall not be liable for breach of contract in the
event of injury, damage to persons or property, or for loss resulting from
interruptions in service. The service connection supplied by the City to the

and shall commence to use sewer services of the system on the date the sewer
system is made available to the user by the City. Sewer user charges to the
user shall commence on the date service is made available, regardless of
whether or not the user connects to the system.

charges pursuant to this agreement shall result in the automatic imposition of
the following penalties:
      1.   Non-payment by the due date will be subject to a penalty of five

* The Commission for the City of Pikeville may adopt a resolution authorizing
that fees for residential gravity taps for up to an eight (8) inch line may be
adjusted or waived for all residential customers when the City of Pikeville
installs new sewer service into a residential area. The Commission shall set
the terms, conditions and time limit to sign a sewer service tap agreement to
qualify for the waived or reduced fees. The Commission’s elections hereunder
will be based upon the amount of grants or other funding received from third
parties for the sewer line extension, the number of customers per feet of new
sewer line, the contractor’s bid price/cost for the sewer line extension
project and sewer taps completed by the contractor during construction of the
sewer line or within sixty (60) days of completion of the project and the
amount the taxpayer contributes to the project.
 
   (D)   For residential, industrial, institutional and commercial users,
monthly user charges will be based on actual water usage. If a residential,
commercial, institutional or industrial user has a consumptive use of water,
or, in some other manner, uses water which is not discharged into the
wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based
on readings of a wastewater meter(s) or separate water meter(s) installed and
maintained at the user’s expense.

different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or “Go”: Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or “Caution” when shown following the green or
“Go” signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or “Stop”: Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or “Go” is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed
until it can do so without danger.

reduce its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection controlled by
such signal.
   (F)   “Yield Right-of-Way”: Vehicular traffic facing the “Yield Right-of-
Way” sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a “Yield Right-of-Way”
sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a speed in excess
of fifteen (15) miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not apply to
vehicles entering an expressway.
   (G)   Lane lights: When lane lights are installed over any street for the
purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing yellow lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from
that lane. Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles shall not move
against them. If flashing yellow lights show above a lane, that lane shall be
used only for passing and for left turns unless a sign at such place prohibits
such turn.

thereof.
Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.19 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNALS OR MARKINGS.

or in view of any street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the
movement of traffic, or which conceals or hide from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or signal. No
person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority permit on any

proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant
person.

SNOW EMERGENCY

   Whenever the City Manager or other authorized city official finds that
falling snow, sleet, or freezing rain will create a condition which makes it
necessary that the parking of motor vehicles on snow emergency routes be
prohibited or whenever he or she finds on the basis of a firm forecast of snow,
sleet, or freezing rain that the weather conditions so forecasted may create a
condition making it necessary that such parking be prohibited, he or she is
authorized to announce such prohibition, to become effective at a time
specified by him or her. After the effective time of such prohibition no person
shall park any vehicle or permit any vehicle to remain parked on a snow
emergency route. However, if a fall of snow, sleet, or freezing rain occurs

§ 72.099 ISSUANCE AND SALE OF REVENUE BONDS.
   (A)   The city may provide funds for the carrying out of the purposes
hereunder by the issuance and sale of revenue bonds. The city may, from the
proceeds of the bonds, reimburse its General Fund for any expenditures for such
purposes made by it before sale and delivery of the bonds. The bonds shall not
constitute an indebtedness of the city but shall be secured by such revenues as
the Board of Commissioners by ordinance provides. The Board of Commissioners
may pledge all or any part of one (1) or more of the following:
      (1)   The revenues derived from the property acquired or constructed from
the proceeds of such bonds;
      (2)   Any revenues of any other similar project whether acquired from the
proceeds of similar bonds or otherwise;
      (3)   Any revenues derived by the city from street parking meters.
   (B)   The bonds shall be designated on their face “Public Off-Street Parking
Facilities Revenue Bonds”. It shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond
that it has been issued under the appropriate statutory provisions and that it
does not constitute an indebtedness of the city within the meaning of any
constitutional provisions or limitations, or at all. The bonds shall be
authorized by ordinance of the Board of Commissioners. The bonds shall be
dated, shall bear interest at rates not exceeding six and one-half percent (6-
1/2%) per annum, shall be in the denominations, shall be payable at the place,
which may be at any bank within or without the Commonwealth, shall mature at
the time not exceeding forty (40) years from their date, and may be made
redeemable before maturity, at the option of the city, at prices and under the
terms and conditions, and shall be executed in the form and manner, all as
fixed by the Board of Commissioners prior to the issuance of the bonds. The
Board of Commissioners shall determine the form of the bonds, including any
interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the
bonds. In case any officer whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons
ceases to be such officer before the delivery of the bonds, such signatures
shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he
had remained in office upon delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupons in
registered form, or both, as the Board of Commissioners may determine, and
provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal
alone and also as to both principal and interest and for the reconversion of
any bond registered as to both principal and interest into coupon bonds. Such
bonds shall be exempt from taxation by the Commonwealth of Kentucky and by the
city and any political subdivision of the Commonwealth or the city to the
extent permitted by law. Such bonds may be issued without a vote of voters and
without any other proceedings, or happenings or any other conditions, or things
other than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified and
required by Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (C)   The Board of Commissioners may authorize the sale of the bonds in the
manner and for the price it determines to be for the best interest of the city,
but no sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of
interest on the money received therefor at more than six and one-half percent
(6-1/2%) per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the
bonds and in accordance with standard tables of bond values. If the proceeds of
the bonds by error or calculation or otherwise are less than the cost of the
facilities for which the bonds are authorized, additional bonds may in like
manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, unless otherwise
provided in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds, shall be
deemed to be of the same issue, and shall be entitled to payment from the same
funds without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. The ordinance
authorizing the bonds may make such other conditions and provisions therefor,
including provisions for the issuing of additional bonds and prescribing the
relative priority thereof as the Board of Commissioners deems desirable. Bonds
issued pursuant to the Kentucky Revised Statutes shall have and are hereby
declared to have, in the hands of a bona fide holder, all of the qualities of a
negotiable instrument under the Uniform Commercial Code.

§ 72.100 BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS TO FIX RATES FOR USE OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners shall fix and revise from time to time fees
rates, rentals, and charges for the use of the facilities constructed or
acquired hereunder, and such fees, rates, rentals, and charges shall be so
fixed and adjusted as to provide such funds as the Board of Commissioners deems
appropriate, but in no event shall the funds be less than sufficient to pay the
costs of maintaining, repairing, or operating the facilities, and paying the
interest on and the principal of the revenue bonds issued hereunder for the
construction or acquisition of such facilities, and to create necessary
reserves for the foregoing purposes. Upon the payment of all of the bonds
issued for any project the revenue from such project may be used for general
municipal purposes as determined by the Board of Commissioners.
   (B)   The rates or fees to be charged by the Parking Authority shall be
fixed at the lowest possible rates consistent with the achieving of the
purposes of this subchapter, which shall, together with any additional income,
defray the cost of maintaining, operating, and administering the parking
facilities, and of meeting the charges for principal and interest on any
indebtedness incurred under this subchapter, including reserves for such
purposes and a margin of safety.

PARKING CITATION ENFORCEMENT
§ 72.990 CITATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   If any motor vehicle is found parked, standing or stopped in violation
of any parking ordinance or other ordinance passed by the city, the vehicle may
be cited for the appropriate parking violation either in-person by a citation
officer, or through automated enforcement using automated license plate
recognition (ALPR) technology. If the vehicle is cited in-person by a citation
officer, the citing officer shall note the vehicle’s registration number and
any other information concerning the vehicle which will identify it and, if the
driver is not present, shall conspicuously affix to the vehicle a notice of
parking violation. If the vehicle is cited through automated enforcement, the
ALPR technology shall note the vehicle’s license plate number and any other
available information concerning the vehicle which will identify it, and shall
direct a citation to be sent to the mailing address on record with the Kentucky
Department of Motor Vehicles for the registered owner of the vehicle. Pursuant
to KRS 82.615(3) the registered owner of a vehicle at the time the violation
occurred shall be liable for all fines, fees and penalties issued hereunder.
   (B)   The form of the notice of the parking violation shall contain in
substance the following information:
      (1)   A statement that the notice represents a determination that a
parking violation has been committed by the owner of a vehicle and that the
determination shall be final unless contested as provided for in §
72.992 ;
      (2)   A statement that the parking violation may result in impoundment of
the vehicle for which the owner may be liable for a fine and towing, handling
and storage charges or fees;
      (3)   A statement of the specific parking violation for which the
citation was issued;
      (4)   A statement of the monetary penalty established for the parking
violation;
      (5)   A statement that the violator may contest the determination that a
violation occurred by requesting, in writing, the City Clerk for a hearing
before the hearing officer.
   (C)   A notice of parking violation represents a determination that a
parking violation has been committed, and such determination shall be final
unless contested as provided for in §
72.992 . The registered owner of the vehicle at the time the violation occurred
shall be liable for all fines, fees and penalties associated with the
violation. The fact that a vehicle which is illegally parked is registered in
the name of a person shall be considered prima facie proof that such person was
in control of the vehicle at the time of the violation. In the case of a
bailment or lease of a vehicle, the bailee and bailor and lessor and lessee
shall be jointly and severally liable for all fine, fees and penalties
associated with any violation.

such notice within twelve (12) days of the date of the notice, by either paying
the fine set forth in the notice or requesting a hearing pursuant to §

within seven (7) days of the receipt of the notice, the owner shall be deemed
to have waived his right to a hearing and the determination that a violation
was committed shall be considered final. Any person who fails to request a
hearing or pay the fine within the seven (7) days shall be deemed to have
refused to pay the fine levied by the citation.
   (C)   The registered owner of a vehicle at the time the violation occurred
shall be liable for all fines, fees and penalties which he has refused to pay.
   (D)   Failure to pay any fine, fees and penalties as provided for herein

contest the determination that a violation occurred by requesting in writing
with the City Clerk a hearing before the hearing officer, and tendering to the
City Clerk the fine set forth in the notice and hearing costs in the sum of ten
dollars ($10). Such hearing shall be held no later than thirty (30) days from
the date of receipt by the Clerk of the requests, unless prior to the hearing
the person requesting such hearing requests an extension of time not to exceed
thirty (30) days. No less than seven (7) days prior to the date prior to the
hearing, the City Clerk shall notify the registered owner of the vehicle of the
date, time and place of the hearing. Any person requesting a hearing who fails
to appear at the time shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a
hearing and the determination that a violation was committed shall be
considered final; further, the person shall be deemed to have refused to pay
the fine levied by the citation. In that event, the fine and hearing costs
submitted by the person requesting a hearing shall be retained in full by the
city.
   (B)   At the hearing, after consideration of the evidence, the hearing
officer shall determine whether a violation was committed. Where it has not
been established that the violation was committed, an order dismissing the
citation may be entered. In the event of a dismissal, the fine and hearing
costs tendered by the party requesting the hearing shall be returned
immediately by the city. Where it has been established that a violation was
committed, the hearing officer shall uphold the citation and the fine and
hearing costs submitted shall be retained in full by the city. A copy of such
order shall be furnished to the owner.
   (C)   The hearing officer may consider the parking citation and any other
written report made under oath by the officer who issued a citation in lieu of
the officer’s personal appearance at the hearing.
   (D)   An appeal from the hearing officer’s determination may be made to the
District Court of Pike County within seven (7) days of the date of the hearing
officer’s determination. The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a
complaint and a copy of the hearing officer’s order in the same manner as any
civil action under the Rules of Civil Procedure. The action shall be tried de
novo and the burden shall be upon the city to establish that a violation
occurred. If the Court finds that a violation did occur the city shall be
permitted to keep fine and hearing costs tendered to the city and shall recover
from the owner any court costs associated with the appeal. If the court finds
that a violation did not occur, the city shall be ordered to dismiss the
citation, return the fine and hearing costs tendered by the owner along with
his or her taxable costs of the appeal.
   (E)   The judgment of the District Court may be appealed to the Circuit
Court in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (F)   The city shall be authorized to employ on a part-time or full-time
basis an individual to serve as a hearing officer pursuant to this subchapter
at such compensation as the Board of Commissioners feels reasonable.

§ 72.993 IMPOUNDMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   (1)   The city may impound any motor vehicle parked, stopped or
standing upon a street or public way within the city in violation of any
ordinance or statute prohibiting parking, stopping or standing in the location,
manner or at the time the vehicle is cited for any other lawful reason.
      (2)   The city may also impound a motor vehicle or temporarily disable a
motor vehicle with the use of the device intended to temporarily prevent a
vehicle from being moved if said vehicle currently has three (3) unpaid
violations for which the appeal time has expired for thirty (30) days, and the
city has sent the owner of the vehicle as listed on the certificate of title a
notice as provided for in § 72.991(B) or if the vehicle has received greater
than three (3) citations in a thirty (30) day period. Every owner of a vehicle
who has received such notice or who allows his or her vehicle to receive three
(3) citations in a thirty (30) day period will have been deemed to have
knowledge of the city’s intention to collect delinquent fines, fees and
penalties for parking citations through the impoundment or temporary disabling
of the vehicle for which was issued a parking citation. The owner shall be
considered to have been given his due process before impoundment or temporary
disabling by virtue of his or her right to a hearing and notice thereof as
provided in §§ 72.991 and 72.992.
      (3)   The city, in addition to the fines, fees and penalties levied for
parking violations or hearing costs, shall be entitled to collect reasonable
towing, handling and storage charges for impounded vehicles.
      (4)   The Police Department, City Manager, or other city employee
designated by the City Manager are hereby authorized to impound a motor vehicle
pursuant to this section or have the vehicle moved and towed away by a
commercial towing service. Cars so impounded shall be stored in a safe place
and shall be returned to the owner or operator of such vehicle upon payment of
an impoundment and/or disabling fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00), and all
outstanding fines, fees and penalties assessed against the vehicle or its
owner, in addition to reasonable charges for towing and storage. Towing and
storage charges for commercial towing services shall be approved in advance by
the City Manager. A vehicle may be released to the owner or other person
entitled to possession only upon proof of ownership or right to possess. The
city may require reasonable security, bond or other assurances of
indemnification from a person who is not the registered owner of the vehicle
prior to release of the vehicle to such person.
      (5)   The owner of the motor vehicle which has been impounded or disabled
pursuant to this section or any other person entitled to possession, may
challenge the validity of such impoundment or disablement by request, in
writing, to the City Clerk for hearing before the hearing officer. The hearing
shall be conducted within ten (10) business days of the date of the request,
unless the owner or other person entitled to possession waives the limitation
or the city shows good cause for such delay. The city may retain possession of
the vehicle pending the hearing, unless the owner or other person claiming
right of possession posts a bond, with surety or cash in an amount equal to the
fines, fees, penalties and towing charges accrued against the vehicle or the
owner thereof as of the date of the hearing request, or one hundred dollars
($100.00), whichever is less. If the owner or person claiming possession of the
vehicle is unable to pay the amount of the bond, the hearing shall be held
within seventy two (72) hours of the date the requests for hearing is received,
unless such person requests or agrees to a continuance.
         (a)   No less than five (5) days prior to the date set for the
hearing, the city shall notify the person requesting the hearing of the date,
time and place of the hearing. In case the hearing is required to be held
within seventy two (72) hours of the date of the request as provided for in
division (A)(5) of this section, the person requesting the hearing shall be
informed at the time of his request, or as soon thereafter as practical, of the
date and time of the hearing.
         (b)   Any person who refuses, or except for good cause, fails to
appear at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have
conceded on his and the owner’s behalf the validity of the impoundment or
disablement.
         (c)   At the hearing, after consideration of the evidence, the hearing
officer shall determine whether the impoundment or disablement was valid and
reasonable. Where it has not been established that the impoundment was
justified, an order releasing the vehicle shall be entered. All towing and
storage fees and towing and/or impoundment fees paid or amounts posted as bond
because of the impoundment or disablement of the vehicle shall be returned. If
the hearing officer also determines that violation was not committed, the fine
and penalty shall also be returned. Where it has been established that the
impoundment or disablement was justified, the hearing officer shall uphold the
impoundment or disablement and condition the release of the vehicle upon
payment of all fines, penalties and fees accruing thereto. If bond has been
posted as security for release of the vehicle, the bond shall be forfeited to
the city. Any fines or fees in excess to the amount of the bond posted shall be
ordered to be paid by the owner of the vehicle to the city. The hearing officer
shall furnish the owner or person appearing on the owner’s behalf with a copy
of his or her order.
         (d)   A hearing officer may consider a parking citation and any other
written report made under oath by the issuing officer in lieu of the officer’s
personal appearance at the hearing.
         (e)   An appeal from the hearing officer’s determination may be made
as provided for in §
72.992 (D).
   (B)   (1)   If within ten (10) business days of the impoundment or temporary
disablement a motor vehicle impounded or disabled by the city has not been
claimed, or a hearing has not been requested pursuant to division (A), notice
shall be mailed by certified mail to the registered owner, if known, and

towing service, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by them or anyone for
whose acts any of them may be liable.

§ 92.16 ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS.
   The following requirements shall govern all enforcement proceedings before

   (A)   Enforcement proceedings shall only be initiated by the issuance of a
citation by a Code Enforcement Officer.
   (B)   Except when immediate action is necessary pursuant to §
92.24(A) or to the extent modified in §
92.24(B) Commercial Premise Nuisances, if a Code Enforcement Officer believes,
based on his or her personal observation or investigation, that a person has
violated a city ordinance, he or she may issue a notice of violation allowing
the alleged violator seven (7) days to remedy the violation without incurring a
fine. If the alleged violator fails or refuses to remedy the violation within
the time specified, the Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to issue a
citation for the first offense. If the violation is not remedied within seven
(7) days of the citation for the first offense the Code Enforcement Officer
shall issue a citation for second offense. If the violation is not remedied
within three (3) days of the issue of the second offense the Code Enforcement
Officer may issue a citation for each day thereafter that the violation
remains. All fines shall be as prescribed in §
92.20.

then he or she may complete a plan of action with the property owner to
describe what action must be taken to remedy the violation and the date by
which it shall be completed by the property owner. During the time period that
the plan of action is in place, all fines and fees shall continue to be
assessed and accrue. If the property owner defaults on the plan of action, in
part or in whole, then all fines and fees assessed up to the time of default
and any additional fines and fees assessed shall become due immediately upon
default. If the property owner follows the plan of action and remedies the
violation in accordance with the terms of the plan, then the fines shall be
reduced, upon remedy of the violation, to the amount of fines and fees due at
the time when the plan of action was begun. Any plan of action must be approved
by the City Manager or designee and the property owner. The property owner’s
signature will be considered acceptance of the terms and provisions provided
for in the plan.
   (D)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall issue the citation by one (1) of
the following methods:
      (1)   Personal service to the alleged violator;
      (2)   Leaving a copy of the citation with any person eighteen (18) years
of age or older who is on the premises, if the alleged violator is not on the
premises at the time the citation is issued; or
      (3)   Posting a copy of the citation in a conspicuous place on the
premises and mailing a copy of the citation by regular, first-class mail to the
owner of record of the property, if no one is on the premises at the time the
citation is issued.
   (E)   The citation issued by the Code Enforcement Officer shall contain the
following information:
      (1)   The date and time of issuance;
      (2)   The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued;

      (8)   The civil fine that may be imposed for the violation;
      (9)   The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil
fine or to contest the citation; and
      (10)   A statement that if the person fails to pay the civil fine set
forth in the citation or contest the citation within the time allowed: the
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing before the Code
Enforcement Board or Hearing Officer to contest the citation; the determination
that the violation was committed shall be final; the citation as issued shall
be deemed a final order determining that the violation was committed and
imposing the civil fine as set forth in the citation; and the person shall be
deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court.
   (F)   After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall notify the Code Enforcement Board by delivering the citation to
the Code Enforcement Board Clerk.
   (G)   (1)   The person to whom the citation is issued shall respond to the
citation within seven (7) days of the date of issuance by either paying the
civil fine or requesting, in writing, to the City Clerk at the address
maintained for City Hall, a hearing to contest the citation. If the request for
a hearing to contest a citation is mailed to the City Clerk, the request must
be postmarked by the United States Post Office or other publicly recognized
delivery service on or before the deadline. The request for a hearing shall
provide the requester’s true and accurate mailing address and telephone number.
If the person fails to respond to the citation within seven (7) days, the
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation was committed shall be considered final. In this
event, the citation as issued shall be deemed a final order determining that
the violation was committed and imposing the civil fine as set forth in the
citation, and the person shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the
final order to District Court.
      (2)   Notice of the final order shall be delivered to the cited violator
by regular first-class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; personal
delivery; or by leaving the notice at the person's usual place of residence
with any individual residing therein who is eighteen (18) years of age or older

to the person who issued the expulsion notice.

§ 100.03 UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES; WRITE-OFFS.
   (A)   Uncollectible accounts policies and procedures.
      (1)   The Ambulance Service shall develop policies and procedures which
will appropriately and uniformly identify uncollectible accounts among the
citizens of Pikeville.
      (2)   It shall be the policy of the Ambulance Service to provide, without
charge, ambulance transportation to those that have an essential need for
emergency or non-emergency transportation but are unable to pay for such
transportation. The awarding of without charge services will be based on a set
of consistent criteria and will be available to all recipients of service.
   
      (3)   WITHOUT CHARGE SERVICE shall be defined as ambulance
transportation, either emergency or non-emergency, which has been determined as
medically necessary by the patient’s physician, that is given without the
expectation of payment, as a result of an in-depth financial investigation.
      (4)   The Ambulance Service will budget without charge services of an
amount not to exceed three percent (3%) of gross patient service revenues or
whenever possible to do so without jeopardizing its own financial stability.
      (5)   The procedure for application for without charge services shall be
drafted and approved by the administrative staff, city officials. A copy of
such shall be attached to or included with Ord. 0-04-02, passed - -04.
      (6)   The Director shall not approve any account adjustment which has not
met the criteria of established procedures.
      (7)   The Director or his or her designee may approve applications for
without charge service after review and recommendation of billing staff,
subject to the following limitations:
         (a)   Accounts falling within Federal Poverty Guidelines or
extenuating circumstances could be discounted fifty percent (50%) to one
hundred percent (100%) at the discretion of the designated authority.
         (b)   Accounts in which total adjustment would be one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or less.
      (8)   Accounts requiring authorization of the City Manager and
authorization of the Director:
         (a)   Accounts which are considered exception to routine policy and
procedure.
         (b)   Accounts in which the total adjustment would be one thousand
dollars and one cent ($1,000.01) or greater.
      (9)   Billing staff may make no ledger adjustment for without charge
cases without appropriate documentation of application, conforming to the above
guidelines.
   (B)   Write-offs.
      (1)   All write-offs are at the discretion of the City of Pikeville
Ambulance Service with the exception of the following:
         (a)   Medicaid. All providers who participate with Medicaid are
required to write-off the difference of the allowed amount and cannot bill the
patient.
         (b)   Medicare. All providers who participate with Medicare are
required to write-off the difference of the allowed amount and cannot bill the
patient. Medicare guidelines require all providers “reasonably attempt” to
collect from the patient their twenty percent (20%) copay. After three (3)
statements are sent to the patient, this is a “reasonable attempt.” If the
patient has not paid by three (3) months after they have been billed, they are
not likely to pay. (Need to be looked at to decide action.)
         (c)   Private insurance. Once the insurance has paid their portion,
the patient is immediately sent an itemized bill for the balance due. After the
third statement is sent, a phone call is made to set the patient’s account on a
payment plan. If this effort is not successful, the account needs to be looked
at to determine if it should be turned over to a collection agency or place a
block on the patient’s credit.
         (d)   Self-pay patients. The first bill sent is an itemized bill. The
next two (2) are statements. A phone call is then made to try to set the
patient’s account on a payment plan. If this effort is not successful, the
account needs to be looked at to determine if it should be turned over to a
collection agency, or place a block on the patient’s credit.
         (e)   Homeless shelter patients. If the patient has insurance
coverage, accept what the insurance pays and write-off the balance as
“uncollectible.” If the patient does not have insurance, send one (1) itemized
bill. If no response, write-off the balance as “uncollectible.”
         (f)   Accounts that are over eighteen (18) months due with balances
less than fifty dollars ($50.00) can be looked at by the Director for write-off
or turned over to collection process at his or her discretion.
         (g)   Invalid addresses. If a correct address cannot be obtained or
resolution for this type of account cannot be accomplished within one hundred
twenty (120) days, it is to be placed on patient’s credit report.

be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) city, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) below, plus the sales
factor, described in division (C) below, and the denominator of which is two
(2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) city,
by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in division (C)
of this section.
      (3)   For purposes of this division (A), the business entity shall file
an apportionment form provided by the Occupational Tax Office.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government. Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or
rental of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property,

the time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and
the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-
producing activity.
         (c)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property
is allocated to the city where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will
fairly represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or

allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this division
(E), the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.

withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who

required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational

corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
division (H) unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account
for, or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes
imposed by this chapter become or became due.
   (I)   Every employee receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax
imposed under §
115.03 shall be personally liable for the tax notwithstanding the provisions of
divisions (G) and (H) of this section. In all cases where the employer does not
withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee, such employee or
employees shall be responsible for filing with the city each quarter in the
same manner as if they were the employer. If an employer fails to or is not
required to withhold, report, or pay the license tax, it shall become the duty
of the employee, to file with the city. The only employer not required to
withhold, report, and pay the occupational license tax is the federal
government including the United States Postal Service. The payment required to
be made by an employee, can be made quarterly, for the periods ending March 31,
June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, or at any time the
employee wishes to make an estimated payment or the year in which wages are
earned. All license taxes must be received by April 15 for the preceding
calendar year, together with a copy of the employee’s W-2 form. Employers not
required to withhold, report, or pay the license tax must annually during the

each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar year, giving the
amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation earned during such
preceding year by each such employee. This list shall include all current full
time employees, part time employees, temporary employees, and terminated
employees whether it be voluntary or involuntary.

city or its designated agent.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax

of reports of adjustments made by the federal government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns, and comply with rules as the city from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems sufficient to
determine the tax liability the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the taxable income
of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business
entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.

appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the city at the time

employee compensation” payments to natural persons other than employees for
services performed within the city, to maintain records of such payments and to
report such payments to the city. Those payments must be reported on by
remitting IRS Form 1099 by February 28 of the year following the close of the
calendar year in which the non-employee compensation was paid. If a business
entity or person is not required to remit IRS Form 1099 to the IRS, including
but not limited to those making non-employee payments of less than six hundred
dollars ($600.00), such entity or person is nevertheless required to remit the

§ 115.13 MINIMUM LIABILITY.
   (A)   In the event the tax payment required under §
115.03 is less than an amount sufficient to yield an annual license tax
calculated at two percent (2%) of net income, equal to or in excess of the
minimum license taxes set forth below, then the tax provided by the
occupational license tax ordinance applicable to the licensee’s trade,
occupation or profession shall apply and be charged as a minimum license tax
hereunder.
   (B)   Except as otherwise required or exempt herein, the minimum license
taxes provided by the occupational license tax ordinance are $50 per year for
all business types, or $25 for three (3) days for agents, representatives, or
solicitors taking or soliciting orders or making sales.

§ 115.14 CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS.
   (A)   General contractors must pay in advance at the time of issuance of a
job permit/building permit a minimum license tax in the amount of one quarter
of one percent (0.25%) of the total contract consideration stated in the
contract or agreement for labor, services or materials agreed to be provided by
the contractor, his or her employees, subcontractors, agents, and the like,
including amendments, change orders or additions thereto.
   (B)   No minimum license tax will be due from any contractor whose taxes or
compensation is included as a part of a general contractor’s total contract
consideration. The contractor will be required to file a net profits license
tax return and to withhold occupational license tax from any employees
performing work in the city.
   (C)   In the event that any contractor’s tax or compensation is not included
as part of the general contractor’s total contract consideration for which a
minimum license tax has been paid, the contractor’s total contract
consideration will be subject to the minimum license tax, and will be payable
by the contractor.
   (D)   Property owners (“owner”) who act as general contractor on their
construction projects must pay the minimum license tax on the total estimated
cost of construction before they will be issued a building permit. As the owner
contracts with others to perform parts of the construction, those contractors
will be required to pay the minimum license tax on the contract that they
receive. It is the owner’s responsibility to inform each contractor that they
are liable for the minimum license tax. Each subcontract will be considered a
general contract for the purpose of the minimum license tax. The owner should
obtain the contractor’s city license number, name, address, and taxpayer
identification number (TIN) and maintain a record of all contractors and the
total compensation paid. When construction is completed, the record of
contractors is submitted to the city, and if all the contractors have paid the
required minimum license tax as described above, the owner will be refunded the
minimum license tax. If all contractors have not paid the required minimum
license tax, the minimum license tax will be retained to the extent that the
minimum has not been collected on the total cost of construction.
   (E)   Minimum license tax paid by contractors may be claimed as a credit
against tax due on the contractor’s net profits return. Contractors may, at
their option, apply minimums on a contract by contract basis, thus allowing
them to carry a portion minimum tax paid in one (1) year to subsequent years as
the contract is completed. When a contract is completed all minimums remaining
will be applied in that tax year. The contractor must apply minimum tax based
on the percentage of completion of each contract and on appropriate forms
supplied by the Occupational Tax Administrator. No refund shall be made if the
minimum tax exceeds the license tax calculated on the net profits return.

§ 115.99 INTEREST AND PENALTY.
   (A)   Delinquent payments hereunder shall incur interest in an amount equal

the due date prescribed for payment or fails to pay 75% or greater of the tax
due on the return as a estimated tax pursuant to §

accessed upon the difference of the estimated tax paid and the tax computed on
the return.
      (3)   An additional five percent (5%) penalty will be assessed for each
additional thirty (30) day period or fraction thereof for which a business
entity subject to tax on net profits fails to comply with (B)(1) or (2). The
total penalty levied pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed twenty- five
percent (25%) of the total tax due; however, the penalty shall not be less than
twenty five dollars ($25.00). For example, if a return is due on April 15th, on
April 16th a five percent (5%) penalty will be assessed, not prorated daily. On
May 17th, another five percent (5%) penalty will be assessed and so on for a
maximum penalty imposed of twenty-five percent (25%) of the total tax due.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to file a return or pay the tax on or before
the time prescribed under §
115.05 may be subject to a penalty in amount equal to five percent (5%) of the
tax due for each month or fraction thereof. An additional five percent (5%)
penalty will be assessed for each additional thirty (30) day period or fraction
thereof for an employer who fails to file a return or pay the tax on or before
the time prescribed in §
115.05 (see example in (B)(3) for calculation. The total penalty levied
pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the
total tax due; however, the penalty shall not be less than twenty-five dollars
($25.00).
   (D)   In addition to the penalties prescribed in this section, any business
entity or employer shall pay, as part of the tax, an amount equal to twelve
percent (12%) per annum simple interest on the tax shown due, but not
previously paid, from the time the tax was due until the tax is paid to the
city. A fraction of a month is counted as an entire month.
   (E)   Every tax imposed by this chapter, and all increases, interest, and
penalties thereon, shall become, from the time the tax is due and payable, a
personal debt of the taxpayer to the city.
   (F)   The city may enforce the collection of the occupational tax due under
§
115.03 and any fees, penalties, and interest as provided in divisions (B)
through (E) by civil action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction. To the
extent authorized by law, the city shall be entitled to recover all court costs
and reasonable attorney fees incurred by it in enforcing any provision of this
chapter.

entity or employer who willfully fails to make a return or willfully makes a
false return, or who willfully fails to pay taxes owing or collected, with the
intent to evade payment of the tax or amount collected, or any part thereof,
shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
   (H)   Any person who willfully aids or assists in, or procures, counsels, or
advises the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with, any
matter arising under this chapter of a return, affidavit, claim, or other
document, which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter, whether or
not the falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person
authorized or required to present the return, affidavit, claim, or document,
shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
   (I)   A return for the purpose of this section shall mean and include any
return, declaration, or form prescribed by the city and required to be filed
with the city by the provisions of this chapter, or by the rules of the city or
by written request for information to the business entity by the city.

imprisoned for not longer than six (6) months, or both.
   (K)   Any person violating the provisions of §
115.11 by divulging confidential taxpayer information shall be fined not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than one (1)

payment of the taxes set forth in this section and the payment is dishonored,
returned for non-sufficient funds (NSF) or charged back to the city account for
any reason shall be charged a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) in addition to any

the city account for any reason shall be treated as if payment had not been
received and penalties and interest for non-payment provided for herein shall
be charged.
   (M)   Amnesty program.
      (1)   A taxpayer amnesty, waiver, or forgiveness of penalties and
interest is established under this section for failure to file any return or
report on or before the due date prescribed for filing or as extended by the
city, or failure to pay the tax computed on the return or report on or before

(60) days commencing from the date that the application is received by the
Planning Commission, or within a date specified in a written agreement between
the Planning Commission and the applicant, make its final decision to approve
or disapprove the uniform application. If the Planning Commission fails to
issue a final decision within sixty (60) days, and if there is no written
agreement between the Planning Commission and the utility to a specific date
for the Planning Commission to issue a decision, it shall be presumed that the
Planning Commission has approved the utility’s uniform application.
(Ord. 2004-015, passed 8-23-04)
REGULATORY PROVISIONS
§ 120.20 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The applicant shall provide information demonstrating compliance with the
following requirements. Where the Planning Commission finds that circumstances
or conditions relating to the particular application are such that one (1) or
more of the requirements listed below are not necessary or desirable for the
protection of surrounding property or the public health, safety, and general
welfare, and that such special conditions or circumstances make one (1) or more
of the requirements unreasonable, the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, may modify or waive such requirement, either
permanently or on a temporary basis. Any such modification or waiver shall be
requested by the applicant, and the applicant shall submit a written
justification for each requested modification or waiver.
   (A)   Monopole cellular antenna towers shall be permitted in any area or
zone. Lattice and guyed cellular antenna towers shall be permitted in any zone
except for residential areas or zones. Monopole cellular antenna towers in
residential areas or zones shall be limited to one hundred (100) feet in
height, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission as approved as a
variance request and as part of the required development plan.
   (B)   Lattice and guyed cellular antenna towers constructed in an other zone
shall be located a minimum distance of not less than two hundred fifty (250)
feet from all existing residential structures.
   (C)   Setbacks for all structures constructed in connection with cellular
antenna towers, except fences and/or guy wires, shall be a minimum distance
from the property line or lease line equal to the setback of the respective
district plus one-half (1/2) the height of the tower. All structures
constructed in connection with stealth towers shall comply with the applicable
setback requirements established for other structures within the applicable
zoning district. Stealth towers that are to be located as part of a utility
service facility (e.g., power pole or telephone pole) shall comply with setback
requirements applicable to such utility service facilities, if any. No tower
may be located closer than fifty (50) feet to any property line.
   (D)   A cellular antenna tower, or alternative antenna tower structure, may
be constructed to a maximum height of two hundred (200) feet regardless of the
maximum height requirements listed in the specific zoning district. This also
applies to any tower taller than fifteen (15) feet constructed on the top of
another building or structure, with the height being the overall height of
building/structure and tower together, measured from the grade at ground level
to the highest point of the tower. The Planning Commission may allow antennas
greater than two hundred (200) feet in height upon review of the applicant’s
justification that the additional height meets the criteria identified in §
120.21.
   (E)   The cellular antenna tower shall be constructed in compliance with the
current ANSI/EIA/TIA 222-F standards and other applicable state standards.
   (F)   Cellular antenna towers shall not be illuminated, except in accordance

points as shown on the approved development plan subject to the entrance
requirements outlined in the Subdivision and Development Regulations or of the
applicable KYTC-District (where applicable).
   (H)   Woven wire or chain link (eighty percent (80%) percent open) or solid
fences made from wood or other materials (less than fifty percent (50%) percent
open) shall be used to enclose the site. Such fences shall not be more than
eight (8) feet in height. The use of barbed wire or sharp pointed fences shall
be prohibited. Such fence may be located within the front, side, or rear yard.
   (I)   Screening shall be provided by evergreen trees, with a minimum height
of six (6) feet, planted in a staggered pattern at a maximum distance of ten
(10) feet on center. The Planning Commission may increase the distance between
plantings based on the type (species) of evergreen tree and its growth
characteristics. The screening shall be placed in an area between the property
line, or lease line, and a ten (10) foot setback. A break in the hedge, not to
exceed fifteen (15) feet in width, shall be allowed for access of maintenance
personnel and vehicles.
   (J)   Surfacing of all driveways and off-street parking areas shall comply
with the requirements of the applicable Subdivision and Development Regulations
and be at least constructed of gravel or other durable surface. The Planning
Commission may require alternative surface materials based on grade,
construction and potential for erosion.

   (A)   Approval or disapproval of the proposal shall be based upon an
evaluation of the proposal’s agreement with the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning
Ordinance and applicable Subdivision and Development Regulations.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may require the applicant to make a reasonable
attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or related equipment. The Planning
Commission may provide the location of existing cellular antenna towers on
which the Commission deems the applicant can successfully co-locate its
transmitting and related equipment. If the Planning Commission requires the
applicant to attempt co-location, the applicant shall provide the Planning
Commission with a statement indicating that the applicant has:
      (1)   Successfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to host
multiple wireless service providers’ facilities or existing structures such as
a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of supporting
the applicant’s facilities, and that identifies the location of the tower or
suitable structure on which the applicant will co-locate its transmission and
related facilities; or
      (2)   Unsuccessfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to host
multiple wireless service providers’ facilities or existing structures such as
a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of supporting
the applicant’s facilities and that:
         (a)   Identifies the location of the towers or other structures on
which the applicant attempted to co-locate; and
         (b)   Lists the reasons why the co-location was unsuccessful in each
instance.
   (C)   The Planning Commission may deny a uniform application to construct a
cellular antenna tower based on an applicant’s unwillingness to attempt to co-
locate additional transmitting or related equipment on any new or existing

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 121.01 FINDINGS; INTENT.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners finds that:
      (1)   In June 2006 the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report reviewing the
health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke. The report
concluded that:
         (a)   Secondhand smoke causes premature death and disease in children
and adults who do not smoke;
         (b)   Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk
for sudden death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory infections, ear problems
and more severe asthma;
         (c)   Exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse
effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung
cancer;
         (d)   The scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free
level of exposure to secondhand smoke;
         (e)   Many millions of Americans, both children and adults, are still
exposed to secondhand smoke;
         (f)   Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects nonsmokers
from exposure to second hand smoke.
      (2)   Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major
contributor to indoor air pollution. Breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of
disease in healthy nonsmokers. These diseases include heart disease, stroke,
respiratory disease and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined
in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to
65,000 Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), “Health effects of
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California
Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10,”
Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI),
August 1999.)
      (3)   The Public Health Service’s National Toxicology Program (NTP) has
listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health
Information Service (EHIS), “Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the
Ninth Report on Carcinogens,” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS), Public Health Service, NTP, 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent
reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005.)
      (4)   Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to the elderly,
individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway
disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma,
respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental
abnormalities, and cancer. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal
EPA), “Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke”, Tobacco
Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.)
      (5)   The Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates access to
public places and workplaces for persons with disabilities, deems impaired
respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., “Environmental tobacco
smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act,” Nonsmokers’ Voice 15(1):8-9.)
      (6)   The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand
smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of
ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate
matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand
smoke. (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), “Indoor air facts no. 5
environmental tobacco smoke,” Washington, D.C.: Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), June 1989.)
      (7)   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that
the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated
with exposure to tobacco smoke is non-linear at low doses, increasing rapidly
with relatively small doses such as those received from secondhand smoke or
actively smoking one (1) or two (2) cigarettes a days and has warned that all
patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary
artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking.
(Pechacek, Terry F.; Babb, Stephen, “Commentary: How acute and reversible are
the cardiovascular risks of secondhand smoke?” British Medical Journal, 328:
980-983, April 24, 2004.)
      (8)   A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the
workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five
percent (25%) to fifty percent (50%) higher risk of heart attack and higher
rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased
acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function (Pitsavos,
C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C. Skoumas, J; Tzioumis, K; Stefanadis, C.;
Toutonzas, P. “Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and
the development of acute coronary syndromes: The CARDIO2000 case-control
study,” Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.)
      (9)   Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to
respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs,
increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases
related to exposure to secondhand smoke. (“The high price of cigarette
smoking,” Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.)
      (10)   A study of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in
Helena, Montana before, during, and after a local law eliminating smoking in
workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce
smoke-free workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in
morbidity from heart disease. (Sargent, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M.; Glantz,
Stanton A., “Reduced incidence of admissions for myocardial infarction
associated with public smoking ban: before and after study,” British Medical
Journal 328: 977980, April 24, 2004.)
      (11)   Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts
and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or
appositive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be
smoke-free. Creation of smoke-free workplaces is sound economic policy and
provides the maximum level of employee health and safety. (Glantz, S.A.; Smith,
L., The Effect of Ordinances Requiring Smoke-Free Restaurants on Restaurant
Sales in the United States. American Journal of Public Health, 87:1687-1693,
1997; Colman, R.; Urbonas, C.M., “The economic impact of smoke-free workplaces:
an assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco Control Unit, Nova Scotia
Department of Health,” GPI Atlantic, September 2001.)
      (12)   Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns
and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures cause economic damage to business
health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.)
      (13)   The smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a danger to
health and a material public nuisance.
      (14)   The use of electronic smoking devices has increased significantly
in recent years, as evidenced by the fact that:
         (a)   Between 2011 and 2012 the percentage of all youth in grades 6 to
12 who had tried electronic smoking devices doubled;
         (b)   Six and eight tenths percent (6.8%) of all youth between sixth
and twelfth grades report trying electronic smoking devices;
         (c)   Ten percent (10%) of high school students have tried electronic
smoking devices;
         (d)   Nine and three tenths percent (9.3%) of youth who have used
electronic smoking devices have never smoked conventional cigarettes; and
         (e)   Between 2010 and 2011, rates of both awareness and use of
unregulated electronic smoking devices by adults also increased significantly.
      (15)   Existing studies on electronic smoking devices’ vapor emissions
and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including:
         (a)   Chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer such
as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, lead, nickel, and chromium; PM2.5, acrolein,
tin, toluene, and aluminum, which are associated with a range of negative
health effects such as skin, eye, and respiratory irritation, neurological
effects, damage to reproductive systems, and even premature death from heart
attacks and stroke;
         (b)   Inconsistent labeling of nicotine levels in electronic smoking
device products; and
         (c)   In one (1) instance, diethylene glycol, an ingredient used in
antifreeze and toxic to humans.
      (16)   More than one (1) study has concluded that exposure to vapor from
electronic smoking devices may cause passive or secondhand vaping.
      (17)   Some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be re-
filled with liquid nicotine solution, creating the potential for exposure to
dangerous concentrations of nicotine, and as a result:
         (a)   Poisonings from electronic smoking devices have increased
dramatically in the last three and a half (3 ½) years from “one (1) a month in
September 2010 to two hundred and fifteen (215) a month in February 2014;" and
         (b)   Analysis of reports of poisonings from electronic smoking
devices finds that calls reporting exposure to electronic smoking devices are
much more likely to involve adverse health effects when compared to calls
reporting exposure to conventional cigarettes.
      (18)   Clinical studies about the safety and efficacy of these products
have not been submitted to the FDA for the more than four hundred (400) brands
of electronic smoking devices that are on the market and for this reason,
consumers currently have no way of knowing:
         (a)   Whether electronic smoking devices are safe;
         (b)   What types or concentrations of potentially harmful chemicals
the products contain; and
         (c)   What dose of nicotine the products deliver.
      (19)   The World Health Organization has strongly advised consumers
against the use of electronic smoking devices until they are “deemed safe and
effective and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory body.”
      (20)   The World Medical Association has determined that electronic
smoking devices “are comparable to scientifically-proven methods of smoking
cessation” and that “neither their value as therapeutic aids for smoking
cessation nor their safety as cigarette replacements is established.”
      (21)   A study published in the Journal of Environmental and Public
Health suggests that electronic smoking devices “may have the capacity to ‘re-
normalize’ tobacco use in a demographic that has had significant
denormalization of tobacco use previously.”
      (22)   Electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco
products in shape, size, and color, with the user exhaling a smoke-like vapor
similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other
conventional tobacco products.
      (23)   The use of electronic smoking devices in smoke-free locations
threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the
progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not
permitted in public places and places of employment.
   (B)   The Board of Commissioners adopts the foregoing findings of fact as
the Board’s basis for its action, and states that the purpose of the adoption
of this chapter is:
      (1)   To protect the public health and welfare of those we serve but more
important our children by prohibiting smoking and the use of electronic smoking
devices in public places and places of employment; and
      (2)   To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and

person violating this chapter who the owner, manager, operator or employee of
an establishment regulated by this chapter is required to remove from the
premises, but the person is intoxicated or otherwise reasonably believed to be
unable to safely drive or conduct himself or herself if required to leave those
premises, in this event the owner, manager, operator or employee may reasonably
determine to allow the person violating this chapter to remain on the premises
until appropriate arrangements may be made for the person’s removal.
         (c)   In the event the person (or persons) violating this chapter is
timely removed from the premises; no violation shall exist for any owner,
manager, operator or employee related to the establishment in which these
events occurred. In no event is an owner or agent of the premises to forcibly
remove the person violating the chapter. Compliance is achieved under this
division (E)(2) if the owner or agent of the premises orders the person
violating the chapter to leave its premises and promptly notifies the police if
the person refuses.
      (3)   In the event the person (or persons) violating this chapter fails
or refuses to comply with this directive and the owner, manager, operator or
employee who observed the violation or if a different person who directed the
person (or person) in violation to leave the premises, fails to take immediate
and reasonable steps to obtain the removal of the person (or persons) from the
premises, the owner, manager, operator or employee failing to take appropriate
steps required by this chapter shall be in violation of this chapter.

be in violation of this chapter for each violation that occurs on its premises
and in connection with which the owner, manager, operator or employee fail to
take appropriate steps required by this chapter.
      (5)   An employee who observes a person (or persons) violating this
chapter may immediately notify his or her owner, manager, or supervisor of the
violation in satisfaction of the employee’s responsibility under this chapter.
The failure of the employee’s owner, manager or supervisor to take appropriate
steps required by this chapter in response to the employee’s notice shall not
constitute a violation on the part of the employee.
      (6)   In the event all duties required under this section are satisfied
yet the person violating this chapter persists in his or her violation and/or
refuses to vacate the premises on which the violation occurred, the owner,
manager, supervisor and/or employee shall immediately contact one or more of
the agencies or departments authorized above to enforce this chapter informing
the agency or department of the circumstances of the violation or notify the
police that the violator is committing a criminal trespass in the third degree
by failing to vacate the premises after being told to leave the premises.
      (7)   The mere presence of a person smoking within the premises of an
establishment governed by this chapter does not constitute a violation on the
part of the establishment. The establishment and its agents shall only be
charged for a violation of this chapter if the responsible agent(s) of the
establishment fail to timely satisfy each responsibility prescribed for them in
this section.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the city, the
county Health Department, an employee or any person aggrieved by a failure to
comply with this chapter, whether by commission or omission, including
violations on the part of an owner, operator, manager, employee or other person
(s) in control of a public place or a place of employment covered by this

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 122.01 FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF PUBLIC POLICY; PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Commission finds it has been the experience of other communities
that certain adult entertainment activities which are located near areas zoned
for residential use, near schools and public parks, and near malls and similar
open spaces that cater to use by family groups and children adversely affect
the viability of such nearby properties for their described purposes.
   (B)   The City of Pikeville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the United
States government have spent millions of dollars on community development and
neighborhood enhancement projects within the recent past to eliminate blight
and to prevent the further deterioration of Pikeville neighborhoods.
   (C)   (1)   The Commission relies on such evidence of the adverse secondary
effects of adult entertainment uses that is within the common knowledge of
municipalities and is widely reported in judicial opinions, media reports, land
use studies, and crime impact reports made available to the Commission, several
of which are set forth herein. Additionally, the Commission relies on repeated
judicial findings validating municipalities’ reasonable reliance on this body
of secondary effects evidence to support time, place, and manner regulations of
sexually oriented businesses. The Commission relies upon and incorporates the
findings of secondary effects discussed in the following non-exhaustive list of
cases: Pap’s A.M. v. City of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Los Angeles v.
Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres,

      (2)   The Commission further relies on reports concerning secondary
effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but
not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona-1979; Houston, Texas - 1997; Indianapolis,
Indiana - 1984: Amarillo, Texas - 1977; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Los
Angles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Austin, Texas - 1986:
Seattle, Washington - 1989; Tucson, Arizona - 1990; Testimony, Warner-Robins,
Georgia - 2000; Newport News, Virginia - 1996; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; New
York Times Square study - 1994; Minnesota, State of - 1989; Phoenix, Arizona -
1995-1998; and also on findings of physical abuse from the paper entitled
“Stripclubs According to Strippers - Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence,” by
Kelly Holsopple, Program Codes Enforcement Officer, Freedom and Justice Center
for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Based on cases and reports
such as these, the Commission finds:
      (a)   Sexually oriented adult entertainment businesses, as a category of
commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary
effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes,
prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency,
obscenity, illicit drug use and, drug trafficking, negative impacts on property
values, urban blight, pornographic litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (b)   Sexual acts including masturbation, oral and anal sex, sometimes
occur at unregulated adult entertainment businesses, especially those which
provide private or semi-private booths, rooms, or cubicles for viewing films,
videos, or live sexually explicit shows, which acts constitute a public
nuisance and pose a risk to public health through the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases.
      (c)   Adult entertainment businesses should be separated from sensitive
land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and
should be separated from other certain uses, such as other sexually oriented
businesses and establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages to minimize
the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent a concentration
of sexually oriented businesses and such uses.
      (d)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm, which the Commission has a substantial government interest in abating
and/or preventing in the future.
   (D)   Adult entertainment activity tends to attract an undesirable clientele
which discourages neighboring residents from undertaking civic improvements,
causes residents and businesses to move elsewhere and frustrates attempts to
attract new residences and businesses to come into an area, all of which
factors contribute to a diminution of property values and to a general
deterioration of neighborhoods.
   (E)   The small closet-like rooms or “booths” at adult amusement arcades in
other communities have encouraged persons to loiter for the purposes of
engaging in unlawful, often anonymous, sexual conduct and have encouraged lewd
conduct in public places, thereby creating public nuisances and generally
unsanitary and unhealthful conditions that create dangers to the public health,
welfare and safety.
   (F)   The concentration of sexually explicit movies and books and sexual
paraphernalia in adult entertainment establishments which also house sexually
explicit movies, as well as hotel rooms rented by the hour to “couples”
afforded free sexually explicit movies in the hotel room, have provided
prostitutes an appealing and visible meeting place to ply their trade and have
created public nuisances in otherwise respectable neighborhoods.
   (G)   Children, the family environment and residential neighborhoods suffer
injury from the deleterious effects and harmful consequences resulting from the
distribution of, and exposure to, certain sexually explicit items and devices.
This is particularly so when such items and devices are permitted to leave a
business’ premises and litter the immediate family environment, neighborhood
and certain areas where children are likely to be.
   (H)   The noise generated by patrons coming and going from adult
entertainment establishments causes a substantial disruption to nearby
residents and modest curtailment of the hours during which entertainment is
offered to patrons of such establishments would afford some relief to persons
living in those nearby residences without significantly interfering with the
availability of adult entertainment.
   (I)   Nationally, there is extensive involvement of organized crime in the
business of adult bookstores and the disclosure of persons who own, as well as
the names of those persons who operate adult bookstores and other adult
entertainment establishments will aid law enforcement officials in the
enforcement of the federal Racketeer Influences and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO) and the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, among
others, prohibiting the distribution of obscene matter, the use of minors to
distribute obscene matter, the advertising of obscene material, the
distribution of obscene material to minors, promoting the sale of obscenity,
the use of a minor in a sexual performance, the distribution of material
portraying a sexual performance by a minor, the promoting of material
portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the advertising of material
portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the use of minors to distribute
materials portraying a sexual performance by a minor.
   (J)   The Commission declares as a matter of public policy that in order to
preserve surrounding neighborhoods, to prevent blight and the deterioration of
the neighborhoods of Pikeville, protect property values, promote the return of
residents and businesses to the neighborhoods, protect children from the
deleterious effects of exposure to sexually explicit material and decrease the
incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency, the licensing and regulation of
adult entertainment establishments is a public necessity and is required in the
interest of public health, safety and welfare as well as the economic and
aesthetic well-being of the people.
   (K)   Purposes.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regular sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of Pikeville, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to
prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses
within Pikeville. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable
access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material;
      (2)   To prevent the unsanitary conditions that exist at adult amusement
arcades, and to prevent health risks, including AIDs and other sexually
transmitted diseases, caused by illicit and unlawful sexual relations in such
public establishments;
      (3)   To protect children and the family environment from the deleterious
and harmful effects of exposure to certain sexually explicit items and devices;
and
      (4)   To obtain the identity of persons licensed and to be licensed for
the operation of establishments selling, showing, renting or offering certain
sexually explicit material or entertainment to ensure proper identification of
those persons responsible for the operation of such businesses so as to assist
in the proper enforcement of this chapter.
   (L)   It is not the purpose of this chapter to establish community standards
on obscenity nor to permit persons to engage in any activity which is in
violation of law, including but not limited to, state laws pertaining to the
advertising, promotion, distribution or sale of obscene matter or matters
portraying a sexual performance by a minor, or state laws pertaining to the use
of a minor in a sexual performance or promotion of sexual performance by a
minor, or the use of a minor to distribute material portraying sexual
performance by a minor.

§ 122.43 SCIENTER NECESSARY TO PROVE LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not impose strict liability for violations of its
provisions. Where any provision or offense herein fails to state a necessary
level of culpability to establish a violation or liability, the offence shall
be established upon a showing, that the person acted knowingly or recklessly
with regard to the predicate act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for
the purposes of this chapter, an act by an employee shall be imputed to the
adult entertainment licensee for the purpose of establishing a violation of
this chapter, or for purposes of license denial, modification, or revocation
only if a licensee allowed, either knowingly or by reckless failure to
supervise, a violation of this chapter to occur. It shall be a defense to
liability that the adult entertainment establishment licensee was powerless to
prevent the violation.

alterations, or improvements to a structure, building, or real property without
obtaining a job permit. The fee for a job permit shall be the minimum license
tax provided for in §
115.14 , with a minimum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). The applicant shall
submit a signed application in full describing the work to be performed, the

Code, the schedule of building/job permit fees shall be double the amount set
forth in divisions (H) and (I) above and in no case less than one hundred

because of the nature of the type of construction to be done in connection with
all building permits that damage may occur to any public sidewalk, street or
roadway, the Inspector shall defer issuing a building permit until such time as
the City Engineer has been given an opportunity to review the plans and
specifications for construction. In the event that the City Engineer determines
that because of the nature or extent of the construction to be undertaken by
the applicant, that damage may result in any public sidewalk, street or roadway
because of the construction undertaken or which may result from vehicles or
materials accessing the building site of such a weight so as to cause damage to
a public roadway or sidewalk, the City Engineer shall immediately advise the
Building Inspector of this fact and shall estimate in a dollar amount the
potential damages that may occur to public sidewalks, streets or roadways. Upon
receipt by the Building Inspector of such notification, the Building Inspector
shall not issue a building permit until such time as the applicant shall file
with the city a bond in the amount set forth by the City Engineer, with surety
to be approved by the Inspector. Said bond shall be conditioned to indemnify
the city for any loss or damage resulting from the work undertaken or the
manner in doing the same to public sidewalks, streets or roadways. The bond
shall further be conditioned that the city will be paid by the surety thereupon
in the event that the principal fails to pay. Any damage to public sidewalks,
streets or roadways shall be restored by the applicant under the direction and
satisfaction of the Building Inspector and Codes Enforcement Officer. Upon
failure or refusal of the applicant to restore the same, the city may proceed
without notice to make restoration and shall forfeit the bond required to be
posted herein. In no case shall the bond be determined to be the limit on the
amount of damages which can be sought against the applicant. In the event that
the cost of restoration performed by the city should exceed the amount of the
bond, the city shall proceed to collect the remainder due from the applicant.

§ 151.01 INTRODUCTION/ PURPOSE.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches
and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during
construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
   (B)   As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard
persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the city.
This chapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and
controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development
or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the
movement of earth on land in the city. It is intended to supplement the
requirements of the Subdivision Regulations and Zoning Ordinance for the city.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky has in Kentucky Revised Statutes delegated to local government units
the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Pikeville,
Kentucky, hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance, as set
forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of Pikeville are subject to periodic
inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by
the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity:
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction:
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters:
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
      (7)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.

chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principal structure, and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare. This includes areas downstream from dams.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe

FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to
as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by a community.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing

      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      (3)   Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to
a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas,
as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of
the current.
      (4)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and the
regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the

administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, the FEMA form in effect at the time of certification
stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation with walls
that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all structural
components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces,
including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.
Also referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in § 152.23, Appeals and variance
procedures, the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of
the public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that
every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years.
Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation
are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods,
while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to
all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood
damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property,
unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only
at very high flood insurance rates.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). 
      (1)   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE coverage means under the standard
flood insurance policy the cost to repair a substantially flood damaged
building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a
substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage
prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are floodproofing (non-
residential). relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination thereof.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs include the following
categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA
amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION - FILL (LOMR-F). A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   LEVEE. A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, attached
garage, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure
and after the completion of construction.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure’s lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required utilities. The
term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable
structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or
longer and intended to be improved property. The term MANUFACTURED HOME does
not include a recreational vehicle (see “recreational vehicle”).

land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP. The flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) or the flood insurance rate map
(FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four (4) digit number on a flood map, followed by a
letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four (4) digits represent the map
panel. The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA; the letter “B” is the first
revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and
seller), excluding the value of the land as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. MARKET VALUE of the structure can be established by
independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of
structure (actual cash value) or adjusted assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL). The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on a community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of
disaster response and recovery.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW). A condition where there is a river, flow, or
inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e. MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA. An area with land surfaces and slopes of
unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRMs. Refer to
FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by
a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   NON-RESIDENTIAL. Structures that are not designed for human habitation,
including but not limited to: small business concerns, churches, schools, farm
structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses,
recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial
structures, warehouses, and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less
than six (6) months duration.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD). As corrected in 1988, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRMs and digitally referenced FIRMs
(DFIRMs). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM panel legend for correct datum.)
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD). See “base flood.” The flood that
has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the 100-
year flood. Over the life of a thirty (30) year loan, there is a twenty-six
percent (26%) chance of experiencing such a flood with the SFHA.
   PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY. A community that voluntarily elects to participate
in the NFlP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that
are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.
   PRE-FIRM CONSTRUCTION. New construction or substantial improvements for
which the start of construction occurred on or before December 31, 1974, or
before the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is
later.
   POST-FIRM CONSTRUCTION. New construction or substantial improvements for
which start of construction occurred after December 31, 1974, or on or after
the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later.

duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULAR PROGRAM. The phase of a community’s participation in the NFIP where
more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher
amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in the FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1)
foot. See “base flood.”
   REMEDY A VIOLATION. The process by which a community brings a structure or
other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management
regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impact of non-
compliance. Reduced impact may include protecting the structure or other
affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement
provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or

other development.
   REPAIR. The reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing structure.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on average, equals or exceeds twenty-five
percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   REPETITIVE LOSS PROPERTY. Any insurable building for which two (2) or more
claims of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) were paid by the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within any rolling ten (10) year period, since
1978. At least two (2) of the claims must be more than ten (10) days apart but
within ten (10) years of each other. A RL property may or may not be currently

§ 152.21 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
152.04. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of the Floodplain
Administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required:
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§
152.31(B) and
152.33(B);
      (4)    Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood-proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, the
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood-
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make the corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-
work order for the project.

federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;
      (3)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner;
      (4)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, ADVERSELY
AFFECTS means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (B)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood elevation
data has not been provided in accordance with §
152.04, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer §§
152.30 through
152.36. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Commission for
adoption.
   (C)   Notification of other agencies.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division of Water, and
any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse; and
      (2)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA); and
      (3)    Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse is maintained.
   (D)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
      (1)   Certification required by §
152.31(A) (lowest floor elevations) as shown on a completed and certified
elevation certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to
mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and
substantially improved structures, in accordance with §
152.21(B);
      (2)   Certification required by §
152.31(B) (elevation or floodproofing of non-residential structures) as shown
on a completed and certified FEMA floodproofing certificate. Verify and record
the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new and
substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed, in accordance with §
152.21(B);
      (3)   Certification required by §
152.31(C) (elevated structures);
      (4)   Certification of elevation required by §

   (E)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions.
      (1)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
152.23(C)(1);
      (2)   When base flood elevation data and floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
152.04, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonable
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
152.30 through
152.36;
      (3)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
152.31(B) a flood-proofing certificate;
      (4)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall be
maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be open for
public inspection.
   (F)   Right of entry.
      (1)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the Floodplain Administrator has
reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any
premises any condition or ordinance violation which makes such building,
structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Floodplain
Administrator may enter such building, structure or premises at all reasonable
times to inspect the same or perform any duty imposed upon the Floodplain
Administrator by this chapter.
      (2)   If such structure or premises are occupied, the Floodplain
Administrator shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such
building, structure, or premises are unoccupied, he or she shall first make a
reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control
of such request entry.
      (3)   If entry is refused, the Floodplain Administrator shall have
recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
      (4)   When the Floodplain Administrator shall have first obtained a
proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no
owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any
building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is
made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the Floodplain
Administrator for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this
chapter.
   (G)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator, work
on any building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the
provisions of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in
writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her
agent, or to the person performing the work, and shall state the conditions
under which work may be resumed.
   (H)   Revocation of permits.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit upon determination
that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition,
installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit was issued
is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of this chapter.
   (I)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the Floodplain
Administrator’s staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties, shall
not thereby render personally liable, and is hereby relieved from all personal
liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of
any act required or permitted in the discharge of his or her duties. Any suit
brought against any officer, employee, or member because of such act performed
by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this chapter shall be
defended by the Department of Law until the final termination of the
proceedings.

§ 152.23 APPEALS; VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City of Pikeville government to help protect
its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of
the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that
variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain
multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted.
The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The Pikeville City
Commission shall establish a Variance and Appeal Board consisting of Property
Review Board.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Variance and Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Variance and Appeal
Board may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky
Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Variance
and Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
existing or proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent use;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Variance and Appeal Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Commission need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Commission
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
152.02 under “public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in §
152.02) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
      (5)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of division (D) of this
section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Pikeville City Clerk and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and
report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition in §
152.02) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.

152.99
§ 152.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
152.04, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall
be provided in accordance with the standards of division (C) of this section.
      (1)   In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified
in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest
adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than one (1)foot
above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative
Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the
technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: “The applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby base
flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than± five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross
sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the Cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations.”
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community Building Inspection
Department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed to an elevation one (1) foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such certification along with
the design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) of this
section.
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an
elevation one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this
requirement must meet or exceed the standards of division (C) of this section.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above
foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than
the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed
on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s flood
insurance rate map (FIRM)
must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and
anchoring. Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels;
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of
a flood.
         (b)   All such manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1) foot
above the level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)    (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes.
         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
152.04 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If this division (F) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
152.30 through

properties. Interchange of traffic between expressways and other streets (only
arterial streets when possible) is accomplished by grade separated interchange
with merging deceleration and acceleration lanes.
      (2)   ARTERIALS. Arterial streets rank second in the classification of
streets, with possible access to abutting properties and are used primarily for
vehicular movement. Access to abutting properties, if permitted, should be
provided by means of a marginal access street in order to serve several
abutting properties rather than provide each abutting property its own
individual access thereto. Arterial streets are the link between expressways
and collector streets, and generally rank next to expressways in traffic
volume, speed limit control, and right-of-way limits.
      (3)   COLLECTOR STREETS. Collector streets rank third in the
classification of streets, and they are principally used for vehicular
movement; however, access to abutting properties is planned and controlled so
that minimum disturbance is made to the traffic flow on the collector street.
Collectors are the link between arterial and minor streets and generally rank
next to minor streets in right-of-way widths and speed control.
      (4)   MINOR STREETS. Minor streets rank fourth in the classification of
streets and are used primarily for providing access to abutting properties.
Vehicular movement on minor streets should have an origin or destination in the
immediate vicinity, whereas all types of through traffic should be eliminated.
Minor streets are primarily links between generator points (homes, offices,
stores, and the like) and collector streets.  MINOR STREETS may be further
classified into five (5) categories as follows:
         (a)   ALLEYS. Streets generally having two (2) open ends with each end
connecting to different streets. Such streets generally provide service and
access to the rear of abutting properties on both sides.
         (b)   CONTINUING STREETS. Minor streets having two (2) open ends; each
end generally connects with a different street. One (1) or more streets may
intersect such a street between its two (2) open ends, and property abuts both
sides of such a street.
         (c)   CUL-DE-SACS. Minor streets having only one (1) open end and
providing access to another street, and a closed end providing a turnaround
circle for vehicular movement. No street of this type shall dead end at the
closed end, unless future plans provide for continuation of the street, or
unless topography prohibits continuation. Turnaround circles of a radius of not
less than fifty (50) feet shall be required where deemed necessary by the
Planning Commission.
         (d)   LOOP STREETS. Minor streets having two (2) open ends, each
generally connecting with the same street. No other streets intersect between
the two (2) ends, and property abuts both sides thereof.
         (e)   MARGINAL ACCESS STREETS. Minor streets generally having two (2)
or more access points to the major street system by connecting to a street of
higher classification. Property abuts only one (1) side of such a street,
whereas the other side thereof should generally be parallel and adjacent to a
street of higher classification. MARGINAL ACCESS STREETS are sometimes called
access or frontage roads.

Administrative Official except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter, unless he receives a written order from the Board of Zoning Adjustment
in the form of an administrative review, conditional use permit, or variance as
provided by this chapter. Regardless of the provisions of the Kentucky Building

of the criteria described below will in all cases require a building permit:
      (1)   Any repair, modification, construction or reconstruction of a
building or structure which results in an addition to the enclosed portion of a
building or structure which extends outside its existing footprint. This would
include, but not be limited to, extending or modification of rootline, the
enclosure of carports, decks, porches, or similar external structures.
      (2)   Any modification or construction which will result in a change in
use of the building or structure. For example, the conversion of a single-
family dwelling into a multi-family dwelling, conversion of a commercial use to
a residential use or residential use to a commercial use.
      (3)   Any modification or construction to a building or structure which
is contracted for a sum of more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or which
requires the purchase or use of materials having a fair retail value or actual
cost in this amount regardless of whether the owner is being charged for labor.
      (4)   Any new utility or utility service established as part of any
repair, modification, construction or reconstruction of a building or
structure.
   (B)   If no building permit has been issued and a builder begins or
continues to build, a restraining order may be obtained upon application to the
proper court of record and evidence of the lack of a building permit shall
establish a prima facie case for the issuance of the restraining order.
   (C)   All applications for building permits shall be subject to the
following requirements to ensure proper setbacks, lot area and yard
requirements, etc.:
      (1)   They shall be accompanied by plans in duplicate, consisting of a
plat or site plan which is drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions and
shape of the lot to be built upon, the exact size and location of the buildings
already existing, if any, and the locations and dimensions of the proposed
building or alteration, and a parking plan demonstrating compliance with §
156.130.
      (2)   In the event the building permit application proposes modifications
to a building or structure on a nonconforming lot, with a nonconforming use, or
which is a nonconforming feature, as defined in §
156.052, the plans required above shall be required to be certified by either a
professional engineer or a surveyor licensed to practice in Kentucky.
      (3)   In the event the building permit application proposes to build
within the same “footprint” of a structure which has been demolished within the
previous two (2) years and which will have a different use from that of the
demolished building, the plans required above shall be required to be certified
by either a professional engineer or a surveyor licensed to practice in
Kentucky.
      (4)   The application shall include such other information as lawfully
may be required by the administrative official, including existing or proposed
building or alteration; existing or proposed uses of the building or the land,
the number of families, housekeeping or rental units the building is designed
to accommodate; conditions existing on the lot; and such matters as may be
necessary to determine conformance with and provide for the enforcement of this
chapter and Section 113 of the State Building Code.
   (D)   One copy of the plans shall be returned to the applicant by the
Administrative Official after he shall have marked such copy either approved or
disapproved and attested to same by his signature on such copy. The second copy
of the plans, similarly marked, shall be retained by the Administrative
Official.
   (E)   If the work described in any building permit has not begun within one
(1) year, twelve (12) months from the date of issuance thereof, the permit
shall expire; it shall be revoked by the Administrative Official; and written
notice thereof shall be given to the persons affected, together with notice
that further work as described in the cancelled permit shall not proceed unless
and until a new building permit has been obtained.

applications and all certificates issued.
   (D)   If the newly erected or altered structure and the new use of the
premises conform with all applicable ordinances, regulations, and codes, the

authorizing the use thereof. If the structure or use fails to conform, the
Administrative Official shall refuse to issue a certificate of zoning
compliance and shall deliver written notice to the applicant stating the
reasons for refusal.
   (E)   Inspections. The Administrative Official shall inspect the newly
constructed or altered structure or the premises for which a changed use is
proposed and shall issue or refuse to issue a certificate of zoning compliance
thirty (30) days after the date on which the new use is ready to commence and
where the thirty (30) day notice period expires on or before the date shown in
the application for the new use to commence, without the inspection by the
Administrative Official above provided for, the new use shall be deemed to have
been approved without a certificate of occupancy.

Administrative Official shall not waive any provision or regulation of this
chapter.

   (A)   A Board of Zoning Adjustment is hereby established in accordance with
KRS 100.217. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consist of five (5) citizen
members, not more than two (2) of whom may be members of the Planning
Commission. The initial terms of the membership shall be as follows: one (1)
member for a two (2) year term; two (2) members for a three (3) year term; and
two (2) members for a four (4) year term. Subsequent appointments shall be for
a term of four (4) years. They shall be appointed by the Mayor, with the
approval of the Board of Commissioners. Vacancies on the Board of Zoning
Adjustment shall be filled within sixty (60) days by the appropriate appointing
authority. If the authority shall fail to act within that time, the Planning
Commission shall fill that vacancy. When a vacancy occurs other than through
expiration of the term of office, it shall be filled for the remainder of that
term.
   (B)   The Chairperson, or in his or her absence the acting chairperson, may
administer oaths and the Board of Zoning Adjustment may compel the attendance
of witnesses. All meetings of the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be open to
the public. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall keep minutes of its
proceedings.
   (C)   Three (3) members of the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall constitute a
quorum. The Board shall act by resolution, and the concurring vote of three (3)
members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement,
decision, or determination of the Building Official or any other duly
authorized administrative officer, or to decide in favor of an applicant in any
matter on which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to grant any
variance from the requirements stipulated in this chapter. The grounds of every
such determination shall be stated. A member of the Board shall not be
qualified to vote if he or she has not attended the public hearing or if he or
she has a direct interest in the issue appealed.
(Ord. passed 1-27-87; Am. Ord. 07-0-002, passed 2-26-07)
§ 156.031 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:
   (A)   Administrative review. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall hear and
decide appeals where it is alleged by an applicant that there is error in any
order, requirement, permit, decision, determination, or refusal made by the
Building Inspector or other administrative official in the carrying out or
enforcement of any provision in this chapter and the interpretation of the
zoning map. The concurring vote of three (3) members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse or modify any order or decision of the Administrative
Official.
   (B)   Bylaws. The Board shall adopt bylaws for its own government subject to
approval of the Board of Commissioners.
   (C)   Conditional uses. The Board shall have the power to hear and decide
applications for conditional use permits to allow the proper integration into
the community of uses which are specifically named in the zoning regulations
which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone, only if certain
conditions are met.
   (D)   Variances. The Board shall have the power to hear and decide on
applications for off-street parking and loading variances as provided in §
156.130(B)(1) and for dimensional variance where by reason of the exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of the site on the effective date of
the zoning code or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or some
other extraordinary situation or condition of that site, the literal
enforcement of the dimensional requirements (height or width of buildings, size
of yards, but not population densities) of the zoning regulations would deprive
the applicant of the reasonable capacity to make use of the land in a manner
equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone. The Board
may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions on any variance it decides
to grant.
      (1)   Before any variance is granted, the Board of Zoning Adjustment must
find all of the following, which shall be recorded along with any imposed
conditions or restrictions in its minutes and records and issued in written
form to the applicant to constitute proof of the dimensional variance:
         (a)   The specific conditions in detail which are unique to the
applicant’s land and do not exist on other land in the same zone;
         (b)   The manner in which the strict application of the provisions of
the regulations would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land
in the manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same
zone;
         (c)   Reasons that the variance will preserve, not harm, the public
safety and welfare, and will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood;
         (d)   Proof that the unique conditions and circumstances are not the
result of actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the
zoning code.
      (2)   Limits of authority. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall not
possess the power to grant a variance, to permit a use of any land, building,
or structure which is not permitted by the zoning regulations in the zone in
question or to alter density requirements in the zone in question. The Board of
Zoning Adjustment does not possess the power to permit a use not authorized by
this chapter.
      (3)   Application of variance. A dimensional variance applies to the
property for which it is granted and not to the applicant. A variance also runs
with the land, but it cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different
site.
      (4)   Additional powers. In granting a variance, the Board of Zoning
Adjustment may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location,
character, and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it
may deem advisable to the furtherance of the purpose of this chapter.
      (5)   Limitations. Before any variance is granted, the Board of Zoning
Adjustment must find present conditions which must be sustained by evidence
presented by the applicant that the property will not yield a reasonable return
if used in compliance with this chapter; that the conditions causing the
hardship are unique and are not shared by neighboring property in the same
zone; that the granting of the variance will not be in conflict with the zoning
code. These conditions must be alleged by the applicant and evidence must be
produced by him or her to substantiate those allegations.
      (6)   Parking. Where there is no clear standard for off-street parking,
the Board shall determine adequacy.

   (B)   Appeals. An appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be taken by
any person aggrieved or affected by any decision of the Administrative
Official. Such appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days after the date of
the decision and is taken by filing with the Administrative Official a notice
of appeal specifying the grounds thereof together with the filing fee required
by the Board. The Administrative Official shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was
taken.
   (C)   Hearings. If any application or appeal is received at least five (5)
working days before a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Zoning
Adjustment, it shall act within forty-five (45) days after such meeting.

an decision on an application or appeal, the Board shall hold a public hearing
at such times as shall be determined by the Board itself. Special hearings can
be arranged at the call of the Chairperson. Notices of the time and place of
hearings shall be mailed to applicants and be published for one (1) week prior
thereto in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. Each application or
appeal shall be accompanied by a check payable to the City Treasurer or a cash
payment in the following amounts as specified in §
156.016. If additional costs are incurred, the applicant shall pay upon receipt
of a statement from the appropriate city official.

neighborhood, or the community.
(Ord. passed 1-27-87)
§ 156.048 CONVERSION OF DWELLINGS.

respect to minimum lot size, lot area per dwelling unit, percentage of lot
coverage, dimension of yards and other open spaces, and off-street parking.
(Ord. passed 1-27-87) Penalty, see §

(Ord. passed 1-27-87)
§ 156.050 CONDITIONAL USES.
   Conditional uses may be permitted in districts as designated under this
zoning code but only when specifically approved by the Board of Zoning
Adjustment. All conditional uses shall be subject to the following regulations
unless otherwise stated in this chapter.
   (A)   Conditional approval in all districts. The following conditional uses
only may be approved in all zoning districts:
      (1)   Local public utilities and private transmission lines and pipes;
      (2)   Radio, television, or telephone transmission towers;
      (3)   Large utility structures and public service buildings;
      (4)   Expansion of railroads and appurtenances;
      (5)   Agricultural uses which are preferred (and conditional) uses in all
districts where use existing at time of adoption of this chapter is
agricultural;
      (6)   Mining which is subject to approval by the Kentucky Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet pursuant to KRS Chapters 350 and
351, as amended.
      (7)   Other conditional uses may be approved in only those zoning
districts where they are designated as conditional uses under the zoning
district regulations of this chapter.
   (B)   In applying for a conditional use permit, the applicant shall submit
an application to the Administrative Official and shall follow all procedures
set forth in this chapter, regarding the procedure for building permit
application. The Administrative Official shall then refer the application to
the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The Board shall charge a fee, as provided in §
156.016, for reviewing all conditional use permit applications, and shall
notify all adjacent property owners by certified mail of the time and place of
the meeting at which such review will occur. The applicant shall pay costs of
notification upon receipt of a statement from the appropriate city official.
   (C)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment may approve, modify, or deny any
application for a conditional use permit. If it approves the permit, it may
attach necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one (1)
or more things be done before the request can be initiated or conditions of a
continuing nature that there shall be no departure from this zoning code. The
Board of Zoning Adjustment shall especially consider the effect of the
conditional use on surrounding uses in determining whether a conditional use
should be approved, modified, or disapproved. In such conditions, it shall be
recorded in the Board’s minutes and on the conditional use permit along with
reference to the specific section of the zoning code listing the conditional
use under consideration. If the conditional use application is approved by the
Board of Zoning Adjustment it shall issue written authorization to the
Administrative Official to issue a conditional mining permit, building permit,
or certificate of occupancy in conformance with this chapter. This written
authorization by the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall include a statement of
the factual determination by the Board of Zoning Adjustment which justifies the
issuance of the permit and a statement of the specific conditions which must be
met in order for the use to be permitted. Granting of a conditional use permit
does not exempt the applicant from complying with all of the requirements of
building, housing, and other regulations.
   (D)   No request for a conditional use permit for mining shall be considered
until the owner, operator, or lessee of each mine shall submit to the Board of
Zoning Adjustment a copy of the Preliminary Mining Application Document as
submitted to the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection
Cabinet (KNREP). The Board of Zoning Adjustment may issue an Interim
Conditional Use Permit for Mining, after all other requirements of this chapter
have been met, contingent upon the permittee receiving a permit from KNREP to
operate such a mine. Such final conditional use permit shall be applicable to
the specific property and transferred with the property if the property is
sold.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment will not issue a final conditional
use permit for mining until the permittee presents the state mining permit as
issued by KNREP.
      (2)   As a stipulation of a conditional use permit for mining within the
city limits, the owner, operator, or lessee of each mine shall be required to
meet and comply with all requirements and regulations of the Kentucky
Department of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Kentucky Department
of Mines and Minerals, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, and
the Federal Office of Surface Mining.
   (E)   All conditional use permits and accompanying final plats approved by
the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be recorded at the expense of the
applicant in the office of the County Court Clerk, as provided by KRS 100.329.
      (1)   The Administrative Official shall not issue any building permits or
certificates of occupancy for any conditional use permit or accompanying final
plats until the conditional use permit and final plat, if any, have been
properly recorded by the applicant.
      (2)   An approved and recorded conditional use permit shall limit and
control the issuance of all building permits and shall restrict the
construction, location, use, and operation of all land and structures to all
conditions set forth in the conditional use permit and accompanying final plat;
provided, however, that upon application to and approval by the Board of Zoning
Adjustment, minor changes in the location of structures and other minor
details, may be permitted. No change shall be authorized which violates the
spirit and intent of the originally approved conditional use permit of the
provisions of this chapter. A conditional use permit applies to the property
for which it is granted and not to the individual who applied for it. A
conditional use permit and accompanying final plat also run with the land and
is transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be transferred
by the applicant to a different site.
   (F)   The Administrative Official shall review all conditional use permits,
except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least
once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where
the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the owner is
complying with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use permit. A
written report of the annual review shall be submitted to the Mayor and
Council. If the owner is not complying with all the conditions listed on the
conditional use permit, the Administrative Official shall report the fact in
writing to the Chairman of the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The report shall
state specifically the manner in which the owner is not complying with the
conditions on the conditional use permit, and a copy of the report shall be
furnished to the Chairman of the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The Board of
Zoning Adjustment shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time,
and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the owner
at least one (1) week prior to the meeting. If the Board of Zoning Adjustment
finds that the facts alleged in the report of the Administrative Official are
true and that the owner has taken no steps to comply with them between the date
of the report and the date of the hearing, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall
have the power to authorize the Administrative Official to revoke the
conditional use permit authorized. Furthermore, the Board of Zoning Adjustment
shall have a right of action to compel offending structures or uses removed at
the cost of the violator and may have judgment in personam for such cost.
   (G)   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within the time limit set by the Board of Zoning Adjustment or within one (1)
year, if no specific time has been set, the conditional use permit shall revert
to its original designation. EXERCISED , as set forth herein, shall mean that
binding contracts for the construction of the main building, buildings, or
other improvements have been awarded, or in the absence of contracts that the
main building, buildings, or other improvements are under construction to a
substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial
investment shall be under contract, in development, or completed. When
construction is not a part of the use, EXERCISED shall mean that the use is in
operation in compliance as set forth in the permit. In respect to conditional
use permits for mining, EXERCISED shall be satisfied by presentation of the
KNREP mining permit to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
   (H)   Once the Board of Zoning Adjustment has completed a conditional use
permit and all the conditions required are of such type that can be completely
and permanently satisfied, the Administrative Official, upon request of the
applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions
have been satisfied and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions have
been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of the conditional
use permit which is on file with the County Court Clerk. Thereafter, the use,
if it continues to meet the other requirements of the regulations, will be
treated as a permitted use.

156.999
§ 156.052 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   It is the intent of this chapter to recognize that the eventual
elimination, as expeditiously as is reasonable, of existing uses or structures
that are not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter is as much a
subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prevention of the
establishment of new uses or structures that would violate the provisions of
this chapter. It is also the intent of this chapter that any elimination of
nonconformities shall be affected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of
established private property rights.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots.
      (1)   Definition. A NONCONFORMING LOT is a lot that was lawfully created
prior to the effective date of this chapter or a subsequent amendment thereto,
but does not conform to the minimum gross land area or minimum lot width
requirements established in this chapter for the zoning district in which it is
located.
      (2)   Required combination or recombination of nonconforming lots.
         (a)   Where a nonconforming lot abuts another lot of record, whether
conforming or nonconforming, held in the same ownership at or subsequent to
enactment of this chapter, such lots shall be combined or recombined as
necessary to form a conforming lot or lots and shall not thereafter be
subdivided except in compliance with all of the requirements of this chapter.
         (b)   Where a nonconforming lot was created by public taking action or
as a result of a court order, the above combination or recombination of lots
shall not be required.
      (3)   Use of nonconforming lots. Where a nonconforming lot cannot be
combined or recombined with other lots to form a conforming lot or lots, such
nonconforming lot may be used subject to the compliance of the intended use and
structure with applicable use regulations and with applicable setback and
height regulations. However, any use (such as two-family or multi-family
dwelling) that requires a greater gross land area than the minimum gross land
area listed in this chapter for the appropriate zoning district shall not be
permitted on a lot which does not conform to such minimum gross land area
requirement. If compliance of the structure intended on the nonconforming lot
with applicable setback regulations is not reasonably possible, the
nonconforming lot may be used as a building site subject to the granting of a
variance from such setback regulations by the Board of Zoning Adjustment in
accord with the provisions §§
156.030 through
156.033.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses.
      (1)   Definition. A NONCONFORMING USE is a use of land, buildings, or
structures that was lawfully established prior to the effective date of this
chapter, or a subsequent amendment thereto, but does not conform to the use
regulations of this chapter for the zoning district in which it is located.
      (2)   Regulations. Nonconforming uses may be continued subject to the
following limitations:
         (a)   A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged,
or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land, buildings, or
structures than was occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming,
provided that a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time
it became nonconforming.
         (b)   No building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be
enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless that
building or structure is thereafter devoted to a conforming use.
         (c)   When a building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use is
damaged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its current assessed
taxable value, such building, if restored, shall thereafter be devoted to
conforming uses.
         (d)   If a nonconforming use ceases for more than a twelve (12) month
period, subsequent use of the land, or structures previously devoted to such
use shall thereafter be devoted to conforming uses.
      (3)   Discontinuance.
         (a)   Any nonconforming use of land and any nonconforming use
involving structures with a total replacement cost of less than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00) at the time such use became nonconforming shall cease with
five (5) years after the date of the notice of nonconformity required in
division (F) of this section.
         (b)   Any nonconforming use involving structures with a total
replacement cost of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more at the time such
use became nonconforming shall cease with fifteen (15) years after the date of
the notice of nonconformity required in division (F) of this section, or within
forty (40) years after the construction of such structures, whichever is later.
   (D)   Nonconforming features.
      (1)   Definition. A NONCONFORMING FEATURE is a physical feature or
characteristic of a use, building, structure, or other development of land that
was lawfully established prior to the effective date of this section or a
subsequent amendment thereto, but does not conform to the regulations of the
performance standards of this chapter applicable to such use, building,
structure, or development of land, including but not limited to, nonconforming
structures, nonconforming signs, nonconforming parking facilities and
nonconforming lighting.
      (2)   Regulations. Nonconforming features may be continued subject to the
following limitations:
         (a)   No enlargement, extension, or structural alteration of any
building, structure, or other development of land having a nonconforming
feature shall increase the degree or extent of the nonconforming feature.
         (b)   When a building, structure, or other development of land having
a nonconforming feature is damaged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more
of its assessed taxable value, such building, structure, or development of land
may be reconstructed only if the nonconforming feature is eliminated and the
building or structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this
section.
      (3)   Discontinuance.
         (a)   Any sign having a nonconforming feature shall be either
eliminated, or made to conform with the provisions of this section within
twelve (12) months after the date of the notice of nonconformity required in
division (F).
         (b)   Any building, structurally independent or free-standing
structure other than a sign, or other development of land (lighting, fencing,
parking area, or accessory structure) having a nonconforming feature and having
a replacement or correction cost of less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00)
shall be either eliminated or made to conform with the provisions of this
section within five (5) years after the date of the notice of nonconformity
required in division (F).
   (E)   Repairs and maintenance. Minor repairs to and routing maintenance of
land, buildings, structures, or other development of land, or portion thereof,
devoted to a nonconforming use or having nonconforming features are permitted,
provided the cost of such repairs and maintenance within any twelve (12)-month
period does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the current assessed taxable value
of the land, buildings, structure, or other development of land, or portion
thereof.
      (1)   Any structure or other development of land, or portion thereof,
devoted to a nonconforming use or having a nonconforming feature, that is
declared unsafe by the Building Inspector because of lack of repairs and
maintenance shall not be restored, repaired, reconstructed, or used except in
conformity with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Any structure or other development of land, or portion thereof,
devoted to a nonconforming use or having a nonconforming feature, that is
declared unsafe by the Building Inspector, but not because of lack of repairs
and maintenance, may be repaired and restored subject to the requirements of
divisions (C) (2) and (D) (2) of this section.
   (F)   Nonconformity survey and notice. Within eighteen (18) months after the
effective date of this chapter, or subsequent amendment thereto, the Codes and
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall make an inventory of all nonconforming uses,
signs having nonconforming features, and other significant nonconforming
features existing within the city jurisdiction. On completion of the inventory,
the Codes and Zoning Enforcement Officer shall notify the owner of the property
on which each nonconformity is located of the determination of nonconformity,
and reasons therefor, and the deadlines, where applicable, for compliance with
the provision of this chapter. This requirement shall not preclude the further
inventory and subsequent notices of nonconformity.
   (G)   Applications for permit to repair or re-establish nonconforming use.
      (1)   In any of the above cases where the owner of the property on which
the nonconforming use exists desires to obtain a permit for re-establishment or
repair of the nonconforming use, application for that permit shall be made
within six (6) months of damage to structure, discontinued use, or declaration
of unsafe status to the Administrative Official with payment of the appropriate
fee.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider such applications
within sixty (60) days of receipt, and, if the Board reasonably concludes that
strict application of the nonconforming use provisions of this chapter
practically destroys or greatly decreases the value of specific pieces of
property and adjacent property, it may set conditions for re-establishment or
repair of the nonconforming use which promote substantial justice for all
persons concerned. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to,
presentation of a security bond acceptable to the City Attorney. A unanimous
vote of the entire Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be required for approval.
   (H)   Appeal. Appeal of the decision may be made as provided in KRS Chapter

nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at the time the
regulation which makes its use nonconforming is adopted;
      (2)   The Board shall not permit a change from one nonconforming use to
another unless the new nonconforming use is in the same or a more restrictive
classification;
      (3)   In addition, the Board shall not permit replacement or repair of

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
§ 156.070 WHERE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PERMITTED.
   A planned unit development project, which may depart from conformance with
the regulations for principal building and single lot development may be
permitted in those districts where it is designated as a conditional use under
the zoning district regulations or may be permitted in any district after an
amendment to the zoning map. All Planned Unit Development (PUD) projects shall
be subject to the regulations of this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 1-27-87)
§ 156.071 PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL.
   The procedure for review and approval of all planned unit development
projects shall be as follows:
   (A)   The developer of a planned PUD project shall meet with the Planning
Commission period to the preparation or submission of a preliminary plat of a
proposed planned development project. The purpose of this meeting shall be to
discuss informally with the Planning Commission the minimum requirements and
performance standards for PUD projects as well as to discuss existing or
proposed development which may affect or be affected by the proposed
development. For the purpose of this discussion, the developer shall provide a
sketch plan indicating the proposed project area, its relationship to the
surrounding area, and the general development schedule. The advisory meeting
and informal review is designed to prevent unnecessary and costly revisions in
the design and development plan to be presented in the preliminary plat
application. Formal application or filing of a plat is not required for this
advisory meeting.
   (B)   After the advisory meeting, the developer of a proposed planned unit
development project shall submit an application for a conditional use permit or
zoning amendment, as applicable, to the Planning Commission along with a
preliminary plat of the proposed PUD project. The preliminary plat shall
reflect the standards of design set forth in this chapter for planned unit
development projects and shall provide at least the following information.
      (1)   The preliminary plat shall be drawn to scale appropriate to the
size and nature of the project and shall show the proposed dimensions, size,
location, and arrangement of the following:
         (a)   Buildings.
         (b)   Parking areas with arrangement and number of parking spaces.
(For the CBD (C-3), if parking is not available on-site, a statement assuring
compliance with §
156.130(D)(1)(b) or §
156.130(D)(1)(d).
         (c)   Entrance and exist roads and their relationship to existing and
proposed streets, alleys, and other public ways.
         (d)   Setback lines, permanent open spaces separation strips, and
landscaped areas.
         (e)   The name of the planned unit development project.
         (f)   Date, approximate north arrow, and graphic scale.
         (g)   Acreage of land within the project.
         (h)   Names and addresses of the owner, contractor, architect,
engineer or surveyor, and all owners of adjacent properties.
         (i)   Boundary lines of the project and their bearings and distances.
         (j)   Existing and proposed easements and their locations, widths, and
distances.
         (k)   Streets on and adjacent to the project and their names and

      (3)   The Planning Commission may also require that the developer provide
additional supporting data such as economic justification, financing, and
construction scheduling when deemed necessary for project review.
   (C)   Planning Commission’s review of the preliminary plat. The Planning
Commission shall review the preliminary plat in regard to its design and
compatibility with surrounding uses, major streets, the regulations of the
planned unit development provisions, and the performance standards of this
chapter. Since a planned unit development project is inherently more complex
than individual lot development and because each project must be tailored to
the topography and neighboring uses, the conditions for the project cannot be
inflexible. The Planning Commission may require revised or additional plats,
data, drawings, or profiles of the proposed project when necessary to insure
that there will be no departure from the intent of this zoning code.
   (D)   Public hearing and recommendation. After complete review of the
proposed project, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing after
notice as required as KRS Chapter 424 and make its recommendation to the Board
of Zoning Adjustment if the project is being proposed as a conditional use and
to the Board of Commissioners if the project is being proposed as a zoning
amendment. Such recommendation shall include a statement of the Planning
Commission’s determination and a statement of any special conditions which may
have been attached by the Planning Commission.
   (E)   Action by the Board of Zoning Adjustment or Board of Commissioners on
preliminary plat. Upon receipt of the proposed PUD project preliminary plat and
Planning Commission’s recommendation, the Board of Commissioners or Board of
Zoning Adjustments, as applicable shall follow their normal procedure of action
regarding conditional use permits or zoning amendments.
      (1)   If the Board of Zoning Adjustment approves the proposed project
preliminary plat, it shall issue written authorization to the applicant to
prepare a final plat to be submitted to the Planning Commission for review and
approval.

of Zoning Adjustment or the Board of Commissioners, as applicable, the
applicant shall submit the final plat of the proposed planned unit development
project to the Planning Commission for its review and approval within one (1)
year from the date of such written authorization.
      (1)   The final plat shall be drawn at a scale appropriate to the size
and nature of the project and shall be essentially and substantially the same
as the preliminary plat and shall reflect all special conditions attached
during the project preliminary plat review and shall contain all information
required in the project preliminary plat with the following exceptions:
         (a)   The final plat shall show a true north line.
         (b)   All dimensions, angles, bearings, and similar data on the plat
shall be tied to primary control points. Location and description of such
control points shall be given.

with the city a surety bond or certified check in sufficient amount to assure
completion of all such required improvements.
         (g)   Certification on plat by the Chairperson of the Planning
Commission and Board of Zoning Adjustment that the final plat has been approved
for recording in the office of the County Court Clerk.
      (2)   Planning Commission action on final plat. Upon receipt of the final
plat of the proposed PUD project, the Planning Commission shall review the plat
for completeness and adherence to the approved preliminary plat and attached
special conditions. If the Planning Commission finds that the final plat is in
accord with the approved preliminary plat and fulfills the attached special
conditions of preliminary approval, the Planning Commission may approve the
final plat and the Chairperson of the Planning Commission shall indicate such
approval. The approved final plat, including those PUD projects approved under
the zoning amendment procedure of this chapter, shall be referred to the Board
of Zoning Adjustment for final approval.
      (3)   Board of Zoning Adjustment action on final plat. If the Board of
Zoning Adjustment approves the final plat, the Chairman of the Board of Zoning
Adjustment shall indicate such approval on the final plat and shall follow all
procedures set forth in §
156.050 regarding the approval of a conditional use permit application. The
Planned Unit Development project shall thereafter be subject to all of the
provisions of this chapter regarding conditional use permits including
recording, effect, non-compliance, time limits, and permanently satisfied
permits. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall not issue approval final plat
unless all fees required by this chapter are paid, except that:
         (a)   No fee shall be charged for the advisory meeting and informal
review with the Planning Commission.
         (b)   The fees to be charged for reviewing preliminary and final plats

   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the zoning

apply:
   (A)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to following such centerlines.
   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.

streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to
follow such centerlines.
   (F)   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in divisions (A) through (D) above shall be so construed. Distances
not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Atlas shall be determined by
the scale of the maps contained in the atlas.

those shown in the Official Zoning Atlas, or in other circumstances not covered
by divisions (A) through (E) above, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall
interpret the district boundaries.

action as provided by law, the zoning district adjoining the side of the public
way shall be extended automatically, depending on the side or sides to which
such land reverts, to include the right-of-way of such vacated public way;
thus, all regulations of the adjoining district or districts shall be extended
to include such public ways or rights-of-way.
   (J)   In every case where property has not been specifically included in a
particular zoning district, the same is hereby declared to be in the R-
1 District.
   (K)   Territory annexed to, or consolidated with, the city subsequent to the
effective date of this chapter shall be temporarily zoned per current use, as
of date of annexation or consolidation. Such districting shall be temporary,
and within one year, the Planning Commission shall recommend to the Board of
Commissioners final zoning atlas maps for the annexed territory. In the absence
of such action by the Planning Commission, the temporary zoning classification
at time of annexation of consolidation shall remain as the applicable zoning of
the area until amendment upon proper application and the Official Zoning Atlas
shall be updated accordingly.

established for the underlying districts.
   (B)   Flood Hazard District. For the purposes of this chapter, land subject
to flood shall be considered land below the one hundred (100) year flood
boundary elevations as is shown on Floodway: Flood Boundary and Floodway Map,
City of Pike, Kentucky, Pike County; Community Panels: 210193 0001, 210193
0002, 210193 0003, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
dated September 5, 1984, and which is made part of this chapter.
   (C)   Floodway. The floodway as shown on the Community Panels is established
to meet the needs of the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River to carry abnormal
flows of water in time of flood. To prevent encroachments into the floodway
which will unduly increase flood heights and damage and to prevent the loss of
life and excessive damage to property in the area of the greatest flood hazard
the following regulations shall apply. The following uses are permitted within
the floodway subject to the approval of the Planning Commission and to such
conditions as the Planning Commission may specify to protect the public
interest, and which do not conflict with uses permitted in the underlying
zoning districts.
      (1)   Open type uses, such as loading and unloading areas, parking lots,
used car lots, mobile home sales lots, signs and gardens auxiliary to uses
permitted in underlying districts,
      (2)   Storage yards for equipment and material not subject to major
damage by floods, provided such use is auxiliary to uses permitted in the
underlying districts and the materials do not include flammables such as
gasoline.
      (3)   Open type public and private recreation facilities such as public
parks, golf courses, driving ranges, drive-in theatres, and amphitheaters.
      (4)   Circus, carnival, and similar transient amusement enterprises.
      (5)   Agricultural uses.
      (6)   Utilities, road and railroad bridges, electric and other
transmission lines.
      (7)   Any other use customarily accessory or incidental to the above
uses.
   (D)   Floodway Fringe. Areas lying outside the floodway but within the area
below the one hundred (100) year flood elevation, shall be subject to the
following regulations:
      (1)   No building or structure shall be erected, and no existing building
or structure shall be extended or moved unless the main floor of solid
structure is placed above the
elevation of the one hundred (100) year flood boundary. No living space shall
be below the one hundred (100) year flood elevation.
      (2)   Foundations of all structures shall be designed to withstand flood
conditions at the site.
      (3)   Land may be filled within the floodway fringe provided such fill
areas extend twenty-five (25) feet beyond the limits of any structure erected
thereon.
      (4)   Any structure proposed to be located outside the Flood Hazard
District but within one hundred (100) feet of any main drainage channel or
stream within the city’s jurisdiction must be approved by the City Engineer.
The City Engineer shall determine, on the basis of the area of the water shed
and the probable sum of the openings needed for the stream, the size of needed
retention reservoirs or how close a structure may be built to the stream in
order to assure adequate space for the flow of flood water.
   (E)   Approval of the Planning Commission. No permit shall be issued for the
construction of any building for any use within the floodway until the plans
for such construction or use have been submitted to the Planning Commission and
approval is given in writing for such construction or use. The Planning
Commission may make its approval subject to such conditions necessary to carry
out the purpose of the Flood Hazard District. In its review of plans submitted,
the Planning Commission shall be guided by the following standards, keeping in
mind that the purpose of the floodplain is to prevent encroachment into the
floodway which will unduly increase flood heights and endanger life and
property.
      (1)   Any use permitted shall be a type not appreciably damaged by
floodwaters, provided no structures for human habitation shall be permitted.
      (2)   No filling of land shall be permitted, except where express
permission is granted by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Any structure permitted shall be designed, constructed, and placed
on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water.
      (4)   Any structure permitted shall be firmly anchored to prevent the
structure from floating away and thus threatening to further restrict bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the stream.
      (5)   Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, topographic data,
engineering, and other studies are needed to determine the effects of flooding
on a proposed structure or the effects of the structure on the flow of water,
the Planning Commission may require the applicant to submit such data or other
studies prepared by competent technical specialists.
      (6)   The granting of approval of any structure or use shall not
constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind or nature by
the city, the Planning Commission, or any city official or staff member of
either the practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed and shall
create no liability upon or cause action against such public body, officer, or
employee for any damage that may result pursuant to the granting of approval.
      (7)   All construction in the identified flood hazard area shall in all
aspects be in compliance with the city floodplain regulations as contained in
Chapter 152.

§ 156.130 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   (1)   Except for approved on-street loading spaces designated by the
city on existing streets and public alleyways, off-street loading space shall
be provided for all retail uses as well as for any expansion of such uses or
for changes in use requiring regular delivery or shipping of goods,
merchandise, or equipment by semi-trailer trucks, in accordance with the
requirements of this section.
      (2)   If a request to waive and/or modify the off-street loading space
requirements for properties in the CBD (C-3) is made as part of a tax
moratorium application in §
35.08 or an application for a grant or incentive in §
124.05, the City Commission may review available data and make a determination
as to whether to waive and/or modify the requirements for the specific building
under consideration.
   (B)   (1)   Off-street parking shall be provided for all uses of land,
structures and buildings as well as for any expansion of such uses or changes
in use in accordance with the requirements of this section. No parking spaces
required for any use located in any other zoning district shall be located in
any other zoning district. In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements
for off-street parking or loading space shall be the sum of the requirements
for the various uses computed separately.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Adjustments shall have the power to hear and
decide on applications for off-street parking and loading requirement variances
whereby reason of the size or location of the lot or the unavailability of
alternative off-site parking, or such other exceptional or extraordinary
situation or condition of that site, the literal enforcement of the off-street
parking and loading requirements of the zoning regulations would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable capacity to make use of the land. In considering
such variances, the Board must consider any pre-existing parking needs or
requirements for the site if there was a pre-existing use, the effect of any
additional parking requirements for the proposed use on the surrounding
properties. The Board shall strive to prevent an additional burden upon
existing on-street public parking if reasonable alternatives are available to
the applicant to satisfy all or part of the off-street parking and loading
requirements set forth herein. The Board may impose any reasonable conditions
or restrictions on any off-street parking and loading variance it decides to
grant.
   (C)   All required parking or loading space shall be located on the same
zoning lot as the principal use or uses it serves, except as is provided for in
accordance with the following provisions.
   (D)    In lieu of actual construction of required on-site parking spaces,
all or any portion of the off-street parking required in this section may be
provided by the following means:
      (1)   Required parking for a use on a zoning lot may be located on
another zoning lot, either by itself or combined with parking for other uses,
subject to the approval and certification by the Board of Zoning Adjustment
that the following requirements have been met:
         (a)   The land use being served by the off-site parking shall be a
permitted principal or special use in the zoning district within which the
zoning lot containing such parking is located.
         (b)   For all zones except C-3, the off-site parking spaces are
located within seven hundred (700) feet walking distance of a public entrance
to the structure or land area containing the use for which such spaces are
required. A safe, direct, attractive, lighted, and convenient pedestrian route
exists or shall be provided between the off-site parking and the use being
served.
         (c)   The continued availability of off-site parking spaces necessary
to meet the parking requirements of this section shall be assured by an
appropriate restriction on the title to the land providing the off-site parking
spaces, in the form of a declaration, covenant, or contract.
         (d)   If a request to waive and/or modify off-street parking
requirements for properties in the CBD (C-3) is made as part of a tax
moratorium application in §
35.08 or an application for a grant or incentive in §
124.05. the City Commission may review available data and make a determination
as to whether to waive and/or modify the requirements for the specific building
under consideration.
      (2)   Up to one-half (1/2) of the parking spaces required for one use may
be used to satisfy the parking requirements for either a second use on the same
zoning lot or a use for which the provisions of division (1) are used, subject
to the approval and certification of the Board of Zoning Adjustment that such
joint usage of parking complies with the following provisions:
         (a)   The peak usage of the parking facility by one use will be at
night or on Sundays (such as theaters, assembly halls, churches, or
residences), and the peak usage of the parking facility by the second use will
be at other times.
         (b)   The second use is an ancillary use to the first use, such as
restaurants and meeting rooms to hotels and motels.
         (c)   Required parking area shall be available for the parking of
operable vehicles of residents, customers, and employees, and shall not be used
for the storage of vehicles or materials, or for the parking of vehicles used
for loading or unloading, or in conducting the use.
   (E)   Parking design standards. All parking areas shall meet the following
minimum design requirements:
      (1)   Ingress and egress to and from parking areas shall conform to the
city's performance standards for access in §
156.129.
      (2)   In the C-3 zone (Central Business District), if a setback is
provided between a principal structure and its fronting street, such setback
shall not be used for off-street parking.
      (3)   Except for single-family detached or two-family semi-detached

public street right-of-way. Parking vehicles in off-street parking spaces shall
be prevented from intruding on travel lanes, walkways, public streets, or
adjacent properties by means of walls, curbs, wheelstops, or other appropriate
means.
      (5)   The size of parking spaces shall be adequate for the safe parking
of vehicles. Sufficient maneuvering space shall be provided so that parking and
unparking can be accomplished in one continuous maneuver. Except for single-
and two-family dwellings, each parking space shall be arranged so that any
vehicle may be parked or unparked without moving another vehicle.
      (6)   The minimum area for each parking space, including circulation and
maneuvering space, shall be a minimum of three hundred seventy (370) square
feet. Parking facilities designed to accommodate five (5) or more vehicles
shall be designed in accordance with the standards for stalls and aisles as set
forth and illustrated below. Where parking facilities are designed to
accommodate more than ten (10) vehicles, up to fifty percent (50%) of the
parking spaces may be designed in accordance with the standards set forth
below, provided the smaller spaces are designated to be used only by compact
vehicles. For parking facilities designed for twenty-five (25) or more vehicles
at least one (1) parking space, twelve (12) feet in width, shall be provided
for each fifty (50) spaces or major fraction thereof, and designated for use
only by handicapped persons.
[ILLUSTRATION]
      (7)   Curbed islands shall be required at the ends of or between parking
aisles where necessary for traffic control or drainage control.
      (8)   Except for single- or two-family dwellings, parking spaces shall be
provided with adequate aisle or turnaround areas so that all vehicles may enter
adjacent streets in a forward manner.

vision of the driver of any motor vehicle, or otherwise interfere with the
driver's operation of a motor vehicle, or resemble traffic or directional
signals, warnings or other similar signals which are normally associated with
highway safety. Additionally, it shall be effectively shielded as to prevent

exception permit approval if electronic message board signage is desired. Signs
identifying mixed use developments with multiple tenants in the aforementioned
zoning districts shall be limited to one (1) free-standing directory sign per
development, which may utilize electronic message displays approved by either
special exception permit by the Board of Zoning Adjustments, either single or

         (b)   The application of the particular provision of this subchapter
to a particular piece of property, due to extraordinary and exceptional
conditions pertaining to that property because of its size, shape, or
topography, would create an unnecessary hardship for the owner by causing no
detriment to the public or adjacent properties.
   (E)   Denial.
      (1)   Incomplete, false statements. The Codes Enforcement Officer shall

permit. The Codes Enforcement Officer shall give notice to the applicant of his
or her decision by hand delivery or by mailing such notice by certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before
the fifteenth business day. If the decision of the Codes Enforcement Officer is
to deny the application, the decision shall state the grounds upon which the
denial is based. Failure of the city to act within the fifteen-day period shall
be deemed a denial of the permit. If notice is mailed in conformity with this
section, notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of mailing.
Any application meeting the standards of this subchapter will be granted. Any
application not meeting the standards of this subchapter will be denied.
      (3)   Appealable. A denial pursuant to this section shall be appealable
pursuant to the procedures for zoning appeals outlined in this chapter.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, a final decision will be rendered
within ninety (90) days from date an appeal is filed.
      (4)   Re-submission. A denied application later resubmitted in conformity
with this subchapter shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of re-
submission, instead of the original submission date. An application which is
resubmitted shall meet all the standards for an original application.
   (F)   Revocation.
      (1)   Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to

decision sought to be appealed shall be affirmed. The permit for any sign not
meeting the standards of this subchapter will be revoked.
   (G)   Suspension; termination.
      (1)   Violation. A violation of any provision of this subchapter shall be
grounds for terminating the permit granted by the city to the permittee or the
person or entity erecting the sign. No permit shall be suspended, revoked, or
canceled except for due cause, as hereinafter defined, and until after the
permittee is granted a public hearing before the city's Hearing Officer.
      (2)   Hearing. The permittee shall be given ten (10) days written notice
of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing, with a statement of the reason
for the suspension, revocation or canceling of such permit and license. The
term DUE CAUSE means the violation of the standards of this subchapter. The
termination of the permit does not in any way preclude the city from taking any
other action authorized by this code or any action authorized by law, against
the person alleged to have violated the standards of this subchapter.
   (H)   Expiration date.
      (1)   A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the
permit was issued has not been installed and completed within six (6) months
after the date of issuance; provided, however, that where an applicant can
demonstrate that a commercial entity was timely engaged to construct the
permitted sign, but the fabrication has not yet been completed, one (1) ninety-
day extension may be granted by the Codes Enforcement Officer.
      (2)   No refunds shall be made for a permit after the permit is issued.
If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new
application for the sign must be processed and another fee paid in accordance
with the fee schedule applicable at such time.
   (I)   Inspection. The enforcement personnel are hereby empowered to enter
into and inspecting the building, structure, or premise upon which a sign
subject to this section is located for the purpose of inspecting the sign, it's
structural and electrical connections, and to ensure compliance with the

§ 156.150 MAINTENANCE OF SIGNS.
   (A)   Signs lawfully existing on the date of adoption of this subchapter,
which do not conform to the provisions of this subchapter, shall be deemed to
be legal nonconforming "grandfathered" signs and may remain, except as
otherwise specifically qualified in this subchapter. Such signs shall not be
enlarged, extended, structurally reconstructed, replaced, or altered in any
manner; except a sign face may be changed so long as the new sign face does not
increase either height or sign area. This provision shall not have the effect
of excusing any violation of any other ordinance, nor shall this provision have
the effect of permitting the continued existence of any unsafe sign or any sign
that is not in good state of repair.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent keeping in good
repair a nonconforming sign. No repairs other than minor maintenance and upkeep
of nonconforming signs shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with
the requirements of this subchapter. A nonconforming sign which has been
declared by the city to be unsafe because of its physical condition shall not
be repaired, rebuilt, or restored unless such repair or restoration will result
in a sign which conforms to all applicable provisions of this subchapter.
   (C)   All nonconforming signs because of the need for additional inspection,
monitoring for compliance with this section and for the insurance that the
nonconforming sign remains in safe condition, shall be subject to the following
additional requirements:
      (1)   Pay a nonconforming sign fee in the yearly sum of five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
      (2)   Provide to the city on a yearly basis a certification by a licensed
professional engineer or architect that the sign is in compliance with the
Kentucky Building Code, all other regulations related to safety and that all
structural components are structurally sound and do not pose a risk of failure
or otherwise in an unsafe condition to the public, private, or public property
or individuals needing to work on or around the sign. The Codes Enforcement
Officer shall review the certification and if necessary request that the City
Engineer verify the accuracy of the certification.
   (D)   A nonconforming sign shall not be moved for any distance on the same
lot or to another lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform
to the provisions of this subchapter, and meet permit requirements of this
subchapter.
   (E)   If a nonconforming sign is removed or discontinued for any period of
time, except for normal maintenance and repair, as defined in this chapter, or
for maintenance of a building if such sign is attached to a building, the
subsequent erection of a sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter.
   (F)   A nonconforming sign which is changed to or replaced by a conforming
sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and thereafter such sign shall be
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (G)   As a consequence, when a nonconforming sign is destroyed or damaged by
any casualty to the extent not exceeding 40% of its appraised value may be
restored within sixty (60) days after such destruction or damage that shall not
be enlarged or moved in any manner.
   (H)   If such sign is so destroyed and damaged to the extent exceeding 40%,
it shall not be reconstructed except for a sign which would be in accordance
with the provisions of this section. It shall be incumbent upon the applicant
to supply the Codes Enforcement Officer with any necessary information needed
in order to determine if replacement value constitutes the sign being brought
into conformity with the existing regulations.
(Ord. O-2019-20, passed 7-22-19)
§ 156.151 REMOVAL AND DISPOSITION OF NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   The Codes and Zoning Enforcement Officer shall require compliance with
all standards of this chapter. The Officer shall require the removal in
accordance with this section of any unlawful sign. If the Officer shall certify
in writing to the Police and Fire Departments the existence of unlawful signs,
then employees of those departments are authorized to remove signs in
accordance with this section.
   (B)   Unlawful signs. In case any sign shall be installed, erected,
constructed, or maintained in violation of any of the terms of this subchapter,
the Codes and Zoning Enforcement Officer shall notify in writing the owner,
agent, or person having the beneficial use of the building, structure, or lot
upon which the sign may be found to alter such sign so as to comply with this
subchapter within ten (10) days. Upon failure to comply with such notice within
the time specified, the Codes Enforcement Officer is hereby authorized to cause
removal of such sign, and any expense incident thereto shall be paid by the
owner of the building, structure, or lot to which such sign is attached, and
same shall constitute a lien against the property in the same manner as the
city ad valorem taxes.
   (C)   Unlawful signs on public property. The Codes Enforcement Officer, or
the Police or Fire Departments, upon his certificate, shall cause to be removed
any unlawful sign on public property, rights-of-way or easements. The Codes
Enforcement Officer shall prepare a notice which shall describe the sign and
specify the violation involved and which shall state that if the sign is not
removed, or the violation is not corrected within ten (10) days the sign shall
be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section. The notice shall
be mailed to the owner of the sign, if the same can be determined. With regard
to political signs in violation, the notice shall be mailed to the candidate.
If possible with regard to any other nonconforming sign, the Codes Enforcement
Officer shall make reasonable efforts to notify the person responsible for the
use stated in the notice, but failure of the Codes Enforcement Officer to
notify any person of the unlawful nature of the sign shall not prohibit further
action under this section.
   (D)   Any person having an interest in the sign may appeal the determination
of the Codes Enforcement Officer ordering removal or compliance, by filing a
written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within ten (10) days after the
date of the notice of the Codes Enforcement Officer, who shall refer the matter
to the city's Hearing Officer.
   (E)   Notwithstanding the above, unlawful signs on public property, rights-
of-way or easements that endanger the public safety such as a sign that blocks
or impedes traffic or traffic view, an abandoned sign, a dangerous,
electrically or structurally defective sign, may be immediately removed by the
Codes Enforcement officer without notice to the owner(s) thereof.
   (F)   Any sign removed by the city or its employees pursuant to the
provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be
disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The costs of removal
of the sign by the city shall be considered a debt owed to the city by the
owner of the sign and may be recovered in an appropriate court action by the
city. The costs of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses
incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal.
   (G)   If it shall be necessary for the Codes Enforcement Officer to remove a
sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and is practicable to sell or
salvage any materials derived in the aforesaid removal, he or she may sell the
same at private or public sale at the best price obtainable, and shall keep an
account of the proceeds thereof. These proceeds, if any, shall be used to
offset the costs of removal, to be charged to the sign owner. Any excess over
those costs, and the costs of the removal shall be considered a debt by the
owner of the sign against the city. Should the proceeds exceed the costs, the
excess shall be paid to the owner of the signs, whenever the claim therefor is
established.
(Ord. O-2019-20, passed 7-22-19)
§ 156.152 MAINTENANCE OF SIGNS.
   (A)   All signs or outdoor advertising structures or surfaces shall be
properly maintained in good condition, so as to present a quality and orderly
appearance, and repaired to prevent threats to public health and safety and to
preserve the aesthetic appeal. The Codes Enforcement Officer shall have the
authority to order the repair, repainting, alteration, or removal of any sign
which constitutes a hazard to the health, safety, or public welfare or which is
an eyesore to the community by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation,
or obsolescence. If an outdoor advertising structure or surface is not
maintained, the Codes and Zoning Enforcement Officer shall notify in writing
the owner, agent, or person having the beneficial use of the building,
structure, or lot upon which the sign may be found, to alter such sign as to
comply with this subchapter within thirty (30) days.
   (B)   Signs are considered a neglected or dilapidated sign if any of the
following conditions are present: rust boreholes on or in the sign or sign
structure; broken, missing, loose or bent parts; faded or flaking paint; non-
operative or partially non-operative illumination or mechanical devices, or
missing letters in the sign.
   (C)   The enforcement officer, after notice and subject to the appeal as
provided for in §
156.151(B) through (D), may have any sign removed which shows gross neglect or
is becoming dilapidated.

§ 157.06 DESIGNATION OF LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The Board shall recommend to the Board of Commissioners the
designation of individual landmarks and historic districts, and the Board of
Commissioners shall make these designations by the enactment of ordinances.
Each designation of a landmark shall include its entire lot including related
buildings and structures and the land that provides the grounds, the premises
and the setting for the landmark.
   (B)   Consideration of the designation of a landmark or a historic district
may be originated by the Board or by the filing of an application for
designation by a property owner, any resident of the city or any organization
in the city. A person or an organization proposing a designation shall give the
Board the names and addresses of the owners of the affected property and the
owners of all adjoining property as listed on the tax rolls of the city.
   (C)   The Board shall assemble information about a property or district
being considered for designation and shall schedule a public hearing on the
proposed designation. Advertised notice of the hearing shall be given,
including conspicuous posting on the property or in the proposed district. At
least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing, written notice shall be
given by registered mail to the owners of property under consideration and the
owners of all adjoining property. Written notice shall be considered sufficient
when it is mailed to the person listed on the tax rolls of the city.
   (D)   Before its public hearing on the first designation in the city, the
Board shall adopt general guidelines that will apply to the city’s landmarks
and historic districts and will assist owners in the preservation and
rehabilitation of their property. The general guidelines shall include to the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and other guidelines that will apply to all
designated property in the city. Before each public hearing on a designation,
the Board may adopt additional guidelines that will supplement the general
guidelines and will apply to the property under consideration if it is
designated. The guidelines shall not limit new construction to any one
architectural style, but shall seek to preserve the character and, integrity of
the landmark or the historic district. The guidelines shall suggest changes
that would be appropriate for landmarks or for property in historic districts.
After a designation, the Board may expand or amend the guidelines it has
adopted provided it holds a public hearing on the changes and submits the
proposed changes to the Board of Commissioners for its comments.
   (E)   Owners and any interested parties may present testimony and evidence
at the public hearing on the designation. The record on the designation may
also include letters received by the Board.
   (F)   A landmark or historic district shall qualify for designation when it
meets one (1) or more of the following criteria which shall be discussed in a
Board report making its recommendations to the Board of Commissioners:
      (1)   Its value as a visible remainder of the cultural heritage of the
city, state or nation;
      (2)   Its location as a site of a significant local, state or national
event;
      (3)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the city, state or nation;
      (4)   Its identification as the work of a builder, designer or architect
whose work has influenced the development of the city, state or nation;
      (5)   Its value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that retains sufficient elements showing its architectural
significance;
      (6)   Its value as a building with distinguishing characteristics of an
architectural style that are significant for the study of a period, method of
construction or use of materials;
      (7)   Its character as a geographically definable area possessing a
significant concentration of buildings that are well designed and other
structures all of which are united by past events or by a plan or physical
development; or
      (8)   Its character as an established and geographically definable
neighborhood, united by culture, architectural styles or physical development.
   (G)   After evaluating the testimony and evidence at its public hearing, and
all letters, survey information and other material it has assembled, the Board
shall make its recommendation to the Board of Commissioners with a written
report on the property or area under consideration.
   (H)   The Joint Planning Commission shall then report on the relationship
between the proposed designation and existing and future plans for the
development of the city. If the Joint Planning Commission approves of the
proposed designation; it shall amend the comprehensive plan to include the
proposed designation and shall recommend a change in the zoning map to show the
proposed historic designation. The Joint Planning Commission shall forward its
comments, the Comprehensive Plan amendment, and the zoning map change to the
Board of Commissioners. If the Joint Planning Commission does not approve the
proposed designation, it shall forward its comments to the Board of
Commissioners.
   (I)   The Board of Commissioners shall approve, modify or disapprove the
proposed designation within sixty (60) days after receiving the recommendation
of the Board and the material from the Joint Planning Commission. If the Board
of Commissioners decides to make a designation and no comprehensive plan
amendment has been adopted and no zoning map change has been recommended, the
Board of Commissioners shall request the Joint Planning Commission to
reconsider its earlier decision and shall provide that the designation shall
take effect after these preliminary steps have been approved.
   (J)   A historic district shall be an overlay zoning district as provided in
the Zoning Code and shall be subject to the use and development regulations and
other rules of its underlying zoning district. A landmark shall be subject to
the use and development regulations and other rules of its zoning district.
When there is a conflict between this chapter and the use and development
regulations and other rules of the zoning district, the provisions of this
chapter shall be applied.
   (K)   The Board shall notify each owner of the decision relating to his
property and shall arrange that the designation of a property as a landmark or
as a part of a historic district be recorded in the land records of the county.
The Board shall ask that fees be waived for the city documents recording the
designations, the Board shall also give notice of the decision to the
government offices in the city and county which shall retain them for future
reference.
   (L)   The amendment or rescission of any designation shall be accomplished
through the same steps as were followed in the original designation.

§ 157.07 REVIEW OF CHANGES TO LANDMARKS AND PROPERTY IN HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   (A)   A certificate of appropriateness from the Board shall be required
before a person may undertake the following actions affecting a landmark or a
property in a historic district:
      (1)   Alteration of the exterior part of a designated historic property
that is visible to the public and may be seen by a person located on a public
street;
      (2)   New construction;
      (3)   Demolition; or
      (4)   Relocation.
   (B)   The Building Inspector shall forward to the Board every application
for a permit that would authorize an exterior alteration visible to the public,
or any new construction, demolition or relocation affecting a landmark or a
property in a historic district. When a person wishes to undertake an exterior
alteration visible to the public affecting a landmark, or a property in a
historic district that does not require a building permit, that person shall
apply directly to the Board. The applicant shall provide the Board, where
applicable, with drawings of the proposed work, photographs of the existing
building and adjacent properties, and information about the building materials
to be used.
   (C)   The Board shall hold a public hearing on each certificate of
appropriateness within thirty (30) days after a completed application is
received by the Board. The Board shall make a decision on the application
within forty five (45) days after the receipt of a completed application
provided that the Board may extend the time for decision for an additional
sixty (60) days when the application is for demolition or new construction. The
Board shall approve or disapprove each application, and it shall give its
reasons for its decision using the criteria contained in this section and its
guidelines. The Board may suggest modifications to an application and may then
approve a certificate of appropriateness providing for revisions in the plans
submitted. If the Board fails to decide on an application within the specified
time period, the application shall be deemed approved. Applicants shall be
given notice of the public hearings and meetings relating to their application
and shall be informed of the Board’s decision. Advertised notice of the hearing
shall be given, including conspicuous posting on the property.
   (D)   (1)   In making a decision on an application, the Board shall use the
general guidelines and the guidelines it has adopted for that landmark or
historic district. The Board shall consider:
         (a)   The effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the property
upon which such work is to be done;
         (b)   The relationship between such work and other property in the
historic district.
      (2)   In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the Board shall
consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style,
design, arrangement, texture, materials and color. The certificate from the
Board shall not relieve the property owner from complying with the requirements
of other state and local laws and regulations.
   (E)   In making a decision on an application, the Board shall be aware of
the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the applicant. The
Board shall also recognize the importance of approving plans that will be
reasonable for the applicant to carry out. Before an applicant prepares his
plans, he may bring a tentative proposal to the Board for its comments. The
Board shall not regulate the color of paint used on designated historic
properties, but it may prepare and distribute material on paint colors
appropriate for different types and styles of buildings. The Board shall
strongly consider the cost in the community of obtaining the requirements set
forth by the Board in regard to the plans of the applicant as compared with the
cost of conventional construction.
   (F)   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark or a building or
structure in a historic district, the Board shall negotiate with the applicant
to see if an alternative to demolition can be found. The Board may ask
interested individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking alternative
to demolition and in obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs for the
threatened building. After its public hearing, the Board may decide that a
building or structure may be demolished because it does not contribute to the
historic district or the landmark. On all other demolition applications, the
Board shall study the question of economic hardship for the applicant and shall
determine whether the landmark or the property in the historic district can be
put to reasonable beneficial use without the approval of the demolition
application. In the case of an income-producing building, the Board shall also
determine whether the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from his
existing building. The Board may ask applicants for additional information to
be used in making these determinations. If economic hardship or the lack of a
reasonable return is not proved, the Board shall deny the demolition
application unless the Board finds grounds to grant the demolition application
under the points contained in division (D) of this section.
   (G)   (1)   When an applicant wishes to move a landmark or a building or
structure in a historic district or wishes to move a building or structure to a
landmark or to a property in a historic district, the Board shall consider:
         (a)   The contribution the building or structure makes to its present
setting;
         (b)   Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated;
         (c)   Whether the building or structure can be moved without
significant damage to its physical integrity; and
         (d)   The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed
site and adjacent properties.
      (2)   These considerations shall be in addition to the points contained
in division (D) of this section.
   (H)   In the event work is being performed without the required certificate
of appropriateness, the Board shall ask that a stop work order be issued. In
the event work is being performed that is not in accordance with the
certificate approving the proposed work, the Board shall ask that a stop work
order be issued. All work shall cease on the designated historic property, and
no additional work shall be undertaken as long as the stop work order shall
continue in effect. The city can apply in Circuit Court for an injunction to
enforce its stop work order.
   (I)   The applicant shall have the right to appeal to the Circuit Court from
a decision of the Board on an application for a certificate of appropriateness.
   (J)   A certificate of appropriateness shall remain valid for one year after
it is issued. Work is required to start before the end of the one-year period.
If actual work has not commenced within one year, the certificate is invalid.
Actual work is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials
in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or
demolition is required preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition
shall be deemed to be actual work provided that it shall be carried out
diligently.

§ 157.08 EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.
   In any case where the Building Inspector determines that there are emergency
conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting a landmark or a
property in a historic district, he may order the remedying of these conditions
without the approval of the Board. The Building Inspector shall promptly notify
the Chairman of the Board of the action being taken.
(Ord. 0-90-028, passed 8-27-90)
§ 157.09 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF LANDMARKS AND PROPERTY IN HISTORIC
DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a landmark or a property
in a historic district does not change its exterior appearance that is visible
to the public. The work shall involve the use of the same building materials or
available materials that are as close as possible to the original.
   (B)   (1)   Every person in charge of a landmark or a property in a historic
district shall keep in good repair:
         (a)   All of the exterior portions of such buildings or structures;
and
         (b)   All interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may
cause such buildings or structures to deteriorate or to become damaged or
otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair.
      (2)   The purpose of this provision is to prevent a person from forcing
the demolition of his building by neglecting it and permitting damage to the
building by weather or vandalism. No provision in this chapter shall be
interpreted to require an owner or tenant to undertake an alteration or to
restore his building to its original appearance.
   (C)   The Board shall request a meeting with a property owner when his
landmark or his building in a historic district is in poor repair, and the
Board shall discuss with the owner ways to improve the condition of his
property. After this step, the Board may request the Building Inspector to take
action to require correction of defects in any building or structure designated
under this chapter so that such building or structure shall be preserved in
accordance with the purposes of this chapter. Action taken by the city may
include boarding up the doors, windows and other parts of the building and
additional steps to stabilize walls, roofs and other parts of the building or
structure.
   (D)   The provisions of this section shall be in addition to all other
provisions of the Kentucky Building Code requiring buildings and structures to
be kept in good repair.

§ 157.10 VACANT LOTS IN A HISTORICAL DISTRICT.
   The Board shall request a meeting with the owner of each vacant lot in a
historic district, and shall discuss with each owner ways to maintain the
vacant lot so that it will contribute to the preservation of the historic
district. The Board may prepare plans to improve the appearance of a vacant lot
in the historic district.
(Ord. O-2021-10, passed 4-26-21)
§ 157.11 CONFORMITY WITH THE CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall
conform to the provisions of such certificate. It shall be the responsibility
of the Building Inspector to inspect from time to time any work being performed
to assure such compliance. In the event the work being performed which is not
in accordance with such certificate, the Police Chief or the Citv Codes
