   (A)   Any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of this city
shall make a request for inspection at the office of the City Clerk/Treasurer
during regular office hours, except during legal holidays. The official
custodian, or the custodian acting under the authority of the official
custodian, may require a request to inspect public records to be in writing,
signed by the applicant and with the applicant’s name printed legibly on the
application. A written request to inspect public records may be presented by
hand delivery, mail, or via facsimile, if one is available.
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in compliance
with this chapter and the open records law, and the requested public records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection. A person may inspect public records at the designated office of the
city during the regular office hours, or in appropriate cases, by receiving
copies of the records through the mail.
   (C)   If the public records are to be inspected at the offices of the city,
suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk/
Treasurer or in another office of the city as determined by the official
custodian or custodian for the inspection. No person shall remove original
copies of public records from the offices of the city without the written
permission of the official custodian of the record.
When public records are inspected at the city offices, the person inspecting
the records shall have the right to make abstracts and memoranda of the public
records and to obtain copies of all written public records. When copies are
requested, the custodian may require advance payment of the prescribed fee.
   (D)   Upon proper request, the city shall mail copies of the public records
to a person whose residence or principal place of business is located outside

which the public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 35.18 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are

official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies thereof. However, refusal under this section must be sustained by
clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 35.19 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.

period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in part,
inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific exception

electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and the format conforms
to the requestor’s requirements, the public record may be provided in this
alternate electronic format for standard fees as
specified by the public agency. Any request for a public record in a form other
than the forms described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized
request.

fee for making copies of nonexempt public records requested for use for
noncommercial purposes which shall not exceed the actual cost of reproduction,
including the costs of the media and any mechanical processing cost incurred by
the public agency, but not including the cost of staff required. If a public
agency is asked to produce a record in a nonstandardized format, or to tailor
the format to meet the request of an individual or a group, the public agency
may at its discretion provide the requested format and recover staff costs as
well as any actual costs incurred.

requested for a commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the
requestor stating the commercial purpose for which they shall be used, and may
require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract
shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a
specified fee.

interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled.
   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.

which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.

Kentucky Revised Statutes as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.

property owner. When a property owner desires that a new sewer installation be
made on private property, and in the case of any sewer repairs on private
property which are made by the city, all materials shall be purchased through
the city, or should the property owner wish to purchase their own materials, a
list of such proposed materials shall be submitted to the city and approved by
the city before work begins. In either or any event, the property owner shall
be responsible for the cost of all materials which are installed on private
property and shall prepay or reimburse the city for any such costs incurred by
the city.
   (D)   All work for sewer installation and repairs to be approved by the City
and/or County Health Department with the cost of all such work and approvals to
be the responsibility of the property owner. When a property owner desires that
a new sewer installation be made on private property, and in the case of any
sewer repairs on private property which are to be connected to the city sewer
collection system, all work shall be done in accordance with any and all
applicable regulations. All new sewer installations shall be approved by the
County Health Department at the property owner's expense. The property owner
shall further be responsible for hiring and paying for a licensed electrician
as required for any new sewer installation.

a utility deposit to the city, which deposit has not been credited or returned
to the customer, and the city is unable to find evidence in city records that
such utility deposit was provided by such customer, which has not been credited
or returned, the customer shall be required to produce proof that such deposit

occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes, situated within the city
and abutting on any street, alley, or right-of-way in which there is now
located or may in the future be located a public sanitary sewer of the city, is
hereby required at the owner’s expense to install suitable toilet facilities
therein, and to connect the facilities directly with the public sewer in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, within 30 days after date of
official notice to do so provided that the public sewer is within 100 feet
(30.5 meters) of the property line.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy
vault, septic tank, cesspool, or other facility intended or used for the
disposal of wastewater where public sanitary sewer service is available, as
defined in §
52.01, except as provided for §
52.03. The existence within the city wherever the services of the city sanitary
sewage collection, treatment, and disposal facilities are available, or may
hereafter be made available (as the term “available” is hereinbefore defined),
of septic tanks, seepage laterals, privies, earth pits, cesspools, sanitary
waste vaults, sewage drainage fields, private sewage disposal systems, or any
other such facilities or works for the disposition of sanitary sewage wastes
other than the facilities of the city is hereby declared to be a menace to the
public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens and inhabitants of
the city is hereby determined and declared to constitute a public nuisance. The
existence of the facilities as toilets, sinks, wash basins, shower baths,
bathtubs, any commercial or industrial machinery or device producing a liquid
waste product, and the like, in or upon any improved property or premises in
the city where the facilities of the city’s sewage collection, treatment, and
disposal system are available or may hereafter be made available, is similarly
declared to be a menace to the public health and general welfare of the city
and its inhabitants, unless the facilities are connected to the city’s sewage
collection, treatment, and disposal system. The Superintendent may prescribe
the type and manner of connection to the facilities, and may require that each
connection be supervised and inspected by an authorized and qualified agent of
the city’s sewer department.
      (3)   At the time as a public sewer becomes available to a property
served by a private wastewater disposal system, a direct connection shall be
made to the public sewer system within 90 days in compliance with this chapter,
and any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar private wastewater disposal
facilities shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with suitable material or
salvaged and removed.
   (B)   Unlawful discharge to storm sewers or natural outlets.
      (1)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement wall
seepage or floor seepage, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other
sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain
which in turn in connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
Any such connections which already exist on the effective date of this chapter
shall be completely and permanently disconnected within 60 days of the
effective date of this chapter. The owners of any
building sewers having such connections, leaks, or defects shall bear all costs
incidental to removal of such sources. Pipes, sumps and pumps for such sources
of ground and surface water shall be separate from wastewater facilities.
Removal of such sources of water without presence of separate facilities shall
be evidence of drainage to public sanitary sewer.
      (2)   Floor, basement, or crawl space drains which are lower than ground
surfaces surrounding the building shall not be connected to the building
sanitary sewer. No sanitary inlet which is lower than six inches above the top
of the two adjacent public sanitary sewer manholes shall be connected by direct
drainage to the building sanitary sewer. At the discretion of the
Superintendent, those structures which might otherwise be prevented from
connection may at no cost to the city be allowed to utilize a backflow
prevention device, and thus use the system.
   (C)   Compliance with local, state, and federal laws. The discharge of any
wastewater into the public sewer system by any person is unlawful except in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and any more stringent state or
federal standards promulgated pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, the Clean Water Act of 1977, and subsequent amendments
and 40 C.F.R. pt. 403.

or representative”) or his representative shall have the right, at any time, to
inspect the inside or outside of the buildings or smoke test for connections,
leaks or defects to building sewers and require disconnection or repair of any
pipes carrying such water to the building sewer. Such waters shall not be
removed through the dual use of a sanitary drain sump or a sump pump to
building sanitary sewer. Discharge of such waters by a manual switchover from
sanitary sewer to storm drainage will not be an acceptable method of
separation. In case both storm and sanitary sewage is present, separate
drainage or pumping system shall be included.
      (2)   Stormwater, groundwater, and all other unpolluted drainage may be
discharged to the sewers as are used as storm sewers approved by the
Superintendent. Unpolluted cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be
discharged, on approval of the Superintendent to a storm sewer or natural
outlet. Under no circumstances shall sanitary sewage be discharged to a storm
sewer.

      (1)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement wall
seepage or floor seepage, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other
sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain
which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
Any such connections which already exist on the effective date of this chapter
shall be completely
and permanently disconnected within 60 days of the effective date of this
chapter. The owners of any building sewers having the connections, leaks, or
defects shall bear all costs incidental to removal of the sources. Pipes,
sumps, and pumps for the sources of ground and surface water shall be separate
from wastewater facilities. Removal of the sources of water without presence of
separate facilities shall be evidence of drainage to public sanitary sewer.
      (2)   Floor, basement, or crawl space drains which are lower than ground
surfaces surrounding the building shall not be connected to the building
sanitary sewer. No sanitary inlet which is lower than 6 inches above the top of
the 2 adjacent public sanitary sewer manholes shall be connected by direct
drainage to the building sanitary sewer. At the discretion of the
Superintendent, those structures which might otherwise be prevented from
connection may at no cost to the city be allowed to utilize a backflow
prevention device and thus use the system.
   (C)   Design and installation.
      (1)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building; except where 1 building stands at the rear of another on an

   (G)   Requirement for permittee compliance data reporting.
      (1)   Generally. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance
with applicable Pretreatment Standards or, in the case of a new user, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into POTW any user subject to
Pretreatment Standards and Requirement shall submit to the Superintendent a
report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the
discharge from the regulated process which are limited by Pretreatment
Standards and Requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these
process units in the user facility which are limited by the Pretreatment
Standards or Requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional pretreatment and time schedule is necessary to bring
the user into compliance with the applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the user.
      (2)   Periodic compliance reports.
         (a)   Any user subject to a Pretreatment Standard, after the
compliance date of the Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a new user,
after commencement or the discharge into the POTW shall submit to the
Superintendent during the months of June and December unless required more
frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the wastewater contribution
permit, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the
effluent which are limited by the Pretreatment Standards. In addition, this
report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting
period exceed the average daily flow. At the discretion of the Superintendent
and in consideration of the factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, and the like, the Superintendent may agree to alter the months
during which the above reports are to be submitted.
         (b)   The Superintendent may impose mass limitation on users where
their imposition is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by division

Standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature
and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Superintendent
of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
Pretreatment Standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the
applicable Pretreatment Standard. All analyses shall be performed by a
laboratory acceptable to the city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance
with procedures established by the U.S. EPA Administrator pursuant to § 304(g)
of the Clean Water Act, being 33 U.S.C. 1314(g) and contained in 40 C.F.R. pt.
136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
U.S. EPA Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
         (c)   Where 40 C.F.R. pt. 136 does not include a sampling or
analytical technique for the pollutant in question sampling and analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA
publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA
Administrator.
         (d)   All industrial users shall retain all pretreatment records for a
minimum of 3 years, as required by 40 C.F.R. pt. 403.12(o)(2).
   (H)   Monitoring facilities. The city shall require significant users to
provide and operate at the user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sever and/or
internal drainage system. The monitoring facility should normally be situated
on the user’s premises, but the city may, when such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in a public right-of-way. The Superintendent shall review and
approve the location, plans, and specifications for the monitoring facilities
and may require them to be constructed to provide for the separate monitoring
and sampling of industrial waste and sanitary sewage flows. The re shall be
ample room in or near the sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and
measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public
or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided
in accordance with the city’s requirements and all applicable local
construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed
within 90 days following approval of the location plans and specifications.
   (I)   Inspection and sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, copying records examination
or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval authority, and
EPA shall have the right to set up on the users property the devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification an clearance before entry into their premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements for their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval
authority, and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose
of performing their specific rest
   (J)   Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all
Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as
specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be pro tided,
operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city
for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the
facility. The review of the plan is and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this
chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or met hod of
operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the
user’s initiation of the change. The city is required by federal regulations to
keep the public informed of all cases of significant violation. To accomplish
this, the city shall annually publish in a newspaper of local circulation a
list of the users which were not in compliance with any Pretreatment
Requirements or Standards at least once during the 12 previous months. A
significant violation shall meet 1 or more of the following conditions:
      (1)   Results in the exercise of emergency authority;
      (2)   Remains uncorrected 45 days after notice of noncompliance is given;
      (3)   Involves failure to report accurately;
      (4)   Wastewater violations:
         (a)   Chronic violations - 66% or more of samples exceed the maximum
average limit for the same pollutant over a 6-month period (any magnitude of
exceedance);
         (b)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations - 33% of the samples
exceed the same limit by more than the TRC in a 6-month period:
            1.   TRC - for conventional pollutants; TRC = 1.4 or 40% over
limit; and
            2.   For all other pollutants TRC = 1.2 or 20% over limit.
         (c)   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit that the
control authority believes has caused alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference (e.g., slug loads) or pass through or has endangered
the health of the POTW personnel or the public. Any discharge causing imminent
endangerment to human health/welfare or to the environment or resulting in the
POTWs use of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
      (5)   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, failure to comply
with schedule milestones for starting or completing construction or attaining
final compliance by 90 days or more after the schedule date;
      (6)   Failure to provide required reports within 30 days of the due date;
and/or
      (7)   Any other violation or group of violations which the control
authority considers to be significant. The notification shall also summarize
any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same 12 months.
All records relating to compliance with Pretreatment Standards shall be made
available to officials of the EPA or Approval Authority upon request. All
records shall be maintained for a minimum of 3 years in accordance with 40
C.F.R. § 403.12(0)(2).
   (K)   Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs
and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests in writing and
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of the
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. When requested by the
person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public but shall be made available to governmental agencies for uses related to
this chapter, the NPDES/KPDES permit, sludge disposal system permit and/or the
pretreatment programs; provided, however, that the portions of a report shall
be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics shall not be recognized as confidential
information.

(Ord. 2003-14, passed - -)
§ 52.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Generally. The city through the POTW Superintendent or his or her
designee to insure compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40
C.F.R. Subchapter N, 401 through 471 and 401 KM. 5:055, Section 9, may take the
following enforcement steps against users in noncompliance with this chapter.
The remedies available to the POTW include injunctive relief, civil and
criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of discharges and/or water service
and the publishing of the list of significant violators annually. The
Enforcement Authority shall be vested in the Superintendent of the POTW or his
or her designer. All violations of requirements must be reviewed and responded
to by the Control Authority (POTW Superintendent). Generally, the Control
Authority shall notify the industrial user when a violation is found. For all
violations, the Control Authority shall receive an explanation and, as
appropriate, a plan from the industrial user to correct the violation within a
specific time period. If the violations persist or the explanation and/or plan
are not adequate, the Control Authority’s response shall be more formal and
commitments (or schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in
an enforceable document. The enforcement response selected will be related to
the seriousness of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if
compliance is not achieved expeditiously after the initial action. A serious
violation will require a formal enforcement action. The full scale of
enforcement actions will be as detailed in the Enforcement Response Plan.
   (B)   Enforcement actions.
      (1)   Informal notice to industrial user. These actions include
statements made to user during sampling and/or inspection visits. Telephone
calls to the appropriate official, informal meetings, warning or reminder
letters. These informal notices shall be used for minor violation.
      (2)   Formal actions.
         (a)   Notice of violation. Any person found to be violating any
provision of this chapter wastewater permit or any order issued hereunder shall
be served by the POTW Superintendent with a written notice stating the nature
of the violation. The offender shall permanently cease all violation
         (b)   Administrative orders/administrative fines. Any user who after
receiving a notice of violation shall continue to discharge in violation of
this chapter or other pretreatment standards or requirements or is determined
to be a chronic or persistent violator or who is determined to be a significant
violator, shall be ordered to appear before the Control Authority. At the
appearance, a
compliance schedule will be given to the nonconforming user and an
administrative fine assessed. The fine shall be determined on a case-by-case
basis which shall consider the type and severity of violations, duration of
violations, number of violations, severity of impact on the POTW, impact on
human health, users economic benefit from violation, history of violations,
good faith of the user, and shall be a non-arbitrary but appropriate amount. In
no case, shall amount exceed the amounts contained in §
52.99. The administrative order may take any of the following 4 forms. The 4
forms are defined as follows.
            1.   Cease and desist order. Directs a non-compliant user to cease
illegal, violating or authorized discharges immediately or terminate discharge
altogether. Will be used where the discharge could cause interference or pass
through or create an emergency situation. May be issued immediately upon
discovery of a problem or following a hearing. to an emergency, may be issued
by telephone and followed with a written order. May be used to order immediate
cessation of discharge regardless of user’s compliance status. If user fails to
comply with order, Control Authority may take independent action, such as
termination of water service or disconnection of user sewer discharge point.
            2.   Compliance orders. A compliance order directs the user to
achieve or restore compliance by a date specified in the order. It is issued
unilaterally and its terms need not be discussed with the industry in advance.
The compliance order is usually issued when noncompliance cannot be resolved
without construction, repair, or process changes. Compliance orders are also
used to require industrial users to develop management practices, spill
prevention programs and related Control Authority pretreatment program
requirements. The compliance order shall document the noncompliance and state
required actions to be accomplished by specific dates, including interim and
final reporting requirements. The compliance schedule shall be firm but
reasonable taking into consideration all factors relevant to an appropriate
schedule duration.
            3.   Consent orders. The consent order is an agreement between the
Control Authority and the industrial user normally containing 3 elements:
compliance schedules; stipulated fines or remedial actions; and signatures of
Control Authority and industry representatives. It contains some flexibility in
the form of a negotiated settlement. A consent order is used when the user
assumes responsibility for its noncompliance and is willing (in good faith) to
correct its cause(s). The user need not admit the noncompliance in the text of
the order. Signing the order is neither an admission of liability for purposes
of civil litigation nor a plea of guilty for purposes of criminal prosecution.
However, the Control Authority must make sure that the consent order prohibits
future violations and provides for corrective action on the part of the
industry.
            4.   Show cause orders. An order to show cause directs the user to
appear before the Control Authority, explain its noncompliance and show cause
why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not go forward. The
order to show cause issued after informal contacts or NOVs have failed to
resolve the noncompliance. However, the show cause order/hearing can also be
used to investigate violations of previous orders.
            5.   Show cause hearing. The POTW Superintendent may issue to any
user who causes or contributes to violations of this chapter, wastewater permit
or order issued hereunder an order to appear and show cause why more severe
enforcement action should not be taken. Whether or not a duly
notified user or its representative appears, immediate enforcement action may
be pursued. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
of a hearing to be held by the city regarding the violation, the reasons why
the action. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
of a hearing to be held by the city regarding the violation, the reasons why
the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the
user to show cause before the city more severe enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (3)   Hearing. The city itself will conduct the hearing and take the
evidence, or may designate a representative to:
         (a)   Issue in the name of the city notices of hearings requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in the hearings;
         (b)   Take the evidence; and
         (c)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city for
action thereon.
      (4)   Testimony. At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony
taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so
recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to
the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
      (5)   Order. After the city has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenance are properly
operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be
issued.

   (B)   Revocation of permit.
      (1)   Any user who violates the following conditions of this chapter, or
applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to having his or her
permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of this chapter:
         (a)   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his or her discharge;
         (b)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations,
or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
         (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
         (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
      (2)   At the POTW’s option, a short-term permit maybe issued.

§ 52.11 SEWER BILLING ADJUSTMENTS.
   The city may allow for an adjustment to a sewer customer's bill, but only
under certain conditions and frequencies as follows:
   (A)   In order for a sewer account to request an adjustment on sewer usage
for livestock or farming operations, the sewer account must be current, and the
sewer account holder must first have an hour meter installed by the city. The
city shall absorb the initial cost of the hour meter but the sewer customer
shall be responsible for the costs of materials and labor to maintain, repair
and replace the hour meter as needed, and shall prepay the city's estimate for
such expenses in advance of any repairs or replacements, and any amounts
incurred over the estimate shall be added to the sewer customer's bill and
shall be payable by the sewer customer and recoverable by the city in the same
manner as other utility costs.
   (B)   Each sewer account, which is current, may request 1 sewer account
adjustment during every 12-month period for filling up 1 swimming pool on the
premises, or each sewer account shall be entitled to 1 adjustment per calendar
year for a leak.
   (C)   The sewer account adjustment shall be made based on the account's
previous 3-months’ water usage. The 3-month average of the previous water usage
on the account shall be billed to the sewer account for the billing period in
which the swimming pool is filled or in which the leak occurred.

§ 114.01 PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses an order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish uniform regulations
thereon. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose or effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and reports considered by
Council, and on findings incorporated in court cases including but not limited
to Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); Hendricks v. Commonwealth
of Kentucky 865 S.W. 2d 332 (1993), the Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   The above finding raises substantial governmental concerns.
      (3)   Requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working at such establishments.
      (4)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      (5)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for the period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which may
lead to the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior.
      (6)   The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
(Ord. 2018-7, passed 12-7-2018)

§ 151.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish a vacant
residential property registration and maintenance program as a mechanism to
protect neighborhoods and minimize hazards to persons and property as a result
of the vacancy.
(Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   CREDITOR. A Federal or state chartered bank, savings bank, savings and loan
association, or credit union, and any entity acting on behalf of the creditor
named in the debt obligation including, but not limited to, servicers.
   RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. Real property with 1 to 4 dwelling units.
   VACANT. A residential property with no legal resident or tenant. Evidence of
vacancy includes any condition that on its own, or combined with other
conditions present, would lead a reasonable person to believe that the property
is vacant. Such conditions include but are not limited to overgrown or dead
vegetation, accumulation of flyers, mail, or trash, disconnected utilities, the
absence of window coverings or furniture, and statements by neighbors, delivery
persons, or government employees.
(Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 151.03 REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Prior to filing a complaint of foreclosure or executing a deed in lieu
of foreclosure on a residential property located in the city, a creditor shall
inspect the property to determine whether the
property is vacant. If the property is vacant, the creditor shall, on the same
day the complaint of foreclosure is filed or the deed in lieu of foreclosure is
executed, register the property as a vacant property with the Office of the
City of Mount Olivet in which the property is located for the purpose of
minimizing hazards to persons and property as a result of the vacancy.
   (B)   If a residential property becomes vacant at any time after a creditor
files a complaint of foreclosure or executes a deed in lieu of foreclosure, but
prior to vesting of title in the creditor or a third party, the creditor shall,
within 10 business days after obtaining knowledge of the vacancy, register the
property as a vacant property with the city.
(Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 151.04 MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Registration of a residential property as a vacant property shall
include the address of the property and the name and contact information of a
person located within the commonwealth who is authorized to accept service on
behalf of the creditor.
   (B)   If a residential property becomes or remains vacant as provided in §
151.03, but prior to vesting of title in the creditor or any third party, and
the city determines the property is in violation of any ordinance regulating a
nuisance, the city may notify the creditor of the violation by providing notice
of the violation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person
identified in division (A) of this section, and may require the creditor to
correct the violation to the extent consistent with the terms of the mortgage.
   (C)   A notice of violation shall include a description of the conditions
that give rise to the violation with the notice of violation and shall provide
a period of not less than 20 days from the creditor's receipt of the notice for
the creditor to remedy the violation.
(Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 151.05 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   If the creditor fails to remedy the violation within the stated
period, the city may issue a citation and impose penalties against the creditor
for violation of any ordinance regulating a nuisance.
   (B)   Any creditor that fails to register vacant residential property with
the city shall be subject to a civil fine of $100 payable to the city for each
day of delinquency.
