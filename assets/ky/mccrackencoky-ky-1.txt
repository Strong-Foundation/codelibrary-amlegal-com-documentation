   (A)   The county shall possess a lien on property owned by the person found
by a final, non-appealable order as set out herein above, or by a final
judgment of the court to have committed a violation of a county ordinance for
all civil fines assessed for the violation and for all charges, fees and
abatement costs incurred by the county in connection with the enforcement of
the ordinance. An affidavit of the Code Enforcement Officer shall constitute

committed the violation shall be personally responsible for the amount of all
civil fines assessed for the violation and for all charges, fees, and abatement
costs incurred by the county in connection with the enforcement of the
applicable code. The county may bring a civil action for the collection of
delinquent liens and other costs incurred by the county in the enforcement of

32.02   Cremation services
   
32.03   Government operations during an emergency
§ 32.01 CONCEALED WEAPONS ON GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.
   (A)   It is hereby declared that the purpose of local government is to serve

and cooperation. It is to assure the safety of the citizens, officers and
employees of said government and to solve problems in the positive mood of
accord.
   (B)   The Fiscal Court of the county, after due consideration, has
determined that this purpose can best be met by the absence of concealed deadly
weapons in the places where such proceedings take place.
   (C)   Under the authorization of KRS Chapter 237, the county does hereby
prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons into the County Courthouse. The
provisions of this section, as enacted under KRS Chapter 237, shall not be
deemed to be a violation of KRS 65.870.
      (1)   A sign shall be posted at the entrance(s) of the County Courthouse,
which shall be a minimum of 18 inches square and shall read as follows: “The
possession of concealed deadly weapons, even with proper permit, is hereby
prohibited on this property.”

limited to, the following:
         (a)   Any weapon from which a shot, readily capable of producing death
or other serious physical injury, may be discharged;
         (b)   Any knife other than an ordinary pocket knife, i.e., a knife
with a blade of four and one-half inches or less;
         (c)   Billy, nightstick or club;
         (d)   Blackjack or slapjack;
         (e)   Nunchaku karate sticks;

being charged with criminal trespass in the second degree.
      (4)   Any employee of the county government or of any elected official of
the county, excluding peace officers, who violates this section shall be
subject to employee disciplinary measures.
   (D)   The adoption of this section shall be deemed to serve as public notice
that the carrying of concealed deadly weapons shall be prohibited into the
County Courthouse and shall also be posted accordingly.

10.99
§ 32.02 CREMATION SERVICES.
   (A)   Two levels of cremation services financed by the county. In light of
the important public purposes served by governmental assistance in ensuring the
proper disposition of the remains of those who would not otherwise be able to
financially procure the same, the county hereby establishes the following two
different levels of cremation services financed by the county:
      (1)   Unclaimed decedent cremation service; and
      (2)   Indigent decedent cremation assistance service.
   (B)   Unclaimed decedent cremation service.
      (1)   Qualifications for unclaimed decedent cremation service. It is an
express condition precedent that prior county financing the disposition of the
remains of an unclaimed decedent, each of the following elements be met:
         (a)   The decedent is a resident of the county;
         (b)   The decedent is in the possession of the County Coroner;
         (c)   The County Coroner, after conducting a good faith and diligent
search, is unable to locate a surviving spouse or any next-of-kin; and
         (d)   Note: notwithstanding the foregoing conditions precedent, under
extraordinary circumstances, the County Coroner’s office, with the approval of
the County Judge/Executive, may determine it is in the county’s best interest
to fund cremation services for a nonresident.
      (2)   Unclaimed decedent cremation services provided. Upon verification
of the above conditions precedent, and upon the completion of any and all
administrative policies, regulations or guidelines subsequently put in place to
facilitate the aforesaid verification, the county shall render the following
cremation service.
         (a)   The county shall cause the remains to be cremated by a licensed
funeral home in the county.
         (b)   The county shall take receipt of the cremains and cause them to
be spread upon the garden at the pauper cemetery at Wilmington.
         (c)   The county shall pay the licensed funeral home rendering the
cremation services in the amount of $750 for said services.
         (d)   It is expressly stated that the county shall not provide any
type of grave marker, nor finance the provision of any visitation or other
services at either a funeral home or at the cemetery.
      (3)   Future recoupment of county and funeral home expenditures.
         (a)   If, after the provision of the services stated in division (B)
(2) above, it is determined that an unclaimed decedent possessed any type of
assets, said assets shall be turned over to the county and subject to the
county’s initial right of recoupment and be used to defray the county’s
expenses in providing such services.
         (b)   If any additional assets exist after the full recoupment of the
county’s cremation service expenses, said assets shall escheat to the County
Fiscal Court General Fund after the one-year anniversary of the date on which
the unclaimed decedent’s assets were turned over to the county. Upon escheating
to the General Fund, the county shall pay over any remaining assets to the
licensed funeral home providing the cremation services to compensate for the
funeral home’s actual costs of services if they were in excess of what was
originally recouped from the county.
   (C)   Indigent decedent cremation assistance service.
      (1)   Qualifications for indigent decedent cremation assistance service.
It is an express condition precedent that prior county financing the
disposition of the remains of an indigent decedent, each of the following
elements be met:
         (a)   Decedent is a resident of the county;
         (b)   Decedent possesses no assets of any nature that can be used or
sold to finance cremation; and
         (c)   A family member or friend of the decedent, formally accept
financial responsibility for the disposition of the decedent’s remains.
      (2)   Indigent decedent cremation assistance services provided. Upon
verification of the above conditions precedent, and upon the completion of any
and all administrative policies, regulations or guidelines subsequently put in
place to facilitate the aforesaid verification, the county shall render the
following cremation assistance service.
         (a)   The county will contribute the amount of $750 toward the
cremation and internment of the indigent decedent’s cremains.
         (b)   Such payment shall be made directly to the licensed funeral home
after an invoice for services has been received by the county.
         (c)   At the election of the financially responsible party identified
in division (C)(1)(c) above, said party may request to receive the cremains or
may direct that the cremains be spread upon the garden at the pauper cemetery
at Wilmington.
         (d)   It is expressly stated that the county shall not provide any
type of grave marker, nor finance the provision of any visitation or other
services at either a funeral home or at the cemetery. Should the indigent
decedent cremation assistance services applicant purchase any additional
services from the funeral home in excess of basic cremation and internment,
said purchase shall invalidate the county’s aforesaid duty to contribute.
      (3)   Future recoupment of county expenditures. If after the provision of
the services stated in division (C)(2) above, it is determined that an indigent
decedent possessed any type of assets, said assets shall be turned over to the
county and subject to the county’s right of recoupment and be used to defray
the county’s expenses in providing such services.

§ 32.03 GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS DURING AN EMERGENCY.
   (A)   Definitions. The following definitions shall be in effect in the
application of this section unless context indicates otherwise.
      EMERGENCY INTERIM SUCCESSOR. A person designated by this section to
assume and exercise the powers and discharge the duties of an officer or
official upon the unavailability of that officer or official to do so in a
state of emergency. The tenure of the EMERGENCY INTERIM SUCCESSOR shall
continue until a successor is legally appointed or elected, or until the lawful
incumbent is able to resume the exercise of the powers and discharge of the
duties of the office.
      OFFICE. Includes all local offices, including the duties and powers
thereof, as established by law.
      OFFICER. The individual that lawfully holds an office.
      STATE OF EMERGENCY. A condition resulting from any incident or situation,
whether natural or manmade, that poses a major threat to public safety so as to
cause, or threaten to cause, loss of life, serious injury, significant damage
to property, or major harm to public health or the environment.
      UNAVAILABLE. Means that during a state of emergency either:
         (a)   A vacancy in office exists and there is no deputy authorized to
exercise all of the powers and discharge all of the duties of the office; or
         (b)   The lawful incumbent of the office and any duly authorized
deputy are absent or unable to exercise all of the powers and discharge all of
the duties of the office.
   (B)   Scope. This section describes and sets forth procedures for addressing
three types of disruptive situations:
      (1)   Loss of use of a governmental facility (i.e., damage to a building
or essential infrastructure, and the like);
      (2)   The absence or inability to function of an elected official;
      (3)   The loss of available services due to equipment or systems damage
or failure (i.e., information technology (IT) systems failure, and the like).
   (C)   Alternate facilities plan.
      (1)   In the event that a county governmental facility becomes damaged or
otherwise unable to house or adequately support the operation of any or all
government office functions normally in that facility, the office(s) affected,
or a portion thereof, may move to another suitable facility until the normal
facility is again usable or until other, longer-term plans are made.
         (a)   Tentative plans and suggestions for suitable facilities are
delineated herein.
         (b)   County officers are encouraged to further develop plans for how
their operations could be quickly moved into one of these facilities and
services resumed, including pre-planning of space utilization, moving
procedures, backup of equipment, and the like.
         (c)   Governmental offices and operations shall resume in their
original location as soon as it is practical for them to do so.
      (2)   The situation will dictate circumstances in which replacement
facilities should be sought; in general, when an administrative function would
be interrupted for more than two business days or in a public-safety function
for more than two hours, this plan shall be activated. If there is a county-
wide disaster or emergency, then immediate implementation of the plan shall
begin. For administrative functions, at least basic operations shall be re-
established in 12 hours or less, if at all possible.
      (3)   The facilities listed below assume that limited disruption has
occurred; i.e., that only one building or one office in a building needs to
find new quarters. If a larger-scale disruption occurs, then only partial
allocation of available space may be possible.
      (4)   Also, in general, the listings below are in order of preference for
each office and the order in which temporary facilities should be sought in the
event the need arises.
      (5)   The following delineates the suitable alternate facilities to be
utilized if needed in the course of a state of emergency:
         (a)   County Courthouse (Judge-Executive’s Office, Fiscal Court,
Treasurer’s Office, County Clerk's Office, County Attorney's Office, Coroner's
Office, County Sheriffs Office):
            1.   County Emergency Management Complex;
            2.   County Public Safety Annex;
            3.   County Rescue Headquarters;
            4.    County Emergency Operations Center;
            5.   Reidland/Farley Fire Department Station #2;
            6.   West McCracken Fire Department;
            7.   Kentucky State Police Post 1.
         (b)   County Jail (Jailer’s office). There is no backup, secure
facility suitable to house prisoners in county. The Jailer will contact
Kentucky Department of Corrections and transport all inmates to a correctional
facility that is able to house them. The Jailer’s administrative functions
could be temporarily moved to coincide with the movement of prisoners.
   (D)   Continuity of governmental leadership plans.
      (1)   State law provides for the interim appointment and the eventual
replacement election for an elected official who becomes permanently
unavailable, such as through death or permanent incapacity.
      (2)   However, there may be need for a rapid temporary replacement
process for an official who is unavailable during an emergency event.
      (3)   KRS 39D.030 and KRS 39D.040 direct local governing bodies to enact
ordinances or orders for the prompt filling of offices and employees during
times of disaster and emergency, if the filling of these vacancies is not
otherwise provided for by law.
         (a)   State law directs that not fewer than three, nor more than seven
interim successors for each position be designated.
         (b)   Emergency interim successors, in the order of their succession
as listed below, shall have the full power to exercise all powers and discharge
all duties of the office, and to commit its resources during a time of
emergency or disaster, if the person normally exercising the position is
unavailable, but shall immediately relinquish such power if the person normally
exercising the position again becomes available.
         (c)   If the preceding emergency successor becomes available, he or
she shall resume the duties being performed by the following successor, unless
he or she chooses to permit the following successor to remain in the position
until relieved.
      (4)   In other, non-emergency but urgent situations, when the officer may
be out of town but available for consultation or having left advance
directives, a duly authorized deputy may exercise the authority of the office
to an extent limited by the office holder.
      (5)   The county officials listed below may, of their own accord or at
the request of the Judge-Executive, provide to the office of the Judge-
Executive a list of planned successors as outlined above, which shall be kept
on file in that office in case the office holder becomes unavailable.
         (a)   A list so filed may be modified at any time by the county
official, in his or her sole discretion.
         (b)   Alternatively, if a county official has not provided such a
list, then the default listing set forth below shall control.
         (c)   In either event, it shall be the duty of the county official to
ensure that his or her potential successors have taken the appropriate oath for
the office to which they might succeed.
      (6)   The following gives the default listing of planned, emergency,
interim successors, in order, if the elected official becomes disabled or

agencies shall be adopted by the Agency. All user rates and charges to be
collected from all the real property within the county served by facilities of
the Agency shall remain in effect until such time as an adjustment thereof has
been approved by the Paducah City Commission and the County Fiscal Court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all tap-on fees previously established by the
Existing Agencies on existing sewer lines at the time the Agency is created
shall not be changed. Any proposed adjustments of the schedule of rates and
charges shall be recommended by the Agency at a joint meeting of the Paducah
City Commission and the County Fiscal Court. The Paducah City Commission and
the County Fiscal Court shall approve or disapprove all rate changes
recommended by the Agency by majority vote of each body. Neither the Paducah
City Commission nor the County Fiscal Court shall have the authority to
initiate rate changes. If for any reason the Paducah City Commission and the

         (a)   The consumption of water on premises connected with the
facilities, taking into consideration commercial and industrial use of water;
         (b)   The number and kind of plumbing fixtures connected with the
facilities;
         (c)   The number of persons served by the facilities;
         (d)   May be determined by the Agency on any other basis or
classification which the Agency determines to be fair and reasonable, whether
similar or dissimilar to those enumerated; except that the schedule shall be
equitable for all residential property; provided, however, pursuant to KB 739,
enacted by the 2002 Kentucky General assembly, if the Paducah City Commission,
County Fiscal Court and the Agency find that local needs warrant, uniformity of
rates for all residential property shall not be required for a period of no
more than ten years from the date the Agency was established on July 1, 1999;
or
         (e)   Any combination thereof.
      (2)   This schedule may include additional charges for treatment of
sewage, with a surcharge where the sewage contains industrial waste or other
waste in excess of limitations established by the regulations of the Agency.
   (B)   Prior to modification of the schedule of rates and charges, the Agency
shall adopt a proposed schedule and publish notice thereof pursuant to KRS
Chapter 424. The notice so published shall be dated as of the date of first
publication thereof and shall state that the proposed or revised schedule of
rates and charges will remain open for inspection in the office of the Agency
for 30 days from the date of the notice, and that objections thereto in writing
may be filed during that period with the Agency by any person aggrieved
thereby. The Board shall examine and hear any and all complaints, may modify
the proposed schedule and may recommend to the Paducah City Commission and
County Fiscal Court a final schedule within 60 days after the date of the
notice. The schedule so adopted and established shall thereafter be the rates
and charges for the use of the facilities of the Agency by users within the
county until changed in the manner provided herein.
      (1)   The schedule of rates and charges shall be established and revised
from time to time so as to produce aggregate revenues to the Agency sufficient:
         (a)   For the payment of interest on and principal of all revenue
bonds and other obligations of the Agency;
         (b)   For the payment of all costs and expenses of operating and
maintaining the sewer system of the Agency, including, but not limited to, that
portion of the salaries, wages and fees of all officers and employees of the
Agency; and
         (c)   For the payment of all costs of renewals and replacement of such
system within the county; provided, however, that all expenses, salaries, wages
and fees necessary or incident to improvements for the account of which bonds
are issued or other indebtedness incurred may be included as a part of the cost
of the improvements and paid from the proceeds of the bonds or other
indebtedness.
      (2)   The use of all monies of the Agency received from any and all
sources shall be limited exclusively and devoted solely to the payment of all
obligations of the Agency and no funds from any sources shall be diverted to
any other purposes than those described in this chapter.
   (C)   Whenever any sewer rates or charges for services rendered remain
unpaid for a period of 30 days after the same becomes due and payable, the
Agency shall declare the property, the owner thereof, and the user of the
service, delinquent until such time as all rates and charges are fully paid,
and may cut off the sewer connection and service. The Agency may enter into
agreements with any water company or water service, public or private,
providing for the discontinuance of water service to delinquents.

therein, or personal property, pursuant to the provisions of the Eminent Domain
Act of the state, and the Board shall determine that the necessity for
procuring possession of the property is urgent, it may pass a resolution, at
the time that said condemnation is authorized or at any time thereafter for a
declaration of taking, declaring that said lands are to be taken for the use of
the Agency. Said declaration of taking shall contain, or have annexed thereto,
the following:
      (1)   A statement of the authority under which and, the public use for
which, said lands are taken;

appointed. Title to said lands in fee simple or such lesser estate as is
specified in said declaration or to said personal property shall then vest in
the Agency, and the right to just compensation for said land or interest
therein or personal property shall vest in the persons entitled thereto. Said
compensation shall be ascertained and awarded in said proceeding as otherwise
provided in the Eminent Domain Act of the state.
   (E)   Any property owner whose property is proposed to be the subject of a
condemnation action by the Agency shall be provided by U.S. mail at his or her
last known address, at least five days prior to the meeting, a copy of the

sewers, but also cost of surveys, designs, plans, specifications, advertising,
inspection and administration; provided, however, these additional costs shall
not exceed 15% of the actual construction cost of the project.
   (G)   A lien superior to all liens except the liens for state, county, city,
school and road taxes and liens prior in time for other public improvements
shall exist against the respective lots or tracts of land for the cost of the
sanitary sewers, appurtenances or property service connections for
apportionment as provided herein, plus interest thereon at the rate of 6% per
annum.
   (H)   If sanitary sewers, appurtenances or property service connections are
constructed as provided in the resolution, the Agency shall not be liable for
the cost of the sanitary sewers, appurtenances or property service connections
and shall have the right to enforce such costs against the property receiving

problems are not the responsibility of the JSA. Replacement costs are the
responsibility of the property owner.
   (E)   Design and installation.
      (1)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway. In such case,
the sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer, but the JSA does not and will not
assume any obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from
any such single connection aforementioned.
      (2)   Existing building sewers may be used in connection with new
buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the JSA; to meet
all requirements of this subchapter. If additional sewer customers are added to
the old building sewers, additional sewer tap fees and capacity fees shall be
charged accordingly even though no new sewer tap is actually made into the JSA
system. At no time shall a refund be payable as a result of a decrease in ERUs.
      (3)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM A-74, latest
revision, PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) sewer pipe, ASTM D-3034, latest revision, or
ductile iron pipe, AWWA specification C-151 cement lined, and shall meet
requirements of State plumbing code. Joints shall be as set out hereinafter.
Any part of the building sewer that is located within five feet of a water
service pipe shall be constructed with cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron
pipe, unless the building sewer is at least one foot deeper in the ground than
the water service line. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe may be
required by the JSA where the building sewer is exposed to damage or stoppage
by tree roots. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe shall be used in filled

sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing and back filling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the local and state building and plumbing codes, the JSA’s standard
specifications and other applicable rules and regulations of the JSA.
      (5)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and
connection to the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s)
shall indemnify the JSA for any loss or damage to JSA facilities that may
directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
Repair costs shall be as established by the JSA.
      (6)   The owner shall ensure that all excavations for building sewer
installation are adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect
the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property
disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory
to the JSA and all owners of such public property.
      (7)   In a building where the sewer main crown is less than three and
one-half feet below the basement floor, wastewater shall be lifted by means of
a sewage pump.
      (8)   A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner surface
of the public sewer shall be made. A wye and six-inch clean-out fitting shall

the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code.
      (10)   The owner of the premises served by a sewer shall be responsible
for all maintenance, operation, cleaning of the building sewer from the
building to the point of connection with the public main line sewer. Repairs
and reconstruction of the building sewer from the building to a public roadway
shall be the responsibility of the owner. If the building sewer is damaged
under publicly owned improved surfaces, the JSA will be responsible for repair.
   (F)   Inspection.
      (1)   All holders of a sanitary sewer permit shall notify the JSA when
the activity described is completed. The construction shall be inspected by JSA
personnel prior to placing backfill material. The connection shall be made gas-
tight and water-tight and verified by proper testing.
      (2)   All building sewers shall be smoke tested, at JSA discretion,
through the wye branch at the public sewer connection, with public sewer
tightly plugged off, after connections at both ends are made and after all pipe
is properly bedded and backfilled at least to the top of the pipe and if
backfill is completed, within two weeks after completion of backfill. At time
of testing, any openings into the building drain inside the building shall be
water trapped or plugged. Any leakage of smoke from building sewer or building
drain and plumbing shall be located at test and repaired to stand repetition of
smoke test without leakage. When smoke testing is completed, the temporary flow
line plug shall be removed and a permanent watertight plug shall be placed in
branch of test wye-branch and carefully backfilled by hand and tamped to at
least six inches above the top of the branch. This test would be in addition to
any testing performed by the applicable plumbing inspector.

      (1)   The JSA shall require significant industrial users to provide and
operate, at the user’s own expense, monitoring facilities and equipment
necessary to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building
sewer and/or internal drainage system. The monitoring facility should normally
be situated on the user’s premises, but the JSA may, when such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in a public right-of-way. The Executive Director or his or her
designee shall review and approve the location, plans and specifications for
such monitoring facilities and may require them to be constructed to provide
for the separate monitoring and sampling of industrial waste and sanitary
sewage flows.
         (a)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility shall be designed and maintained in a manner such that the safety
of JSA and user personnel shall be the foremost concern. The facility, sampling
and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a proper operating
condition at the expense of the user.
         (b)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the JSA’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
approval of the location, plans and specifications.
      (2)   Any sampling analysis done in accordance with approved federal EPA
procedures by the industrial user during a reporting period shall be submitted
to the Executive Director or his or her designee, regardless of whether or not
that analysis was required by the industrial user’s discharge permit.
      (3)   The industrial user must receive the approval of the Executive
Director before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring faculties to be
used in all required sampling.
   (L)   Pretreatment. All significant industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this subchapter and achieve
compliance with any applicable categorical pretreatment standards within the
time limitations as specified by the categorical pretreatment standards. The
JSA may require the development of a compliance schedule for installation of
pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any significant industrial user
that cannot meet discharge limits required by this subchapter. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level required by this subchapter shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing
the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
JSA for review, and shall be acceptable to the JSA before construction of the
facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an effluent that complies with the provisions of this subchapter.
Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation
shall be reported and acceptable to the JSA prior to the user’s initiation of
the changes.

ensure compliance with this subchapter, and as permitted through 40 C.F.R.
subchapter N, and 401 KAR 5:055, may take the following enforcement steps
against users in noncompliance with the ordinance. The remedies available to

discontinuance of wastewater treatment service, and the publishing of the list
of significant violators annually.
      (2)   The JSA may suspend wastewater treatment service and/or a discharge
permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Executive
Director or his or her designee, in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to
the POTW, or causes the JSA to violate any condition of its KPDES permit.
      (3)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the JSA shall take such: steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The JSA shall
reinstate the discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon

statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be
submitted to the Executive Director or his or her designee within 15 days of
the date of occurrence.
   (B)   Notice of violation. Any user found to be violating any provisions of
this subchapter, any permit, or any order issued hereunder, shall be served by
the JSA with written notice stating the nature of the violation(s). The NOV
requires the user to evaluate and explain the cause of the violation, states
actions to be taken to achieve compliance, and required steps to be taken to
ensure the violation will not reoccur. The NOV requires the user to return to
compliance and may state conditions or requirements for achieving compliance.
The NOV may also state deadlines for a response demonstrating compliance has
been achieved. Within ten days of the receipt date of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to
the Executive Director or his or her designee. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of potential liability for any violation occurring before
or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The Executive Director or his or her designee may issue to any user
who causes or contributes to violations of this subchapter, any permit or any

may be issued.
   (D)   Administrative orders. An administrative order may take any of the
following three forms.
      (1)   Consent orders. A negotiated settlement between the JSA and a user
found to be in noncompliance with this subchapter. The consent order differs
from the other forms of administrative orders in that the signatures of both
the JSA and user representative are required. The consent order may also
contain a compliance schedule (general reporting requirement, compliance
schedule) for meeting progress milestones dates and possibly fines or remedial
actions.
      (2)   Show cause orders. An order to direct the user to appear before the
JSA, explain its noncompliance, and show cause why more severe enforcement
actions against the user should not be taken. Show cause maybe used in
circumstances where previous enforcement actions have failed to resolve the
noncompliance. This could lead to further enforcement actions.
      (3)   Cease and desist orders. When the Executive Director finds that a
user has violated or continues to violate this subchapter or any permit or
order issued hereunder, the Executive Director or his or her designee may issue
an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in
noncompliance to: comply forthwith; or take such appropriate remedial or
preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or
threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the
discharge.
   (E)   Emergency suspension.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the JSA may suspend wastewater
treatment service and/or any permit immediately whenever such suspension is
necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or
causing any of the following conditions:

of persons or the environment;
         (b)   An interference or pass-through; and/or
         (c)   A violation of any condition of the JSA’s KPDES permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of wastewater treatment service
and/or any permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. A
hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension to determine

event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order,
the JSA shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer’s connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer
system or endangerment to any individuals. The JSA shall reinstate the
wastewater treatment service and permit upon proof of the elimination of the
noncompliance.
      (3)   Prior to the hearing described in division (E)(2) above, the user
shall submit, to the Executive Director or his or her designee, a detailed
written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence.
   (F)   Additional enforcement remedies.

91.02   Miscellaneous provisions
   
91.03   Interpretation
   
91.04   Non-exclusive cable television franchise provisions
§ 91.01 SUBSCRIBER RATES, CHARGES AND REFUNDS.
   (A)   Rates subject to regulation by the county. Rates subject to regulation
by the county include rates for the basic cable television service plus the
leased equipment necessary for the rendition of basic service (including
converter boxes, remote control units and wiring) and installation and extra
set charges.
   (B)   Rate changes and discrimination.
      (1)   Unless approved by the county and to the extent consistent with
federal law, no franchisee may in its rates or charges, or in the availability
of the services or facilities of its system, or in any other respect, make or
grant undue preferences or advantages to any subscriber or potential subscriber
to the system, including preferences based on the geographic location of the
subscriber, or to any user or potential user of the system, nor subject any
such persons to any undue prejudice or any disadvantage. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a franchisee may afford reasonable discounts for senior citizens and
other economically disadvantaged groups.
      (2)   Rates may be changed by the franchisee following a minimum 30 days’
prior notice to the county and the subscribers.
   (C)   Rate regulation.
      (1)   Upon certification of the county by the FCC to institute rate
regulation, the following procedures shall apply to those rates that are
subject to local regulation.
         (a)   When the county, on recommendation from the County Cable
Communications Authority, desires to initially review the basic service rates
and other rates subject to local regulation under federal law, it shall notify
the franchisee to file its schedule or rates with the County Cable
Communications Authority within 30 days of the receipt of such notice, together
with the data and information necessary to determine whether the rates meet the
FCC rate standards. Such supporting information shall include, at minimum, the
completed worksheets of FCC Form 393 and all relevant supporting information
and notes.
         (b)   When the franchisee desires to increase rates subsequent to the
initial rate review, it shall submit to the County Cable Communications
Authority the revised rate schedule, together with data and supporting
information necessary to determine whether the new rates meet the FCC rate
standards. Before filing for such rate increases, the franchisee shall give
notice to its subscribers as required herein, and by FCC rules.
         (c)   If the County Cable Communications Authority finds that the
rates submitted by the franchisee are consistent with FCC rate standards
following the procedure specified below, it shall so notify the franchisee
within 30 days of the filing of the rates, and any rate increases will become
effective on the thirty-first day after their filing. If the Authority cannot
find the rates are reasonable under the FCC standards within the 30-day period,
it shall so notify the franchisee and may issue a brief order postponing the
effectiveness of any rate increases for up to an additional 90 days; provided,
however, if the franchisee is depending on a cost of service study to
demonstrate reasonableness, the Authority may postpone the effectiveness of any
rate increase for up to an additional 150 days.
      (2)   Members of the public and other interested parties may file written
comments with the County Cable Communications Authority within 14 days of the
date a franchisee files its rates for initial review or for review of a rate
increase. The Authority shall schedule a public hearing on rates before it for
review following appropriate advance announcement to the public and the
franchisee. The hearing may be before the County Fiscal Court, or it may
delegate the Authority to take public testimony and report to the Fiscal Court.
Whenever the Fiscal Court disapproves rates or rate increases, in whole or in
part, or approves rates over the objections of interested parties, it shall do
so by written order explaining its reasons and provide public notice thereof.
   (D)   Remedies. Whenever the Fiscal Court disapproves a schedule of rates
upon initial review or subsequent rate increases, it may employ any combination
of the following remedies.
      (1)   A prospective reduction in rates may be ordered consistent with FCC
rate standards or the results of a cost of service study.
      (2)   New rates may be prescribed by the city, upon recommendation of the
County Cable Communications Authority, to bring rates found to be unreasonable
into compliance with FCC rate standards or a cost of service study.
      (3)   Upon recommendation of the County Cable Communications Authority,
the county may, consistent with division (D)(4) below, order the franchisee to
refund to subscribers an amount by which rates are found to be unreasonable
under any of the following circumstances:
         (a)   As part of the initial review of rates;
         (b)   When the franchisee has failed to comply with a rate decision
and has continued to charge unreasonable rates; or
         (c)   Where the county has tolled a prospective rate increase for 90
to 150 additional days (as applicable) and the rate increase later found to be
unreasonable has gone into effect.
      (4)   When refunds may become applicable under division (D)(3) above, the
county shall issue a brief order when the tolled rates go into effect directing
the franchisee to keep accurate account of all amounts paid by individual
subscribers relative to the rates in question (an “accounting order”). The
period for which refunds may be ordered shall not exceed one year or extend
back in time before September 1, 1993, whichever period is less. Before
ordering a refund, the county must give the franchisee prior notice and an
opportunity to make a presentation, either orally in a hearing context or by
paper filings. Refunds shall include interest computed at the rate used by the
Internal Revenue Service for refunds and additional tax payments. Normally,
refunds shall be made to individual subscribers that paid the unreasonable
charges; however, where no accounting order has been issued or the franchisee
can demonstrate that such specific refunds will entail undue burden compared
with the amount of the refund, the county may authorize a one-time credit to
all subscribers of the class that paid the unreasonable rates.
   (E)   Conflicts and interpretations. If any provision in this section shall
be determined to be in conflict with a rule, regulation, policy or order of the
FCC, then in that circumstance the FCC requirement shall take precedence over
the requirement of this section. If any requirement of this section shall have
ambiguity in interpretation or in applicability, it shall be interpreted in a
way that is consistent with FCC rules, requirements and opinions.
(Ord. 94-2, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 91.02 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   In connection with the county’s regulation of cable rates under §
91.01, the Cable Authority shall be delegated the authority to perform the

the rate regulation and receive all notice and filings from the franchisee
relative to such regulation;

additional information from the franchisee as necessary, and, where
appropriate, issue orders tolling the effectiveness of rate increases and/or

rates subject to county regulation, and subsequent changes to such rates, and

(Ord. 97-5, passed 11-19-1997)
§ 92.04 FINANCIAL ASSURANCE.
   (A)   No person as defined herein shall operate a confined hog facility
without providing to the Fiscal Court financial assurance as herein required.
The owner or operator must submit a detailed written estimate, in current
dollars, of the cost to clean up the natural resources which could be
contaminated, polluted, defiled or soiled by leaks or spills from the manure
storage structures including lagoons which are part of the facility. The owner
or operator must annually adjust the cost estimate for inflation using the U.S.
Consumers Price Index for rural areas.
   (B)   The cost estimate shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Cost of clean-up of above-ground facilities. The clean-up of above
ground facilities and manure shall be calculated by determining the costs of a
third party:
         (a)   Disposing of all manure stored on-site at an identified site;
and
         (b)   Cleaning or removing all above ground structures. For purposes
of this calculation, it is assumed that the manure storage container is 100%
full. The estimate submitted shall be certified by a registered engineer and
shall set out how the cost was determined.
      (2)   Cost of remediation of off-site contamination. The costs of
remediation of off-site contamination shall be calculated by multiplying the
animal weight capacity of the operation by $2 for those facilities which store
manure in earthen manure storage basins; by $1 for those facilities which store
manure in anaerobic lagoons; and by $0.50 for those facilities which store
manure in formed manure storage structures.
      (3)   Credit for maintaining wells. 
         (a)   The financial assurance amount for a facility that has installed
groundwater monitoring wells with at least one well located upgradient, and two
wells located downgradient from the manure lagoon, basin or structure shall be
reduced by 50% provided the test results are submitted to the Fiscal Court
annually and reveal no groundwater contamination.
         (b)   Using EPA approved methods and procedures for chemical analysis,
each water sample drawn shall be tested for the following chemical
constituents:
            1.   pH;
            2.   Conductivity;
            3.   Total dissolved solids;
            4.   Temperature;
            5.   Total alkalinity;
            6.   Chemical oxygen demand;
            7.   Ammonia-nitrogen;
            8.   Total Kjeldahl nitrogen;
            9.   Sulfate;
            10.   Chloride;
            11.   Total organic carbon;
            12.   Sodium; and
            13.   Nitrate-nitrogen.
         (c)   If appropriate, the facility may substitute Vadose Zone
monitoring devices for groundwater monitoring wells, subject to the approval of
the Cabinet for Natural Resources and Environmental Protection.
      (4)   Amount of financial assurance required. 
         (a)   The cost determined under divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) above and
the credit, if any, under division (B)(3) above shall be added together and the
sum shall be the financial assurance amount required under the provisions of
this section.
         (b)   The mechanisms used to demonstrate financial assurance must
insure that the funds necessary to meet the costs of clean-up and remediation
will be available if needed. In establishing financial assurance, owners and
operators must choose from the following options:
            1.   A facility may obtain a payment or performance surety bond.
The bond must be effective before the initial receipt of hogs into the
facility, and a copy filed with the Fiscal Court. The surety company issuing
the bond must, at a minimum, be as acceptable sureties on Federal Bonds and
Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In addition, the bond
shall:
               a.   Be in an amount at least equal to the cost estimates
established above;
               b.   Provide that the surety will become liable under the bond
if the facility fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond; and
               c.   Provide that the surety may cancel the bond by sending
notice of cancellation by certified mail to the facility and Fiscal Court 120

financial assurance or cease operations.

of the policy must be filed with the Fiscal Court and shall provide:
               a.   All funds will be available for any on- or off-site clean-
up resulting from the operation. The policy must guarantee that the insurer
will be responsible for: paying out funds to the facility or others authorized

the policy to a successor facility. Said assignment may be conditional upon
consent of the insurer, provided that such consignment is not unreasonably
refused; and
               d.   The policy must provide that the insurer may not cancel,
terminate or fail to renew the policy except for failure to pay the premium.
The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a minimum, provide the insurer
with the option of renewal at the face amount of the expiring policy. If there
is a failure to pay the premium, the insurer may cancel the policy by sending
notice of cancellation by certified mail to the facility and Fiscal Court 120
days before the cancellation. If the insurer cancels the policy, the facility
must obtain alternate financial assurance or cease operation.
            3.   A facility may demonstrate financial assurance by deposits
with the Fiscal Court of unsubordinated debentures, U.S. government bonds or
notes, or certificates of deposit issued by federal or state chartered banks
with a market value equal to or exceeding the sum of the financial assurance
requirement. Said financial instruments shall beheld by the Fiscal Court for so
long as the provisions of this chapter apply and may not be otherwise pledged
by the facility. Interest payments, if any, from the financial instruments
pledged as security shall be paid to the owner.

§ 95.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate massage
establishments in order to promote the health, safety and general welfare of
the citizens of the county, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations
relating to massage establishments.
   (B)   Findings.
      (1)   Since the operation of a massage establishment primarily involves
the physical manipulation of body parts, the actual business facility, the
manner, and the time frame in which the business is operated present important
public interest issues.
      (2)   The operation of a massage establishment requires compliance with
local and state health regulations.
      (3)   In the operation of massage establishments, equipment may be used
to perform certain manipulations on patrons. Therefore, the cleanliness and
safety of the equipment and its operation presents an important public interest
issue.
      (4)   The operation of a massage establishment requires physical contact
between the employee and patrons. Hence, it is desirable in order to prevent
the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information
regarding employees.
      (5)   The City of Paducah, located within the geographical boundaries of
the county, has in place a city ordinance dealing with the licensing and
regulation of massage establishments and their employees.
      (6)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism by
which to regulate massage establishments and their employees.

§ 96.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety and general welfare
of the citizens of the county, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations relating to sexually oriented businesses. The provisions of this
chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter
to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected
by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in reports made available to the
Fiscal Court, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v.
Play Time Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young vs. American Mini Theaters,
426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and
on studies in other communities, including, but not limited to, Phoenix,
Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier,
California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the report of
the Attorney General’s Working Group on the regulation of sexually oriented
businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Fiscal Court finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises;
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented business defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments;
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicals for viewing films, videos or live sex shows;
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities which
creates unhealthy conditions;
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses;
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, non-A, non-13 amebiasis, salmonella infections and
shigella infections;
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. Through December 31, 1997,
there have been 619,690 reported cases of AIDS in the United States;
      (8)   As of December 31, 1997, there have been 2,583 reported cases of
AIDS in the commonwealth;
      (9)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn;
      (10)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts;
      (11)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities
and maintain those facilities;
      (12)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented
films;
      (13)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(12) above raise
substantial governmental concerns;
      (14)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns;
      (15)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters;
and
      (16)   The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the
county will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
(Ord. 2000-4, passed 4-24-2000)

SITING PROCEDURES
   Given the lack of critical need for additional final disposal capacity in
McCracken County, it is unlikely that the need for detailed solid waste
facility siting criteria will be required for some time to come. However, the
need may well arise in the foreseeable future to consider the issues associated
with siting facilities such as a material recovery facility, refuse derived
fuel facility or a composting center at some location other than the CWI
Transfer Station. In any event, the McCracken County Fiscal Court and the
McCracken County Planning Commission should be prepared to consider facility
siting criteria in the event a municipal or private entity should choose to
develop a final disposal facility within McCracken County.
   The solid waste management facility siting evaluation matrix for McCracken
County was designed to be sufficiently general so that it could be used as a
siting evaluation with a wide range of waste management facility types. The
siting evaluation matrix includes numerous evaluation criteria which the
McCracken County Fiscal Court considers to be important considerations during
the siting of any solid waste management facility. However some of these
criteria might be more applicable to the siting of a landfill while others
would probably be of greater importance during the siting of less intensive
facilities such as a transfer station or a convenience center. It is for this
reason that this matrix includes the provision for weighting each criterion
based on the relative importance of that particular criterion in the opinion of
the reviewers.
   The use of this evaluation matrix is quite simple although it is not
perfectly objective. The reviewers must first make a decision as to the
relative significance of the various evaluations criteria based upon the type
of facility under consideration. The site(s) under consideration are then
evaluated using the described evaluation guidelines and a points score is
applied within each evaluation category for each site under consideration. The
final score within each evaluation criteria is determined by multiplying the
criterion weighting by the points assigned under the evaluation guidelines. All
evaluation criteria final scores are then summed to determine the total site
score. If more than one site is being evaluated, the relative scoring of each
site makes selection relatively straightforward. If a single site is being
evaluated then the reviewing group must determine the break point between what
constitutes an acceptable site versus an unacceptable site. Generally, however,
the reviewing group might wish to look very critically at a site which receives
less than one-half of the total points possible given the selected criteria
weighting schema.

of the permit, including but not limited to the application, design
requirements, and improvement bonds shall be done in a manner specified by the
Zoning Administrator.
(Ord. 2017-07, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 150.032 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Continuation generally. The lawful use of a building or land existing
at the time of the adoption of these zoning regulations and amendments hereto
may be continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions of the
adopted zoning regulations, except as otherwise provided herein.
   (B)   Specific standards.
      (1)   A nonconforming use or structure existing at the time of the
adoption of these zoning regulations, which was conforming at the time of its
erection, may be continued in use, although such use does not conform to the
provisions of such regulations.
      (2)   With the formal authorization of the Board of Adjustment, granted
after a duly advertised public hearing and after its determination that the
properties in the general vicinity will not be adversely affected by the
change, an existing nonconforming use may be changed to a new nonconforming use
in the same or a more restrictive zone classification.
      (3)   The Board of Adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or
extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at
the time the regulation, which makes its use nonconforming, was adopted. Any
proposal for an enlargement or extension of a structure or building which does
not enlarge the scope or the operation shall appear before the Board of
Adjustment, which may be granted after a public hearing.
      (4)   A building or structure, which is the subject of a nonconforming
use, may be maintained and repaired.
      (5)   A building or structure which does not comply with the dimensional
requirements of the zoning regulations may be maintained, repaired, altered, or
moved, provided that every portion so enlarged or moved shall be made to
conform to all the regulations of the zone in which the structure is located.
      (6)   A building or structure which is nonconforming, either with respect
to its use or with respect to dimensional requirements on the lot where it is
situated, which is damaged or destroyed by any cause to the extent of more than
75% of its value or area, shall not be repaired nor rebuilt, except in
conformance with the provisions of the zoning regulations.
      (7)   On any lot where there is an existing principal structure which was
conforming at the time it was constructed, but which had become nonconforming
with respect to front, rear, or side yard requirements, and which otherwise
complies with the use and dimensional requirements of the zoning regulations,
an addition to that structure may be constructed which similarly does not
conform to the front, rear or side yard requirements; provided the newly
created nonconform is no nearer to the front, side, or rear lot line than the
previously nonconforming existing structure.
(Ord. 2017-07, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 150.033 LOTS.
   (A)   Multiple principal buildings. In a UR zone, only one principal
structure and its customary accessory structures may hereafter be erected on
any one lot. Agriculture uses, regardless of zone, are exempt from this
requirement. In a UR zone, the Planning Commission, with an approved
development plan, may authorize multiple principal buildings but one
residential dwelling unit may be added without a development plan if there is
at least 12,000 square feet of lot area per dwelling unit. In AG, RR, C, ML,
and MH zones, multiple principal buildings are allowed.
   (B)   Front yard setback lines. Front yard setback lines may be varied where
the average depth of principal buildings of adjoining properties is less than
the depth as prescribed by the zoning regulations. In such case, the front yard
in question shall not be less than the average depth of existing front yards on
the two lots immediately adjoining. If the adjoining lots are vacant, then
nearest structures in the district may be considered.
   (C)   Zero lot lines. The purpose of this zero lot line regulation is to
allow multiple single-family attached residential structures to be built across
one or more side lot lines. Structures shall be constructed on the interior
side lot lines, having a separate unit on each of the lots, and a side yard
setback shall be provided on each end of the structure. Setback lines apply to
the structure as a whole, not individual units, allowing individual units in a
single building to each be an individual parcel. The structure as a whole is
required to meet front, rear, and side yard setbacks and total area
requirements.

§ 150.034 CONDITIONAL USES.
   Conditional uses are allowed only by specific approval of the Board of
Adjustment and only in the zone in which they are listed.
   (A)   Application and review procedure. The Board shall grant the
conditional use following a public hearing and upon an affirmative finding by
the Board that:
      (1)   The proposed conditional use is to be located in a zone wherein
such use may be permitted; and
      (2)   The conditional use is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the zoning regulations, will not substantially and permanently injure
the appropriate use of neighboring property, and will serve the public
convenience and welfare.
   (B)   The Board of Adjustment may approve or deny any applications for a
conditional use permit. If it approves the issuance of a conditional use
permit, it may attach conditions to the approval such as time limitations,
requirements that one or more things be done before construction can be
initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature. Any such condition shall be
recorded in the Board’s minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a
reference to the specific section of the zoning regulations, or any other
applicable ordinance of the county listing the conditional use under
consideration.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to revoke conditional use
permits for noncompliance with the conditions thereof. Furthermore, the Board
shall have the right of action to compel offending structures or uses to be
removed at the cost of the violator and may have judgment against that person
for such cost.
   (D)   The conditional use permits approved by the Board of Adjustment shall
be recorded at the expense of the applicant in the office of the County Clerk.
   (E)   Approval of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant
from complying with all requirements of building, housing, and other codes and
regulations of the county.
   (F)   In any case in which a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within one year from its date of issuance, such conditional use many revert to
its original zoning designation following a public hearing held by the Board of
Adjustment in accordance with KRS Chapter 424. “Exercised,” as set forth in
this division, shall mean that binding contracts for the construction of the
main building or other improvements have been let or, in the absence of
contracts, that the principal building or other improvements are under
construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving
substantial investment are under contract, in development, or complete. When
construction is not a part of the use, “exercised” shall mean that the user is
operating in compliance with the conditions as designated in the permit.
   (G)   The Administrative Official shall review all conditional use permits,
except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least
once each year. The enforcement office shall have the power to inspect the land
or structure where the special use is located in order to determine if the
landowner is complying with all of the conditions, which are listed on the
conditional use permit.
   (H)   If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on
the conditional use permit, the enforcement officer shall report this fact in
writing to the chairperson of the Board of Adjustment. The report of the
enforcement officer shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner
or occupant is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit.
A copy of this report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time (as
nearly as is possible) it is furnished to the chairperson of the Board. The
Board shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time, and notice
of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner and/or
occupant at least one week prior to the hearing.
   (I)   If the Board of Adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the report
of the enforcement officer are true, and that the landowner and/or occupant has
taken no action to comply with the conditions (as originally placed on the
permit) between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, the Board
may authorize the Administrative Official to revoke the conditional use permit
and take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity on
the land which the conditional use permit authorizes.
   (J)   Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional use permit
and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely
and permanently satisfied, the Administrative Official, upon request by the
applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions
have been satisfied and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions have
been satisfied and the conclusions in the margin of the copy of the conditional
use permit which is on file with the County Clerk; thereafter the use in
question, if it continues to meet the other requirements of the zoning
regulations, will be considered a permitted use.

§ 150.037 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT USE AND ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   Intent and purpose. In order to prevent crime, protect the county's
retail trade, maintain property values, and generally to protect and preserve
the quality of its neighborhoods, commercial districts, and the quality of
life, this chapter regulates the location of adult entertainment establishments
by dispersing them throughout the county. In the development and execution of
this section, it is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their
very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under
certain circumstances thereby having a deleterious effect upon the use and
enjoyment of adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to
insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or
downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are
itemized in this section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose
of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area. Wherever there are
other county regulations, the stricter of the regulation applies. Uses subject
to these controls are as follows in this section.

convert solar energy into electric energy.
   (B)   Levels of SES.
      (1)   Level 1. Systems designed to provide power to the structures on a
parcel. Level 1 systems include roof mounted systems (such as, but not limited
to panels, solar shingles, and the like) and ground mounted systems larger than
60 square feet but covering less than one-half acre. Level 1 systems are
considered accessory structures; and
      (2)   Level 2. Ground mounted systems greater than one-half acre or
greater in size for the commercial production of electricity and transmission
to a public utility.
   (C)   Conditional use.
      (1)   Level 2 SES are a conditional use in the AG Zone. Level 2 SES are
not permitted in RR, UR, C, ML, or MH Zones. Any Level 2 SES proposal must also
agree with the county’s adopted future land use plan for areas designated as
Agricultural. Any application that does not agree with the future land use plan
shall be rejected by the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   Level 1 SES are permitted in all zones.
   (D)   Setbacks.
      (1)   Level 1 SES which are ground mounted are not permitted in front or
side yards. In rear yards, ground mounted systems shall be a minimum of 50 feet
from any principal structure on an adjoining property.
      (2)   Level 2 SES are required to be setback 150 feet from all exterior
property lines, and shall not be placed closer than 500 feet to any existing or
permitted residential structure intended for human occupancy. SES that extends
across multiple parcels do not have to follow setback requirements (zero lot
lines) for interior property lines located within the security fencing.
   (E)   Screening.
      (1)   All previously existing perimeter tree lines shall be left in place
to serve as a visual buffer. Where tree lines do not exist or are removed, a
natural screen of a double row of staggered evergreens (minimum eight-foot
height at planting and maturing to a minimum of 15 feet tall) planted 15 feet
on center from any public right-of-way or adjacent residential use shall be
used. Screening shall remain 90% visually solid year-round. Screenings shall be
located a minimum of 50 feet from property lines. Visual buffers shall be
placed on the exterior of the security fence.
      (2)   Level 1 SES are exempt from screening requirements excluding ground
mounted systems which shall be screened from adjacent residential uses located
within 200 feet of the ground mounted system. Screening shall be a six-foot
high fence that is 90% visually solid or six-foot tall shrubs and/or evergreen
trees that remain 90% visually solid year-round.
   (F)   Security fencing. A security fence shall surround all Level 2 SES and
be at least seven feet tall or six feet tall with three strands of barbed wire.
Level 1 SES are exempt from security fencing requirements.
   (G)   Signage. There shall be no signs permitted except those displaying
emergency information, owner contact information, warning or safety
instructions or signs that are required by a federal, state or local agency.
Such signs shall not exceed five square feet in area.
   (H)   Ground maintenance. Topsoil shall not be removed. Grasses shall be
maintained or established. Herbicides and ground sterilant and gravel shall not
be used as a method of vegetative control, except around fences. Grasses inside
and outside the security fence shall not exceed ten inches tall. The Board of
Adjustment may waive this requirement if the developer can show this
requirement will create an undue burden and an acceptable ground maintenance
plan is submitted with the conditional use permit application.
   (I)   Stormwater management. For Level 2 SES stormwater and erosion control
plans per §
150.085 must be submitted with the site plan and approved prior to construction
or clearing.
   (J)   Decommissioning.
      (1)   A decommissioning plan shall be prepared by a licensed engineer and
updated every five years. The decommissioning plan must be subnmitted and
approved with the site plan. The plan shall establish the party responsible for
decommissioning, the anticipated life of the project, the estimated
decommissioning cost including removal of all structures, facilities,
equipment, fencing, conduit, driveways and the estimated salvage value of such.
Decommissioning must begin no later than 12 months after a solar farm has
substantially ceased to generate electricity for a period of three months. All
structures, facilities, and equipment must then be removed from the property
within six months and any disturbed areas for the property reclaimed,
revegetated, and otherwise restored in a manner consistent with its prior
state. A copy of all leases containing language regarding decommissioning must
also be approved by the county.
      (2)   A performance bond, or other approvable financial surety, payable
to McCracken County Fiscal Court sufficient to cover 110% of the net cost of
decommissioning of the site by a third party in the event the assigned party
defaults on this obligation. The amount shall be evaluated every five years in
conjunction with the revision to the decommissioning plan by a third-party
engineer at the expense of the developer, or SES owner, and requires final
approval by the Fiscal Court.
   (K)   Fees. Site plan review fees are $10 per acre in addition to the
conditional use application fee for any application and due at the time of
application.

      (3)   Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged by the applicant that there is an error in any order, requirement,
permit, decision, grant, determination, or refusal made by the enforcement
officer or other administrative office in the carrying out of this chapter, and
for interpretation of the zoning map. The Board of Adjustment has authority to
said appeals, and to make literal interpretations of the pertinent provisions
in order to correct any possible misinterpretation, and to make only those
departures from a literal conformance of the zoning regulations, which are
specifically delegated to it;
      (4)   Procedures for all appeals to Board. Appeals to the Board may be
taken by any person or entity claiming to be injuriously affected or aggrieved
by an official action, order requirement, interpretation, grant, refusal, or
decision of any zoning administrative or enforcement officer. Such appeal shall
be taken within 30 days of a decision by the official, by filing with said
officer and with the Board a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof,
and giving notice of such appeal to any and parties of records. Said officer
shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed form was taken and shall be treated as and be the
respondent in such further proceedings. At the public hearing on the appeal
held by the Board, any interested person may appear and enter his or her
appearance, and all shall be given an opportunity to be heard;
      (5)   Public notice of appeal hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable
time for hearing the appeal and give public notice in accordance with KRS
Chapter 424, as well as written notice to the appellant and the Administrative
Official at least one week prior to the hearing, and shall decide it within 60
days. The affected party may appear at the hearing in person or by attorney;
      (6)   Variance. To hear and decide on applications for dimensional
variance where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or unusual
shape of the site, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or some
other extraordinary situation or condition of that site, the literal
enforcement of the dimensional requirements of the zoning provisions would
deprive the applicant of reasonable capacity to make use of the land in a
manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone. The
Board may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions it decides to grant.
The Board shall deny any request for a variance arising from circumstances that
are the result of willful violations of the zoning regulation by the applicant
subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation form which relief is
sought;
      (7)   Findings necessary for granting variances. Before any variance is
granted, the Board must find that the granting of the variance will not
adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare, will not alter the
essential character of the general vicinity, will not cause a hazard of
nuisance to the public, and will not allow an unreasonable circumvent of the
requirements of the zoning regulation. In making these finding, the Board shall
consider whether:
         (a)   The requested variance arises from special circumstances, which
do not generally apply, to land in the general vicinity, or in the same zone;
         (b)   The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an
unnecessary hardship on the applicant; and
         (c)   The circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant
subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is
sought.
      (8)   Nonconforming use change. To permit a change from one nonconforming
use to another, providing the new nonconforming use is in the same or a more
restrictive zoning classification in accordance with these zoning regulations;
      (9)   Limits of authority. The Board of Adjustment shall not possess the
power to grant a variance to permit a use of any land, building, or structure,
which is not permitted by the zoning provisions for the zone in question; or to
alter density requirements in the zone in question. The Board does not possess
the authority to permit a use not authorized by these zoning regulations;
      (10)   Application of variance. A dimensional variance applies to the
property for which it is granted, and not the applicant. A variance also runs
with the land, and is transferable to any landowner of the land, but the
applicant cannot transfer it to a different site;
      (11)   Additional authority. In granting a variance, the Board may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features
of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable in the
furtherance of the purposes of these zoning regulations;
      (12)   Report. A written report on each variance that is granted or
denied by the Board shall be submitted to the County Fiscal Court with a copy
retained in the files of the planning office; and
      (13)   Members. The Board of Adjustment shall consist of five members.

§ 150.108 ADMINISTRATIVE JURISDICTION.
   (A)   The county may employ a staff or contract with planners or other
persons, as it deems necessary to accomplish its assigned duties as delineated
in KRS Chapter 100. The administrative and enforcement officer has initial
authority for the literal enforcement of these zoning regulations. They have no
discretionary authority to allow any departure from the literal conformance
with the zoning regulations.
   (B)   The Circuit Court has jurisdiction to determine all questions and
issues properly brought before it on appeal from the decisions of the Board of
Adjustment or Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2017-07, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 150.109 AMENDMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of this section is to provide guidance for the
zoning ordinance amendment processes, including text and map amendments. It
shall also be the intent of this section to guide the use of development plans,
which may be used for a variety of planning and zoning processes, including map
amendments. The Planning Commission in its obligation to promote the public
health, safety, and general well-being shall consider, but not be limited to,
the following in its amendatory and development plan considerations:
      (1)   The conservation of natural resources, which may include various
wildlife forms, vegetation, steep slopes, surface water, ground water,
floodplain, soils, geologically sensitive areas, air quality, noise, sufficient
sunlight exposure, and the like;
      (2)   The conservation of sites that have historic or architectural
value;
      (3)   The provision for safe, efficient vehicular and pedestrian
transportation, off-street parking and loading within the development and the
community and neighborhood;
      (4)   The provision for sufficient open space and recreational
opportunities;
      (5)   The compatibility of the overall site design (buildings, parking,
circulation, signs, screening, and landscaping) and land use with the existing
and projected future land use of the area;
      (6)   The provision for adequate drainage facilities to prevent runoff
problems during times of peak precipitation and flooding to the site and the
surrounding community/neighborhood;
      (7)   The provision that infrastructure needs shall, as they relate to
essential services and infrastructure systems, be adequately addressed;
      (8)   The development plan’s compliance with the comprehensive plan and
all applicable regulations as per county subdivision regulations.
   (B)   Initiation and actions required for amendment. This chapter, including
both the text and the zoning map, may be amended, supplemented, changed,
modified, or repealed. A proposal for amendment to any zoning regulation may
originate with the Planning Commission or with the Fiscal Court, or with the
owner of the property in question for map amendments. Regardless of the origin
of the proposed amendment, it shall be referred to the Planning Commission
before adoption.
   (C)   Public notice of proposed amendments.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall then hold at least one public hearing
after notice as required by KRS Chs. 100 and 424. The Planning Commission shall
send copies of the notice to adjoining property owners surrounding the proposed
zoning change within 200 feet of the property proposed for a map amendment.
      (2)   All procedures for public notice and publication as well as for
adoption shall be the same as for the original enactment of a zoning ordinance
(KRS Ch. 424).
   (D)   Findings required for granting amendment. Before any map amendment is
granted, the Planning Commission must find that the map amendment is in
agreement with the comprehensive plan, or, in the absence of such a finding,
that one or more of the following apply, and such findings shall be recorded in
the minutes and records of the Planning Commission:
      (1)   That the existing zoning classification given to the property is
inappropriate and that the proposed zoning classification is appropriate;
      (2)   That there have been major changes of an economic, physical, or
social nature within the area involved which were not anticipated in the
comprehensive plan and which have substantially altered the basic character of
the area.
   (E)   Variances and conditional use permits. The Planning Commission may
hear and finally decide applications for variances or conditional use permits
when a proposed development plan requires a map amendment and one or more
variances or conditional use permits. The Planning Commission shall assume all
powers and duties otherwise exercised by the Board of Adjustment pursuant to
KRS Ch. 100 and this chapter. The applicant for the map amendment may elect to
have any variances or conditional use permits for the same development to be
heard and finally decided by the Planning Commission at the same public hearing
set for the map amendment, or by the Board of Adjustment as otherwise provided
for by KRS Ch. 100 and this chapter.
   (F)   Development plan requirements.
      (1)   When required. A preliminary development plan shall be required in
the following instances:
         (a)   The Planning Commission, as a condition to the granting of any
zoning change, shall require the submission of a development plan which, where
agreed upon, shall be followed; except for a single principal structure and
accessory structures for a single family dwelling, a duplex dwelling, a triplex
dwelling, or a four-plex dwelling on a single lot or ownership parcel. As a
further condition to the granting of a zoning change, the Planning Commission
shall require that substantial construction be initiated within two years
following the enactment of the map amendment, provided that such zoning change
shall not revert to its original designation unless there has been a public
hearing. The development plan shall be a continuing condition for the area
rezoned unless amended as required herein;
         (b)   When there is a proposal for multiple principal buildings on a
single ownership parcel or lot;
         (c)   The subdivision process may substitute for the development plan
process.
      (2)   Plans defined. For purposes of this division (F) and the plans
required herein, the following definitions shall apply:
         (a)   SKETCH PLAN. This plan will be used to determine the essential
graphic and written materials required for a specific map amendment and those
specific actions, such as map amendments, variances, or conditional use permits
that may be requested of the Planning Commission. The sketch plan may be
conceptual, but should indicate any site or surrounding features or conditions
that may affect the proposed development or surrounding properties or rights-
of-way, the proposed buildings, access points, parking and loading areas,
landscaping and screening areas, existing and proposed utilities, proposed
location for solid waste storage and access to same, and any other conditions
on the site or surrounding properties or proposed development features which
may affect the development of the site or surrounding properties or rights-of-
way. The sketch plan does not have to be detailed or highly finished drawings
but should address the issues and conditions that may be essential to the
development.
         (b)   PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN. This plan shall be that plan
adopted by the Planning Commission when the Planning Commission favorably
recommends a map amendment to the Fiscal Court. The preliminary development
plan shall include that information as determined in the pre-application
conference. No building permits shall be issued based upon a preliminary
development plan.
         (c)   FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. This plan is, in effect, a final site
plan with that level of detail as may be required for obtaining those permits
and approvals necessary for construction. It shall include all information
required as set forth hereinafter and as necessary for the review of the
proposed development and its compliance with any applicable law or regulation,
including any previously approved preliminary development plan.
      (3)   Content and format of development plans. All development plans
shall be prepared on mylar or other material capable of clear reproduction.
Required plan information shall be as follows:
         (a)   Contents of preliminary development plan. A preliminary

            3.   Date, appropriate north point, and graphic scale;
            4.   A vicinity, or key map, oriented in the same direction as the
design scheme, scale not smaller than one inch equals 2,000 feet;
            5.   Topography, with contours at an interval of not greater than
five feet. USGS quadrangles may be used as a base. This requirement may be
waived by the discretion of the County Engineer.
            6.   Scale of one hundred feet to one inch or larger;
            7.   Location, arrangement and approximate dimensions of existing
and proposed streets, roads, driveways, sidewalks, and parking areas. Profiles

            9.   Approximate size, location, floor area, and use of proposed
and existing buildings;
            10.   Approximate location of lot lines for projects anticipated to
involve land subdivision;
            11.   Approximate location and dimensions of all existing and
proposed easements;
            12.   Approximate location and sizes of existing and proposed
utilities;
            13.   Minimum building setback lines;
            14.   Floodplain as determined by Federal Emergency Management
Agency, (F.E.M.A.), and classification, as per F.E.M.A. codes;
            15.   Approximate location and dimensions of storm drainage areas,
conceptual drainage controls and stormwater retention;
            16.   Plats shall be submitted not larger than 24 by 36 inches in
size.
         (b)   Contents of final development plan. A final development plan
shall contain all information as required for preliminary development plans
under the provisions below, except that the plan information shall be of an
exact nature, rather than approximate or general.
   (G)   Map amendment and development plan procedures.
      (1)   Preapplication conference.
         (a)   Prior to any application for an amendment, the applicant shall
meet informally with county planning staff to determine the following:
            1.   The effect of the proposed development on the existing
neighborhood, traffic patterns, and infrastructure systems;
            2.   How the proposed development relates to the comprehensive
plan;
            3.   The various regulations that may apply to the proposed
development;
            4.   An explanation of the required contents of the preliminary
development plan, and any other required submission of materials; and
            5.   An explanation of the amendment process.
         (b)   At the time of the meeting with the planning staff, the
applicant should present a sketch plan, as outlined in division (F)(2)(a)
above.
      (2)   Formal application. To formally request the Commission to consider
action on any zone map amendment and/or preliminary development plan, the
applicant shall file a complete application (with respect to all applicable
provisions of this chapter and other county ordinances, regulations and
policies), pay the filing fee, and provide copies of all written and graphic
material as required. Also the date for the public hearing will be set.
      (3)   Refiling. Upon reenacted amendment proposals, the applicant must
wait one year before reapplying with the same proposal, unless the Planning
Commission grants permission to resubmit sooner.
      (4)   Review. The planning staff shall send the development plan to
concerned agencies and interests for their respective technical review. If
necessary, or requested by the applicant, the interest and technical review
bodies may meet together to resolve, if possible, all differences and
difficulties associated with the development proposal. These meetings will be
open to all interested parties, including the public.
      (5)   Zoning map amendment procedure.
         (a)   Proposed map amendments shall follow the alternative zoning map
amendment procedures set out in KRS 100.2111. The Planning Commission
recommendation relating to the proposed amendment shall become final and the
map amendment shall be automatically implemented subject to the provisions of
KRS 100.347, and as set forth in the Planning Commission recommendations,
unless within 21 days after final action by the Planning Commission:
            1.   Any aggrieved party that files a written request with the
Planning Commission that the final decision shall be made by the Fiscal Court;
or
            2.   The Fiscal Court files a notice with the Planning Commission
that the Fiscal Court shall decide the map amendment. It shall take a majority
of the entire Fiscal Court to override the recommendation of the Planning
Commission.
      (6)   Planning Commission action. No development plans will be considered
for Commission action until they have been reviewed by the appropriate review
agencies or interests. The Commission may pursue the following action:
         (a)   Approval. The development plan is ready for approval as
presented.
         (b)   Conditional approval. The development plan will be approved when
the developer has complied with the conditions of approval set forth in the
Commission’s action on the development plan.
         (c)   Disapproval. The development plan has been disapproved by the
Planning Commission. To request new review and action, the developer must file
a new application as set forth in this section.
         (d)   Postponement. In circumstances where further resolution is
required, the Commission may act to postpone final action on the development
plan until further information or resolution of conflicts can be ascertained in
accordance with KRS 100.211.
      (7)   Final development (site) plans procedures.
         (a)   Only after the Planning Commission has adopted the preliminary
development plan, the applicant must present a final development plan as set
forth in division (F)(2)(c) prior to the issuance of a building permit. County
staff will check the final development plan and ensure that:
            1.   The plan is in compliance with the preliminary development
plan.
            2.   The plan is in compliance with the comprehensive plan, this
chapter, other county ordinances, regulations or policies, and all other
applicable laws and regulations.
            3.   Where appropriate the review agencies may assess the document
and forward their comments to the county prior to final development plan
approval.
         (b)   If the final development plan complies with division (G)(7)(a)
above, the Planning Commission Chair will certify on the face of the plan that
all planning requirements and applicable conditions have been satisfied.
   (H)   Amendments to development plans. Amendments to approved development
plans can be made only by official Planning Commission action following a
public hearing. Content, format, and procedures shall be the same as for the
original submission. However, amendments, which fully meet the requirements set
forth hereinafter as minor amendments, shall be approved and certified by the
county without further action by the Planning Commission.
      (1)   Minor amendments defined. Minor amendments are intended to expedite
approval in those situations where amendments are of minor significance and
generally relate to the shifting of previously approved spaces. Such
amendments:
         (a)   Shall not decrease the overall land area in wards or other open
spaces;
         (b)   Shall not increase building ground area coverage, floor area, or
height, or increase the number of dwelling units;
         (c)   May increase building ground area coverage for accessory
buildings, or principal buildings if additions are less than 10% and additional
parking can be provided without disruption to major plan elements;
         (d)   Shall not change the location of cross-section of any street and
shall not increase the number or change the location of street access points on
arterial or collector streets;
         (e)   May include a reduction in parking spaces only when an
associated reduction in floor area or number of dwelling units would permit a
lesser number of minimum required off-street parking spaces than required for
the original development plan. To qualify as a minor amendment this reduction
may not be less than would be required by the zoning district regulations. For
any case where parking in excess of the minimum requirement was provided on the
original development plan, that same number of spaces shall be provided in
excess of the minimum requirement for the proposed minor amendment plan.
      (2)   Procedures for minor amendments.
         (a)   Filing. To request approval of minor amendments to development
plans, the developer shall file with the county a completed application form,
and copies of the plan as required by the terms and conditions of the county’s
application form.
         (b)   Review. The county shall review the plan for compliance with all
applicable requirements and ordinances and shall consult with concerned
agencies as appropriate to assure proper plan review. Upon determination that
all requirements have been met, county staff shall submit its finding to the
Planning Commission Chair for certification. If any question arises as to
compliance, however, the plan shall be referred to the Planning Commission.
         (c)   Certification. Upon certification of approval by the Planning
Commission Chair, county staff shall have copies of the plan prepared and
distributed to other public agencies at the expense of the developer, and
return the original plan tracing to the developer.
      (3)   Content and format of minor amendments. Minor amendments shall have
the same content and format requirements as the original development plan,
except that:
         (a)   The title shall indicate the plan as a minor amendment;
         (b)   A note shall be added listing the exact nature of the requested
changes;
         (c)   The following will be the required language for the Planning
Commission Chair’s certification: “I do hereby certify that this development
plan amendment complies with zoning ordinance provisions regarding amendments
to development plans.”
         (d)   Owners of interest will complete a certification to be signed
and witnessed as follows: “I (We) do hereby certify that I am (we are) the only
owner(s) of the property shown hereon, and do adopt this as My (Our)
development plan for the property,” which will be required language for all
property.
   (I)   Relationship to subdivision regulations. The relationships between
development plans and the subdivision regulations are established as follows:
      (1)   Applicability of subdivision regulations. Although development
plans are not subdivision plats, quite often the development plan does indicate
a need or intent to subdivide property. For any such development plan, the
design and improvement standards contained within the subdivision regulations
shall be applied to proposals contained on the development plan.
      (2)   Combining plans. Development plans and preliminary subdivision
plats may be combined. It is recognized that for certain development situations
it can be advantageous to both the applicant and the Planning Commission to
combine requirements for development plans and preliminary subdivision plats in
order to streamline the development approval process while not reducing the
quality of the review. The following provisions shall be applicable to any such
combined plan:
         (a)   The developer shall meet with county staff no later than five
working days in advance of the filing deadline to discuss the appropriateness
if filing a combined plat.
         (b)   The plan shall show all information required for a development
plan (preliminary or final as appropriate) and all information required for a
preliminary subdivision plat as set forth in the subdivision regulations.
      (3)   Substitution of plans. A preliminary or final subdivision plat may
be substituted for development plans required in conjunction with map amendment
requests. It is recognized that in certain cases a preliminary or final
subdivision plat would be as appropriate or more appropriate to be considered
in conjunction with a map amendment request than would a development plan.
Generally, such situations involve developments where placement of structures
will be tightly controlled by the streets, lot pattern, and requirements for
placement of structures within the zone, and where the applicant sees fit to
have plans prepared at the required level of detail for subdivision plats prior
to receiving a zone change approval. When an applicant is required to provide a
development plan in conjunction with a zoning map amendment request, the
applicant may file a subdivision plat in place of the development plan, if
deemed appropriate by the county. In any disputed case, the county shall make
the final judgment as to whether a development plan or a subdivision plat is
required.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 171.01 AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS, PURPOSE.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The legislature of the commonwealth has in
KRS 100 delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Fiscal Court of the county, hereby adopts the
following regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by
the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
properly due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
      (7)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.

§ 171.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination
of both. In A ZONES, flood waters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are
usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base
flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have mining flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   A1-30 AND AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO AND AR/A ZONES. Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   A99 ZONE. The part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three
feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (Also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD). BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate
map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH and AR/AO
that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1%
or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other human-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for STRUCTURE.
   C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES. Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular
program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated or qualified community
official) from available technical studies, historical information and other
available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by
flood waters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or

the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized
rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date
of the initial FIRM.
   ENCLOSURE. The portion of a structure below the base flood elevation (BFE)
used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage or access to the
structure.
   ENCROACHMENT. The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth,
fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a
floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to
as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the county based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

low risk of flooding.
   FLOOD, FLOODING or FLOOD WATER.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See MUDSLIDES.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See flood-
related erosion.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing
flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and/or the flood boundary
floodway map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by flood waters from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a nonresidential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is water-tight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. The area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory
floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/
or hydrologic analysis.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components and the like.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related to §
171.11, the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the County Kentucky Fiscal Court will
consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to government
responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years.
Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation
are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods,
while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to
all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood
damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property,
unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only
at very high flood insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-
operation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL classification of a
dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretory of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). Increased cost of compliance coverage
provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with state or
community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss
by flood. When a building covered by a standard flood insurance policy under
the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares the building to be
substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the
cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish or remove the building. ICC coverage is
available on residential and nonresidential buildings (this category includes
public or government buildings, such as schools, libraries and municipal
buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE 151.250 - PLANS FOR DAMS, LEVEES AND THE LIKE TO BE
APPROVED AND PERMIT ISSUED BY CABINET (ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC PROTECTION
CABINET).
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction, except
those constructed by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, in the floodplain or
floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such work have
been:
         (a)   Submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement; and
         (b)   Approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit issued;
         (c)   However, the cabinet by administrative regulation may exempt
those dams, embankments or other obstructions which are not of such size or
type as to require approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or
retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the state
shall commence the filling of, or place a building, barrier, or obstruction of
any sort in, any area in the floodplain or floodway unless plans and
specifications for such work have been submitted to and approved by the cabinet
and a permit issued as required in division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this definition is intended to give the Cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes. However, the cabinet may require
approval prior to construction of structures, dams, embankments, levees,
bridges, fill, or other construction related to agricultural operations that
impact the base flood of a stream.
   KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE 151.320 - OFFICERS REQUIRED TO ENFORCE LAW.
      (1)   The mayor or chief executive officer of each city and the County
Judge/Executive of each county, shall have the concurrent duty of enforcing
with the cabinet, within their respective cities and counties, the provisions
of KRS 151.250, 151.280 and 151.310 and rules and regulations issued
thereunder.
      (2)   When a violation of KRS 151.250, 151.280 or 151.310 within his or
her jurisdiction is brought to the attention of a mayor or chief executive
officer of a city or a County Judge/Executive, he or she shall immediately
notify the cabinet of the location and details of such violation.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs include the following
categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA
amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION - FILL (LOMR-F). A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   LEVEE. A human-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. 
      (1)   A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
      (2)   For a LEVEE SYSTEM to be recognized, the following criteria must be
met:
         (a)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised);
and
         (b)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or
state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a
community participating in the NFIP.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support or
basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of
construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or
landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure’s foundation
system.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure’s LOWEST FLOOR, provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required utilities. The
term also includes park trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable
structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to
be improved property. The term MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a
“recreational vehicle.” (See RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.)

(FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter
suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.
(The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be
established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by
age of structure (actual cash value) or adjusted assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL). The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on a community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of
disaster response and recovery.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW). Describes a condition where there is a river, flow
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works and floodplain management regulations.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA. An area with land surfaces and slopes
of unconsolidated material where the history, geology and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRMs. Refer to
FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   NEW, CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of the county’s floodplain management
regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the county’s adopted floodplain management ordinances.
   NONRESIDENTIAL. Structures that are not designed for human habitation,
including but is not limited to: small business concerns, churches, schools,
farm structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses,
recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial
structures, warehouses and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less
than six months duration.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD). As corrected in 1988, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRMs and Digitally Referenced FIRMs
(DFIRMs). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD). See BASE FLOOD. The flood that has
a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any
flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the 100-year flood. Over
the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26% chance of experiencing such a flood
with the SFHA.
   PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY. A community that voluntarily elects to participate
in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that
are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.
   PRE-FIRM CONSTRUCTION. Construction or substantial improvement, which
started on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the

§ 171.03 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas (SFHA) and, as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator or other delegated, designated or
qualified community official as determined by the Fiscal Court of the county
from available technical studies, historical information and other available
and reliable sources, areas within the jurisdiction of the Fiscal Court of the
county, which may be subject to periodic inundation by flood waters that can
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens
of the county.
(Ord. 2011-12, passed 12-19-2011)
§ 171.04 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   The flood insurance study (FIS), and/or accompanying flood insurance rate
maps (FIRMs) and/or flood hazard boundary maps (FHBMs) prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) for
the county, November 1, 2011 wherein special flood hazard areas (SFHA) are
identified, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this
chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow
implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the Fiscal Court by
the Floodplain Administrator and are enacted by Fiscal Court pursuant to
statutes governing land use management regulations. The flood insurance study
(FIS) and/or flood insurance rate map (FIRM), and/or flood hazard boundary maps
(FHBMs) are permanent records of the county, and are on file and available for
review by the public during regular business hours at 3700 Coleman Road,
Paducah, KY 42001, McCracken County Emergency Management Building.

§ 171.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (A)   A development permit shall be required in conformance with the
provision of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in the special flood hazard areas (SFHA). See §
171.26 for instructions and explanation.
   (B)   Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2011-12, passed 12-19-2011)
§ 171.06 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable state regulations. Violation of the
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein
shall prevent the Fiscal Court from taking such lawful action as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violation.

171.99
§ 171.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions; however, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2011-12, passed 12-19-2011)
§ 171.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under

(Ord. 2011-12, passed 12-19-2011)
§ 171.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the Fiscal Court of the county, any
officer or employee, the commonwealth, the Federal Insurance Administration, or
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.
(Ord. 2011-12, passed 12-19-2011)
§ 171.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and
any approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See division (C)
below.
   (C)   Notice of citation; notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly
authorized employee or agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable
cause to believe that a person has caused development to occur which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain
Administrator may issue a citation to the offender stating the violation, prior
notices of violation issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the
development into conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and
within what period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or
penalties are recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the
citation is issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date
the citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
(Ord. 2011-12, passed 12-19-2011)
§ 171.11 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance
are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a
piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for
a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to
the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the Fiscal Court to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other man a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The Fiscal Court of the
county shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of designated county offices
to serve on Appeal Board.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the District Court, as provided in state
statutes.
   (D)   Appeals variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and properly due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a
lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of §§
171.25 through
171.27 and §§
171.40 through
171.46 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the Fiscal Court need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Fiscal Court believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under “public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (7)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (8)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of divisions (A)
through (E) above are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
and
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 171.25 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Fiscal Court of the county hereby appoints the Director of the county’s
Building and Electrical Inspection Department to administer, implement and
enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting or denying development
permits in accordance with its provisions and is herein referred to as the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2011-12, passed 12-19-2011)
§ 171.26 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (A)   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or
other development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
171.04. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature location, dimensions and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of Local
Administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed.
   (B)   Specifically, the following information is required.
      (1)   Application stage.
         (a)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
         (b)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure will be floodproofed;
         (c)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet
the floodproofing criteria in §§
171.41(B) and
171.43(B)(2); and
         (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      (2)   Construction stage.
         (a)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
elevation, as built in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH and A zones
where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
         (b)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

§ 171.27 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed,
authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of
this chapter. The Floodplain Administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this chapter, which are consistent with its spirit and
purpose by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its
provisions.
   (B)   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Permit review. Review all development permits to ensure that:
         (a)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
         (b)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained:

if specific federal or state permit requirements are known, require that copies
of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the development permit;
         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner; and
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, ADVERSELY
AFFECTS means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
171.04, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer §§

any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse;
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and
         (c)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      (4)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
         (a)   Certification required by §
171.41(A) (lowest floor elevations) as shown on a completed and certified

is specified.
      (2)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be produced.
Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060,
§ 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain
permit. The applicant shall provide cross-sections for determining floodway

site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross- sections shall be referenced
to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than
five-tenths foot cross-sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross-section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross-sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.

PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION
§ 190.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community
development. Once land has been divided into streets, blocks, lots, and open
spaces, a pattern has been established which usually determines how well the
county needs for residence, business, and industry will be met. It also
determines to a great extent how well it will be able to meet the demand for
home sites and how efficiently and economically it will be able to provide the
many services demanded of it.
   (B)   After land has been subdivided and publicly recorded, it is costly and
difficult to correct defects and deficiencies in the subdivision layout and in
the facilities provided. In addition, a subdivided area sooner or later becomes
a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and
various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare
of the entire county is thereby affected in many important respects. The
guidance of land development in harmony with county objectives is, therefore, a
matter of serious public concern and it is in the interest of the public, the
developer, and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived, designed, and
developed in accordance with sound rules and proper standards.
   (C)   This chapter, certified copies of which are filed in the office of the
County Clerk, are designed to provide for the harmonious development of the
subdivided areas; for a coordinated layout; for the proper arrangement of
streets; for adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities,
recreation, light, air and access of firefighting equipment; for avoidance of
population congestion through requirements for minimum lot widths and lot
areas; for adequate provision of water, drainage, sewer and other sanitary
facilities; and for reducing flood damage potentials to the greatest extent
possible.

      (12)   Certification on plat by land surveyor as to the accuracy of
survey and plat (see
Form 2 in Appendix I);
      (13)   Certification by the Planning Commission when individual sewage
disposal or water systems are to be installed (see
Form 1 in Appendix I);
      (14)   Certification that the developer has complied with one of the
following requirements:
         (a)   Developers funded by financial institutions shall be required to
execute the following documents in the precise form authorized by the County
Planning Commission and the County Fiscal Court:
            1.   The county subdivision public improvements completion
agreement (see Appendix A);
            2.   The county subdivision letter of credit agreement; or
            3.   The county irrevocable stand-by letter of credit.
         (b)   Developers that elect to use their own self-provided funding and
not relying on funding of a financial institution shall be required to execute
the following documents in the precise form authorized by the County Planning
and the County Fiscal Court:
            1.   The county subdivision public improvements completion
agreement (see
Appendix A);
            2.   The county application for self-funded bond guarantee (see
Appendix D); or
            3.   The county self-funded bond guarantee (

   (B)   Procedure. Submission of a final plat shall follow the same procedure
as for a preliminary plat:
      (1)   Two copies for preparatory review by the County Planner submitted
with an application for preparatory review by the County Planner by 3:00 p.m.,
Wednesday, two weeks prior to the scheduled Planning Commission Meeting. Any
submittal after this time will require a late fee to be included on the agenda.
Plats will be available by noon the following Friday;
      (2)   Ten copies of corrected plat and supplementary materials specified
shall be submitted for conditional approval to the County Planner by 3:00 p.m.,
Wednesday, one week prior to the scheduled Planning Commission meeting. Any
submittal after this time will require a late fee to be included on the agenda;
      (3)   Approval by the Planning Commission shall not constitute acceptance
by the public of the dedication of any street, public way or ground; and
      (4)   When the final plat has been approved by the County Fiscal Court
and certified thereon, one copy shall be returned to the subdivider for filing
with the County Clerk as an official plat of record.
   (C)   Required improvements prerequisite to final approval. A perfectly
prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a prospective lot
purchaser until he or she can see actual physical transformation of raw acreage
into lots suitable for building purposes and human habitation. Improvements by
the subdivider spare the community a potential tax liability. The following
tangible improvements are required to be installed by the developer before
final plat approval in order to assure the physical reality of a subdivision
which approval and recording will establish legally.
      (1)   Monuments; type.
         (a)   Concrete monuments at least 36 inches in length and four inches
in diameter or four inches square with a copper dowel or center marked shall be
set at all corners on the plat.
         (b)   Iron pin or wrought or galvanized iron pipe monuments not less
than three-fourths inch in diameter and not less than 24 inches in length shall
be set at all lot corners not marked by concrete monuments.
      (2)   Concrete monuments; location.
            1.   Monuments shall be placed so that the scored or marked point
shall coincide exactly with the intersection of the lot or property line at
that point and shall be set so that the top of the monument is level with the
surface of the surrounding ground;
            2.   At the intersection of all angles in the boundary line of the
survey;
            3.   At the intersection of street property lines;
            4.   At the beginning and ending of all curves where streets and
alleys are so surveyed; and
            5.   At all angles in property lines of street and alleys.
      (3)   Streets.
         (a)   Grading specifications. All streets, roads, and alleys shall be
graded and prepared according to applicable county and state regulations to
their full widths by the subdivider so that pavements and sidewalks can be
constructed on the same level plane. Deviation from this standard due to
special topographical conditions will be allowed only with the special approval
of the Planning Commission. Center line grades shall be established and staked
by the subdivider.
         (b)   Minimum pavement widths. Pavement widths shall be measured
between curbs and minimum pavement widths to be provided are:
 
Collector                         22 feet
Minor streets                     20 feet
Marginal access streets           20 feet
Alleys, industrial and commercial 18 feet
 
         (c)   Construction of streets. The subdivider shall provide streets
which shall be designed to carry the expected traffic loads and which shall
conform with the standards established by the County Fiscal Court as set up by
the Planning Commission.
         (d)   Curbs and gutters.  
            1.   The subdivider shall provide curbs and gutters. Curbs shall
not be less than six inches in height and shall be constructed of Portland
cement concrete or bituminous concrete. Back-fill shall be higher than the curb
and shall slope toward the curb in order to insure that surface water drains
into the storm system.
            2.   The Planning Commission may waive the requirements for curbs
and gutters if they are not deemed necessary for the proper drainage of storm
water or in cases where all lots have a width of 100 feet or more.
         (e)   Sidewalks.
            1.   For the safety of pedestrians in residential and commercial
subdivisions, the subdivider shall build Portland cement concrete sidewalks on
both sides of the street to meet the following specifications:
               a.   Single-family or duplex housing development: four feet wide
and four inches thick;
               b.   Multi-family or group housing development: five feet wide
and four inches thick; and
               c.   Commercial development: 12 feet wide and four inches thick.
            2.   The Commission may waive construction of sidewalks.
      (4)   Utilities and drainage facilities.  
         (a)   General requirements for installation of utilities. Utilities
shall be provided in rear lot easements wherever possible. When it is necessary
to install utilities in street rights-of-way, the following requirements shall
apply: after grading is completed and approved and before any pavement base is
applied, all of the in-street underground work, water mains, gas mains, and the
like, and all service connections, shall be completely installed and approved
throughout the length of the street and across the flat section. Where the
utility mains are outside the pavement area, the subdivider may be allowed to
omit the installation of service connections provided that at such time as
these connections are needed, they may be jacked across the street without
breaking or weakening the existing pavement. Where the rock is known to exist
beneath the pavement area and at such depth as to interfere with the jacking of
service connections, the Planning Commission shall require the complete
installation of service connections before any base is applied. In cases where
underground utilities must be provided within the right-of-way of streets, they
shall not be installed under the paved portions of such streets.
         (b)   Water supply system. Where, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, the public water supply is reasonably accessible or available to
the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall construct a complete water
distribution system which shall adequately serve all lots and which shall
include appropriately spaced fire hydrants, and this system shall be properly
connected with the public water supply. Where a public water supply is not
within a reasonable distance or otherwise available, the subdivider shall
normally be required to construct a similar water distribution system and
connect it with an alternate supply approved by the Planning Commission.
         (c)   Sanitary sewers. Where, in the opinion on the Planning
Commission, the public sanitary sewer system is reasonably accessible or
available to the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall construct a
subdivision sewer system to adequately serve all lots and connect the
subdivision system to the public system after the county or other appropriate
sewer agency official has approved the size of the lines. Where lots cannot be
served by the extension of an existing public sanitary sewer, the subdivider
shall obtain approval of lot sizes for individual septic tanks and disposal
fields from the Planning Commission.
      (5)   Street name signs. The Planning Commission shall require the
installation of durable street name signs at all intersections. Streets signs
shall meet all MUTCD manual requirements.
         (a)   Lettering shall be at least four inches high;
         (b)   Sign shall be reflectorize or illuminated;
         (c)   Letters shall be white with a green background; and
         (d)   In residential areas, at least two street name sign posts with
double mount shall be mounted at each intersection. All street signage must be
approved by the County Road Supervisor.
      (6)   Completion of improvements prior to approval of the final plat. No
final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission or accepted
for record by the County Clerk until the required improvements listed above are
constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by the appropriate official.
In lieu of such prior construction, the Fiscal Court may accept a security
bond, or certified check, or irrevocable letter of credit to the county in an
amount equal to the estimated cost of installation of the required improvements
whereby the improvements may be made and utilities installed without cost to
the county in the event of default on the part of the subdivider. The bond or
check shall be subject to the conditions that the improvements will be
completed within two years after approval of the final subdivision plat.

§ 190.033 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Exceptional conditions. The Planning Commission may grant a variance
to this chapter where by reason of the unusual shape of a specific piece of
property, or where by reason of exceptional topographical conditions, the
strict application of this chapter would result in extreme practical
difficulties and undue hardship upon the owner of such property; provided,
however, that such relief may be granted without detriment to the public good
and without substantially impairing the modifications, the Planning Commission
may require such conditions as will substantially secure the objectives of the
standards or requirements so varied or modified. Financial disadvantage to the
property owner is not proof of hardship within the purpose of this chapter.
   (B)   Group housing, planned unit developments, office and business complex
developments. Comprehensive group housing, office and business developments,
together with necessary drives and ways of access, including drives and ways of
access privately maintained but dedicated for public use may be approved by the
Planning Commission although the design of the project does not include
standard street, lot, and subdivision arrangements, provided that departure
from the standards of this chapter can be made without destroying their intent.
If the drives and ways of access are to be privately maintained, the plat of
the subdivision shall specifically indicate that said drives and ways are
dedicated for public use and that they will be developed and maintained at the
expense of the owners; and that any owner of a lot in the subdivision shall
have the right to enforce the development or maintenance of said drives and
ways by proceeding in law or in equity against all other owners of lots in the
subdivision.
   (C)   Procedural variance.
      (1)   Waiver of subdivision plats and surveys qualifying for a procedural
variance. Where a proposed subdivision would contain no new streets and no more
than five lots, the procedure of preparing a preliminary plat may be waived by
the Planning Commission.
         (a)   Plats of property containing 100 acres or less shall be drawn to
a scale of no less than one inch per 100 feet. Over 100 acres plats may be
drawn to a scale of more than one inch per 100 feet to keep the drawing on the
maximum sheet size of 24 inches by 36 inches provided clarity is not
sacrificed. Multiple sheets may be used if deemed necessary to portray vital
and accurate information clearly. Smaller parcels should be drawn to a maximum
scale to accommodate the sheet size being used and half sized sheets of 18
inches by 24 inches may be used in these instances. Minimum size of script used
on these plats shall be one-tenth of an inch in height for both upper and lower
case letters and numerals.
         (b)   Name and street addresses of the owners/applicants, as available
from the County Property Valuation Office, of the property to be subdivided,
and legal source of title to the subject property shall be shown on the plat.
Owners of record of all property abutting the subject sites and the legal
source of title to those properties will be indicated on the plat. The name,
address and phone number of the professional land surveyor responsible for the
field survey and plat preparation shall be indicated on the plat.
         (c)   Date field survey made, date plat prepared, north arrow and
basis of same and any bearings shown by the plat will be indicated on the face
of the plat. Provide a brief statement on the face of the plat as to the intent
of the drawing to identify the specific lines being created and/or abolished by
the plat along with easements and other dedications that are being granted by
the drawing.
         (d)   Area of each lot or parcel of land indicated by the plat shall
be shown in square feet and the acreage equivalent, accurate to two decimal
places, shall also be indicated.
         (e)   Boundary lines, lot parcel numbers or designations of the
various properties shown on the plat, bearings and/or angular relationships,
line lengths and curve data, if appropriate, shall be shown along with the
distance from the subject property to the nearest existing intersecting street
or roadway. Also, the distance and bearing or angle from one new division line
and/or corner created by the plat to a boundary line corner of the parent
property from which the tracts or lots are subdivided shall be indicated or
shown.
         (f)   All existing or proposed easements crossing the subject property
or properties shall be shown along with their locations, widths and distances,
and the like, along with a notation for each easement indicating if the
easement is being dedicated by the plat or is existing by prior dedication. If
easements presently exist, note their source of dedication such as a prior plat
or recorded legal document. If record source of easement or easements are not
known or unobtainable, add a note to indicate such.
         (g)   Show all streets or roadways on or adjacent to subject tracts or
lots along with their names, widths and any other pertinent information,
dimensions and the like.
         (h)   Vicinity or key map at a scale not smaller than one inch per
2,000 feet with the scale of the map indicated with a north arrow and any major
adjacent physical development and corporate boundary lines.
         (i)   All existing primary buildings, accessory buildings or
structures and major improvements on the subdivided tracts or lots, including
those that may be on the parent property if the buildings or improvements are
in close proximity to the newly established boundary lines, shall be shown on
the plat. Also, indicate the distance from these buildings, structures or
improvements to the nearest relevant boundary lines.
         (j)   Present zoning designation of the subdivided property, the
parent tract, in the case of residual acreage and all adjacent property shall
be indicated on the plat. The minimum building setback line or minimum yard
line dimensions for the subject property and its parent tract for the various
uses indicated by the most current regulations of the County Zoning Ordinance
shall also be shown and/or noted on the plat.
         (k)   Flood areas as indicated by flood boundary maps published by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with the flood classifications shown
by those maps shall be shown on the plat.
         (l)   Notation that the subject properties are served by a public
water supply system and/or a public sanitary sewer system if said properties
are so served. If the properties are not served by such systems, notation
relative to this fact shall be shown on the plat.
         (m)   Sites and their acreages, if any, to be reserved or dedicated
for parks, playgrounds, schools, or other public uses shall be shown and noted
on the plat. Sites, if any, reserved for semi-public, commercial, or multi-
family uses should also be shown and noted on the plat.
         (n)   In the event it becomes necessary to close and vacate any public
utility easement and/or private roadway easement, a professional land surveyor
shall obtain the approval of all utility agencies and/or grantees of said
easements, as the case may be, as will be indicated by an executed certificate
on the plat signed by the utility company representatives and/or grantees of
said easements.
         (o)   Proposed or existing property restrictions or covenants shall be
shown on the plat or in a form suitable for recording in the County Clerk’s
office. If restrictions or covenants other than those contained in the County
Zoning Ordinance exist, the place of recording of those restrictions and
covenants should be shown by the plat.
         (p)   Plats shall be submitted on sheet sizes no larger than 24 inches
by 36 inches in size.
         (q)   In the case of any residual acreage of any parent tract of land
after the proposed lots or tracts of land are deducted therefrom, the
professional land surveyor shall show or indicate on the plat that the residual
property will still be in compliance with the County Zoning Ordinance with
respect to the remaining area and any other pertinent dimensions required as
stated by said ordinance for the particular zoning category of the property.
When the property to be subdivided contains three acres or less, the entire
boundary line of the tract of land shall be surveyed, monumented, and shown on
the plat even though all of the tract of land may not be the subject of the lot
or lots and parcels being subdivided by the plat. In the event there are
several separate tracts or parcels of land described within the deed or legal
document to the property being subdivided, the professional land surveyor shall
indicate which of the tract or tracts the subject property is being subdivided
and that the residual acreage, if any, from said tract or tracts will still be
in compliance with the aforesaid Zoning Ordinance with respect to area and any
other pertinent dimensions stated by said Zoning Ordinance. Additionally, it is
suggested that the professional land surveyor consult with his or her client’s
legal representative or other entity to determine if the entire tract or parcel
of land from which the subject property is being subdivided should be surveyed
and plated in order to avoid a conflict with KRS Chapter 100.
         (r)   All plats shall meet or exceed the “Minimum Standards of
Practice for Land Surveys in Kentucky” (latest revision) as indicated by 201
KAR 18:150 as mandated by the Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and
Land Surveyors. In the case of a conflict between this chapter for waiver of
subdivision plats and any other ordinance, regulation or standard of practice,
the most stringent provision relative to the particular conflict will control
and prevail.
         (s)   All plats shall contain the necessary and pertinent
certifications and certificates as outlined by the latest revision of the
county subdivision regulations and the aforesaid “Minimum Standards of Practice
for Land Surveys in Kentucky”.
         (t)   Show the location of buried septic facilities, if known and if
not known as to location, place a note on plats that buried facilities do exist
locations are unknown. If the buried facilities are known as to location and if
it is appropriate, an easement for the facility should be shown and described
on plats if the facilities are to be left in place and the facilities would
affect title to newly subdivided lots.
         (u)   Two plat copies required for record in the County Court Clerk’s
office shall be signed by the property owner and/or applicant prior to approval
signatures by the Planning and Zoning Commission chair and County Judge/
Executive’s execution. Exceptions to this requirement may be made on a case-by-
case basis depending upon circumstances that have caused the property owner
and/or applicant’s failure to sign the plat or plats. Copies of the plat
submitted for consideration and approval may be filed without the property
owner and/or applicant’s signature.
         (v)   Statement to be added on the face of the plat: “No revisions or
modifications are to be made to plats signed by Chairman or Judge/Executive

office of the County Court Clerk.
   (D)   Public utilities variance. Variances in lot size and access easements
for service roads may be granted when the subdivision or property is for the
purpose of creating a lot or parcel of land to be owned or leased and
maintained by a public utility to provide electric, water, sanitation, gas,
telephone, cable television service, or telecommunications service to the
general public, provided however, that no private sanitary disposal system
(septic tank and field) shall be installed on any substandard lot (less than
one acre in area). The Planning Commission may waive lot size when alternate
methods of sanitary sewage are proposed.
(Ord. passed 11-27-2017)
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN
§ 190.045 SUITABILITY OF LAND FOR SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision
development. If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be
subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, bad
drainage, steep slopes, rock formation, and other such conditions as may
increase the danger of health, life or property or aggravate erosion or flood
hazards; and if from adequate investigations, conducted by all the public
agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the
public, the land should not be platted and developed for the purpose proposed,
the Planning Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision unless
adequate methods are formulated by the subdivider for meeting the problems that
will be created by the development of the land.
   (B)   Scattered or premature subdivision of land. The Planning Commission
may refuse to approve what it considers to be scattered or premature
subdivision of land which would involve danger or injury to the public health,
safety, welfare, or prosperity by reason of lack of adequate water supply,
schools, proper drainage, good roads and transportation facilities or other
public services; or which would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public
funds for the supply of such services.
(Ord. passed 11-27-2017)
§ 190.046 STREETS.
   (A)   Conformity to the major street (thoroughfare plan). The widths and
locations of all streets in a proposed subdivision will conform to the county
major street plan.
   (B)   Street extensions.
      (1)   The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall provide for the
continuation or projection of streets already existing in areas adjacent to the
area being subdivided unless the Planning Commission deems such continuation or
extension undesirable for specific reasons of topography or design.
      (2)   Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is desirable
to provide street access to adjoining properties, proposed streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundaries of such properties. Where the Planning
Commission deems it necessary, such dead-end streets shall be provided with a
temporary turn-around having a radius of at least 50 feet.
      (3)   The street system for the proposed subdivision shall provide for
extending existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case shall a
street extension be of less width than the minimum width required in this
chapter for a street in its category.
   (C)   Dedication of right-of-way for new streets.
      (1)   The dedication of right-of-way for new streets measured from lot
line to lot line shall be as shown on the county major street plan, or of not
shown thereon, shall meet the following standards:
 
Street Type             Minimum Dedicated Right-of-Way Width
Arterial streets        60 feet*
Collector streets       60 feet
Minor streets           50 feet
Marginal access streets 30 feet
Alleys                  30 feet
The county major street plan may indicate greater right-of-way widths for
certain arterial streets, but in no case shall the subdivider be required to
dedicate a right-of-way width of more than 60 feet for any one street
 
      (2)   All points of access shall be as approved by the Planning
Commission. Marginal access streets may be required by the Planning Commission
for subdivisions fronting on arterial streets.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may waive rights-of-way requirements for
cul-de-sacs or other non-thru roadways.
      (4)   Through proposed business areas, street widths shall be increased
ten feet on each side if needed to provide parking without interfering with
normal traffic movement.
      (5)   In cases where topography or other physical conditions make a
street of the required minimum width impractical the Planning Commission may
modify these requirements.
   (D)   Dedication of right-of-way for existing streets. Subdivisions platted
along existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way if necessary to
meet the minimum street width requirements set forth in division (C) of this
section.
      (1)   The entire minimum right-of-way width shall be dedicated where the
subdivision is on both sides of an existing street. When the subdivision is
located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the right-of-way
width, measured from the center line of the existing roadway, shall be
dedicated.
      (2)   Dedication of one-half of the right-of-way for proposed streets
along the boundaries of land proposed for subdivisions shall be prohibited.
   (E)   Intersections. 
      (1)   Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles.
      (2)   Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least 20
feet. When the smallest angle of street intersection is less than 60 degrees,
the Planning Commission shall require curb radii of greater length.
      (3)   No lot or other parcel of land which abuts on and has access to
either a collector or minor street shall have a service drive, curb cut, or
other means of access to an arterial street within 75 feet of the right-of-way
of any street which intersects such arterial street on the side on which such
lot or parcel is located. These 75 feet requirements can be reduced to 50 feet
on collector streets and 25 feet on minor streets.
   (F)   Curves in streets; horizontal and vertical.
      (1)   A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
      (2)   Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten degrees in the
alignment of a street, a curve with a radius adequate to insure safe sight
distance shall be made. The minimum radii shall be:
 
Street Type Minimum Curve Radius
Arterial    300 feet
Collector   300 feet
Minor       100 feet
 
      (3)   All changes in grade for streets shall be connected by a vertical
curve of a minimum length necessary to provide adequate sight distance and
other safety factors.
      (4)   To calculate the minimum length for the curve connecting changes in
grade:
         (a)   Calculate the algebraic difference in grades; and
         (b)   Multiply by the appropriate value.
 
Values for crest curve Collector streets 50
                      Minor Streets     28
Values for sag curve   Collector Streets 50
                      Minor Streets     35
 
   (G)   Street grades and elevations.
      (1)   Street grades shall conform to the following:
 
Street Type Percent Grade
            Allowable Maximum Desirable Maximum
Arterial    5%                4%
Collector   7%                5%
Minor       12%               8%
 
      (2)   All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of
surface water from the pavement and from the right-of-way by grading and
drainage. For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall not be less
than .5%. Minimal grade of ditches shall be .5% and minimum grade of curbs and
gutters shall be one-third of 1%.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall not approve streets which will be
subject to inundation or flooding. All streets must be located at elevations
which will make them flood-free in order that portions of the subdivision will
not be isolated by floods. Where flood conditions exist, the Planning
Commission shall require profiles and elevations of streets in order to
determine the advisability of permitting the proposed subdivision activity.
      (4)   Fill may be used in area subject to flooding in order to provide
flood-free streets if such fill does not unduly increase flood heights.
Drainage openings shall be designed so as not to restrict the flow of water and
thereby unduly increase flood heights.
   (H)   Marginal access streets. Where the proposed subdivision abuts upon or
contains an existing or proposed arterial street or highway on which traffic
volumes and vehicular speeds warrant special safety considerations, the
Planning Commission may require that marginal access streets be provided in
order that no lots will front on such existing or proposed arterial street or
highway.
   (I)   Street jogs. Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 125
feet shall not be made.
   (J)   Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs). Minor terminal or dead-end streets or
courts which are designed so as to have one end permanently closed shall not be
longer than 500 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around
having a radius at the outside of the right-of-way of a least 50 feet. The
paved area of the cul-de-sac shall have a minimum radius of no less than 35
feet.
   (K)   Street names. 
      (1)   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with other
already existing and named streets shall bear the names of such existing
streets.
      (2)   The name of a proposed street, which is not in alignment with an
existing street shall not duplicate the name of any existing street within the
county, regardless of the use of the suffix or prefix street, avenue,
boulevard, drive, place, court, lane, road, pike, highway, parkway or similar
suffix or prefix.
      (3)   Before final plat approval, the names of streets shall be approved
by the County Planning Commission.
   (L)   Private streets and reserve strips.
      (1)   There shall be no private streets platted within a subdivision,
except as stated in §
190.033(B).
      (2)   There shall be no reserve strips in a subdivision except where
their control is vested in the county, maintained by the developer or a
neighborhood corporation and under conditions approved by the Planning
Commission and as authorized in this chapter.
   (M)   Alleys. Alleys shall be provided to give access to the rear of all
lots used for business and industrial purposes. Alleys shall not be provided in
residential blocks except in cases where the subdivider produces evidence of
the need for alleys which is satisfactory to the Planning Commission.
   (N)   Road specifications. County road specifications approved by the Fiscal
Court are available from the County Road Engineer’s Office.

§ 190.047 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Length. Block lengths shall not exceed 1,200 feet or be less than 400
feet, except as the Planning Commission considers necessary to secure efficient
use of land or desired features of street layout.
   (B)   Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth. However, where this would require lots to front on an arterial
street or highway or where topographical conditions or the size of the property
prevent two tiers of lots, the Planning Commission may approve a single tier of
lots of minimum depth.
(Ord. passed 11-27-2017) Penalty, see §
190.999
§ 190.048 LOTS.
   (A)   Relationship to streets.
      (1)   All lots shall front on a public street or road for a minimum
distance of 75 feet, except those lots which front on the turn-around of
permanent dead-end streets shall front on such turn-arounds for a minimum
distance of 40 feet; or when the portion of a lot is being used exclusively for
access and meets the width requirements in division (A)(4). However, the
Planning Commission may grant a variance to the requirements of this section
when all of the following circumstances and conditions exist:
         (a)   When the lot(s) does not front on a public street or road.
         (b)   When, because of the location of the lot(s), extreme practical
and financial difficulties would place an undue hardship on the owner of the
lot(s).
         (c)   When ingress and egress to the proposed lot(s) can be adequately
and perpetually provided by a private access easement from a public highway or
road; provided however, such a private access easement shall be a minimum width
as listed below:
 
20' wide Less than 2 acres
30' wide Less than 3 acres
40' wide Less than 4 acres
50' wide 4 acres or larger
 
      (2)   The private access easement shall extend from the front of the
proposed lot(s) to a public highway or road and said private access easement
shall be maintained by the lot(s) owner it is serving without any obligation on
the county to maintain same. An ingress and egress easement may be shared by up
to three lots.
   (B)   Arrangement. Each lot in a subdivision shall contain a building site
free from the danger of flooding. Except where unfeasible, side lot lines shall
be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines.
   (C)   Dimensions.
      (1)   Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the county
subdivision and/or Planning Commission regulations where applicable except that
residential lots served by septic tanks and field lines shall be at least 75
feet wide at the building setback line and one acre in area or the minimum lot
width and area determined by the County Health Officer, whichever width and
area is larger. Lots conveyed by deeds, executed prior to October 6, 1978,
which are less than one acre in area and which were in compliance with the
minimum requirements of the Department of Health at the time of conveyance, may
be granted a variance and approved by the Planning Commission provided that
said lots comply with all other regulations.
      (2)   Lot dimensions and minimum size shall follow the requirement of the
County Zoning Ordinance. Minimum lot width shall be measured at the building
setback line.
      (3)   Ratio of lot frontage to depth shall not exceed one to eight
without variance from the Planning Commission.
   (D)   Corner lots. Corner lots (lots which abut on two intersecting streets)
shall comply with the front yard setback provisions along the street upon which
the building on the corner lot fronts. A ten-foot reduction in the front yard
provision is allowed on the side facing the secondary street, provided such
reduction does not result in a side yard of less than 20 feet.

(Ord. passed 11-27-2017)
§ 190.050 UTILITY AND DRAINING EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Except where alleys are permitted for the purpose, the Planning
Commission shall require easements at least 12 feet in width centered along all
rear lot lines for poles, wires, conduits, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, gas
mains, water mains and other utility facilities. Where necessary or advisable
in the opinion of the Planning Commission, similar easements shall be provided
alongside lot lines or across lots.
   (B)   If the Planning Commission deems it necessary for proper drainage
within or through a subdivision, it shall require that a storm water easement
or drainage right-of-way be provided and maintained by the developer or
abutting property owners.
