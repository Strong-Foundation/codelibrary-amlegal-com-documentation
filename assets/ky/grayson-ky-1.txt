arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance
takes effect, except that the proceedings hereafter shall conform, so far as
practicable, to the laws in force at the time of such proceedings. If any
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment is mitigated by any provision of the new
ordinance, such provision may, by the consent of the party affected, be applied
to any judgment pronounced after the new ordinance takes effect.

Council, or a certain city officer, employee, or agent to make additional

serving the same purpose, effected prior to the adoption of this code and not
inconsistent with this code, shall remain in effect.

words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intent of the

words was clearly intended, the error shall be corrected by substituting a
correct spelling of the word or words, or adding the omitted word or words, or
deleting the word or words found to be in error to conform with the original
intent of the provision. The provision shall have the same force and effect as
though the correct words were originally contained within the text of this
code. No alteration shall be made if any question exists regarding the nature
or extent of the error.
§ 10.010   HISTORICAL REFERENCES

ordinance are listed following previous ordinance information as an amendment
to that ordinance. (Example: Ord. 5-89, passed 2-21-89; Am. Ord. 6-90, passed

   (C)   If a cite to the Kentucky Revised Statutes is included in the history
of a provision or section, this indicates that the text of the section reads
word-for-word from the statutes. (Example: KRS 446.010). If a cite from the
Kentucky Revised Statutes is set forth as a “statutory reference” following the
text of the section, this indicates that additional information may be found

section refer to another section of the code where additional information about

section is originally enacted by the adoption of this code.

subchapters, or sections, or other provisions of this code printed in

contract or agreement with the city as well as the performance of any contract
or agreement with any subcontractor or third-party in connection with any
contract or agreement between the bidder and the city.”
   (D)   In addition to price, the following are bid evaluation criteria which
may be used with varying weight dependent upon the particular procurement to be

§ 23.104   COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATION
   (A)   The city will utilize competitive negotiations, regardless of contract
amount, upon a written determination that:
      (1)   Specifications cannot be made specific enough to permit the award
of a bid on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated
bid price (in other words, bidding is not feasible).
      (2)   The services to be procured are professional or personal in nature.
   (B)   With the exception to procurement of certain professional services
(principally engineering services), competitive negotiations will proceed as
follows:
      (1)   Proposals will be solicited through newspaper advertisement;
additionally, a request for proposal (RFP) may be prepared and mailed to
qualified vendors. The newspaper advertisement must be published at least seven
(7) days and more than twenty-one (21) days before the date for receipt of the
proposals. The RFP will describe services needed and identify the factor to be
considered in the evaluation of proposals and the relative weights assigned to
each selection factor. The RFP will also state where further details regarding
the RFP may be obtained. The RFP will call attention to the same regulations
discussed in the bidding process. Requests for proposals will always include
cost as a selections factor. Newspaper advertisements and request for proposal
(s) shall contain information identified and described in the third literary
paragraph of this section.
      (2)   Award must be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined in
writing by a review committee to be the most advantageous to the city.
Evaluations must be based upon the factors set forth in the request for
proposal and a written evaluation of each response prepared. The review
committee may contact the firms regarding their proposals for the purpose of
clarification and record in writing the nature of the clarification. If it is
determined that no acceptable proposal has been submitted, all proposals may be
rejected. New proposals may be solicited on the same or revised terms or the
procurement may be abandoned.
   (C)   For procurement of certain professional services, an alternative to
RFP's may be used. The city may publish a request for qualifications. RFP's
with the exception that cost is not a factor in the initial evaluation. A
review committee will evaluate the responses and rank them by comparative
qualifications. The highest scoring person or firm will be contacted and the
selection committee will negotiate cost. If the committee is unable to
negotiate a satisfactory cost arrangement, the second highest scoring person or
firm will be invited to negotiate. The committee will maintain a written record
of all negotiations.

§ 23.105   NON-COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATIONS
   (A)   Non-competitive negotiations may be used for procurements in excess of
seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) when bidding or competitive
negotiations are not feasible. The city may purchase goods and services through
non-competitive negotiations when it is determined in writing by the Mayor that
competitive negotiation or bidding is not feasible and that:
      (1)   An emergency exists which will cause public harm as a result of the
delay caused by following competitive purchasing procedures; or

attention to the observation of impartiality toward all suppliers. The Office
of Community Development must approve all procurements by non-competitive
negotiation when only one supplier is involved or only one bid or response to
an RFP/RFQ is received.

will be memorialized and supported by a written contract. Where it is feasible
or impractical to prepare a contract, a written finding to this effect will be
prepared and some form of documentation regarding the transaction will also be
prepared. The contractual provisions required by OMB Circular A-102, attachment
“O” will be included in all required contracts.
   (B)   The city may employ and utilize all legally recognized forms and types
of contracts and agreements for the procurement of goods, services, and

the city employs the “design-build” system, the city shall follow the “best
value” contracting principles set out in KRS 65.025(1). The city will comply
with KRS 65.025(1)(e) which provides that: “‘best value’ means a procurement in
which the decision is based on the primary objective of meeting the specific
business requirements and the best interests of the local government. These
decisions shall be based on objective and quantifiable criteria that shall
include price and that have been communicated to the offerors as set forth in
the invitations for bids or request for proposals. Every invitation for bids or
request for proposals shall provide that an item equal to that named or
described in the specifications may be furnished. The specification may
identify a sole brand in cases where, in the written opinion of the City
Council, documented unique and valid conditions require compatibility,
continuity, or conformity with established standards. An item shall be
considered equal to the item named or described if, in the opinion of the owner
and the design professional responsible for the specifications.”

design, and other criteria deemed appropriate;
      (2)   It will perform at least equally the function imposed by the
general design for the public work being contracted for or the material being

organizations that manufacture materials and goods in the United States of
America.

orders, invoices, RFP/RFQ data, and bid materials) will be retained and filled
in an appropriate manner. Where feasible, source documents pertinent to each
individual procurement shall be separately filed and maintained. Where it is
infeasible to maintain individual procurement files, source materials will be

by vendor, by type of procurement, etc.). Whatever form of documentation and
filing is employed, the purpose of this section is to insure that a clear and
consistent audit trial is established. At a minimum, source documentation must

policy governing the conditions of employment, may file a complaint.
Discrimination may be found in practices pertaining to hiring, placement,

benefits, and level of pay. Discrimination is not limited to these areas. The
charging party may file either an informal or formal grievance. At any stage in
the presentation of the complaint, including the information procedure, the
complainant shall have the right to be accompanied, represented and advised by
a representative or an attorney of his own choice. The complainant shall have a

belief, may first consult with his immediate supervisor, prior to filing a
grievance or a formal complaint.
      (2)   In the event that the informal complaint is not resolved in
subsection (1), the complainant will consult with the Mayor and Department
Head. The Mayor will utilize all methods of assistance at his disposal (e.g.,

   (B)   Formal grievance or complaint procedure.

reason of race, color, sex, creed, or national origin in connection with any
personnel action taken by or under the authority of the city, shall be advised
of his rights under this section, including the right to seek advice and
conciliation through the Mayor.
      (2)   The aggrieved party shall, within fifteen (15) days of the action
giving rise to his complaint, submit his complaint, in writing, to the Mayor.

Commission).
      (5)   The Equal Opportunity Review Board shall refer the report on the
Mayor's initial investigation and his recommendations to legal counsel, who
shall review the evidence in the file and the recommendations in light of the
policy of §
27.100, and pertinent laws and regulations, and submit his review and
recommendations to the Equal Opportunity Review Board. Such recommendations by
legal counsel may include recommendations as to matters of fact, law, and
appropriate actions to be taken.

recommendations thereon, and take one (1) of the following actions:

Mayor to take necessary corrective action;
         (b)   Determine that further investigation of the matter is required
and refer the matter to the Hearing Officer for formal investigation; or

      (8)   The Equal Opportunity Hearing Officer shall conduct a hearing on
complaint cases referred to him, to discover all pertinent facts bearing on the
complaint of discrimination. The complainant shall have the right to be
represented at the hearing by counsel of his choice. During the hearing, the
rules of evidence will be relaxed; irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence
will be excluded. The complainant, his legal counsel, and legal counsel for the
city shall be given the opportunity to cross examine witnesses who appear and
testify. Testimony will be under oath or affirmation. A summary of record of
the proceedings shall be made.

of the proceedings and the officer's findings of facts, conclusion of law, and
recommended decisions, and shall prepare his advice and recommendations for the
Equal Opportunity Review Board and submit the entire file to the Board for
initial decision.
      (11)   The Equal Opportunity Review Board shall review the record of the
proceedings, the hearing officer's findings of facts, conclusions of law, and
recommended decision, and the legal counsel's advice and recommendation
thereon, and make a final decision on the complaint. The decision of the Equal
Opportunity Review Board shall be in writing, shall determine whether

   (B)   The charges for sewer user charges shall be levied on all users who
discharge, cause, or permit the discharge of sewage into the public wastewater
treatment system. Should there be users whose contribution to the system
contains biological oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), or ammonia
nitrogen (NH3-N) in concentrations which exceed limits specified herein for
such pollutants and who are permitted to make such contributions to the system
by decision of the Superintendent of the city, then there will be charges known
as excessive strength charges placed upon said users. These shall be imposed by
the Superintendent of the Grayson Utility Commission such that a user
discharging waste to the sewage works having an average biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) content in excess of two hundred seventeen (217) mg/l and/or an
average SS content in excess of two hundred nine (209) mg/l and/or an average
NH3-N content in excess of twenty-four (24) mg/l, with such user being required
to pay a surcharge based upon the excess strength of its wastes. Such
surcharges shall be billed in addition, to domestic level flows. Surcharges may
either be billed separately or shown separately on the normal monthly sewer
bill.
   (C)   Surcharge rates applicable to the user that has received permission
from the Superintendent to contribute excessive sewage strength will be as
follows:
 
SURCHARGE RATES
Parameter Rate
BOD       $ 0.40/lb.
SS        $ 0.42/lb.
NH3-N     $ 1.45/lb.
 
   (D)   (1)   The excessive strength surcharge shall be based on the following
formula, with the total applied to the monthly bill of affected users:
         [a(d-217) + c(f-24)] .00834 X g = Surcharge Payment
      (2)   Where formula components are as follows:
 
A.   Surcharge rate for BOD, in $/pound
B.   Surcharge rate for SS, in $/pound
C.   Surcharge rate for NH3-N, in $/pound
D.   User’s average BOD concentration
E.   User’s average SS concentration
F.   User’s average NH3-N concentration
G.   User’s monthly flow to sewage works in one thousand (1,000) gallons
 
   (E)   No reduction in sewage service charges, fees, or taxes shall be
permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the sewage
works contain less than two hundred seventeen (217) mg/l of BOD, two hundred
nine (209) mg/l of SS, or twenty-four (24) mg/l of NH3-N. The formula for
surcharges may not be construed to generate a negative charge either in any
part or in total.
   (F)   Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a
regular bill of the rate and that portion of the total charge which is
attributable to operations and maintenance of the sewage system.

contribution of users, the total cost of operation and maintenance of the
sewage works, and debt service obligations. Based on such review, the city
shall revise, when necessary, the schedule of sewer user charges to accomplish
the following:
      (1)   Maintain an equitable distribution of operations and maintenance
costs among users of the treatment system; and

from all claims and demands, and shall indemnify them for any liability that
may arise, directly or indirectly, as a result of the approval of applications
or oversight of installation.

   (A)   All procurements made by the city involving the expenditure of
Kentucky Community Development Block Grant Funds will be made in accordance
with the following procurement standards.
   (B)   Procurement transactions, regardless of method or dollar value, will
maximize open and free competition. The city shall not engage in procurement
practices which may be considered restrictive in trade.
   (C)   Purchases will be reviewed by the Director of Community Development to
prevent duplication and to insure that costs are reasonable.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.002   METHODS OF PROCUREMENT
   Procurements shall be made by one of the following methods:
   (A)   Small purchase procedures;
   (B)   Competitive sealed bids;
   (C)   Competitive negotiation; or
   (D)   Noncompetitive negotiation.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.003   SMALL PURCHASES
   (A)   Purchases of supplies, equipment and services which cost between two-
hundred ($200) and ten thousand dollars ($10,000) will require written
estimates but no legal advertisement is required. The city will solicit written
responses from at least three (3) vendors, and if no such responses are
available, a statement explaining the procurement will be prepared and filed.
   (B)   Purchases which cost between fifty ($50) and two-hundred dollars
($200) require three (3) over the telephone quotations of rate, price, and the
like. A memorandum will be prepared setting forth the date the calls were made,
parties contacted and prices obtained. For purchases of less than fifty dollars
($50), efforts will be made to get the lowest and best price, but written
records of such efforts are not necessary.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.004   COMPETITIVE SEALED BIDS
   (A)   Bidding will be employed when detailed specifications for the goods or
services to be procured can be prepared and the primary basis for award is
cost. When the cost of a contract, lease or other agreement for materials,
supplies, equipment or contractual services other than those personal or
professional exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), an Invitation for Bids
(IFB) notice will generally be prepared. This notice will be published at least
once in at least one official newspaper of general circulation within the
community and either distribute the IFB to qualified contractors or publish the
notice in a regionally circulated newspaper. This newspaper notice will appear
not less than seven (7) days and not more than twenty-one (21) days before the
due date for bid proposals. The Mayor may also solicit sealed bids from
responsible prospective suppliers by sending them a copy of such notice.
   (B)   The IFB will include a general description of the goods or services to
be procured, the bid deposit and bond performance required (if applicable), the
location where bid forms and specifications may be secured, the time and place
for opening bids, and whether the bid award will be made on the basis of the
lowest bid price the lowest evaluated price. If the lowest evaluated price is
used, the measurable criteria to be utilized must be stated in the IFB. The
newspaper notice must also contain language which calls to the attention of
bidders all applicable requirements which must be complied with such as Section
3 of the 1968 Housing Act, Section 109 of the 1974 Housing and Community
Development Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11246 and the
Davis-Bacon Act.
   (C)   Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place stated in
the IFBs. The bids will be tabulated by the City Clerk at the time of bid
opening. The results of the tabulation and the bid documents will be examined
for accuracy and completeness by the review committee which will make
recommendations to the City Council. In addition, the committee determines that
all firms are responsive and responsible. The low bidder will be established
and award made. After the bid award is made by the City Council, a contract
will be prepared for execution by the successful bidder. After the contract is
signed, all bid deposits will be returned to all unsuccessful bidders.
   (D)   The city may cancel an invitation for bid or reject all bids if it is
determined in writing that such is in the best interests of the city. The city
may allow a vendor to withdraw a bid if requested at any time prior to the bid
opening. Bids received after the time set for bid opening shall be returned to
the vendor unopened.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.005   COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATION
   (A)   The city will utilize competitive negotiations, regardless of contract
amount, upon a written determination that:
      (1)   Specifications cannot be made specific enough to permit the award
of a bid on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated
bid price (in other words, bidding is not feasible).
      (2)   The services to be procured are professional or personal in nature.
   (B)   With the exception of procurement of certain professional services
(principally engineering services), competitive negotiations will proceed as
follows:
      (1)   Proposals will be solicited through newspaper advertisement;
additionally, a Request for Proposal (RFP) may be prepared and mailed to
qualified vendors. The newspaper advertisement must be published at least seven
days and not more than twenty-one (21) days before the date for receipt of the
proposals. The RFP will describe services needed and identify the factors to be
considered in the evaluation of proposals and the relative weights assigned to
each selection factor. The RFP will also state where further details regarding
the RFP may be obtained. The RFP will call attention to the same regulations
discussed in the bidding process. Requests for proposals will always include
cost as a selection factor.
      (2)   Award must be made to the offerer whose proposal is determined in
writing to the top rated proposal according to the systematic evaluation.
Evaluations must be based on the factors set forth in the Request for Proposal
and a written evaluation of each response prepared. The review committee may
contact the firms regarding their proposals for the purpose of clarification
and record in writing the nature of the clarification. If it is determined that
no acceptable proposal has been submitted, all proposals may be rejected. New
proposals may be solicited on the same or revised terms or the procurement may
be abandoned.
   (C)   For the procurement of certain professional services, an alternative
to RFP's may be used. The county may publish a Request for Qualifications.
RFQ's are handled in a similar method to RFPs with the exception that cost is
not a factor in the initial evaluation. A review committee will evaluate the
responses and rank them by comparative qualifications. The highest scoring
person or firm will be contacted and the selection committee will negotiate
cost. If the committee is unable to negotiate a satisfactory cost arrangement,
the second highest scoring person or firm will be invited to negotiate. The
committee will maintain a written record of all such negotiations.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.006   NON-COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATIONS
   (A)   Non-competitive negotiations may be used for procurements in excess of
ten thousand dollars ($10,000) when bidding or competitive negotiations are not
feasible. The city may purchase goods and services through non-competitive
negotiations when it is determined in writing by the Mayor that competitive
negotiation or bidding, is not feasible and that:
      (1)   An emergency exists which will cause public harm as a result of the
delay caused by following competitive purchasing procedures; or
      (2)   The product or service can be obtained only from one (1) source; or
      (3)   The contract is for the purchase of perishable items purchased on a
weekly or more frequent basis;
      (4)   Only one (1) satisfactory proposal is received through RFP or RFQ;
or
      (5)   The state has authorized the particular type of non-competitive
negotiation (example - the procurement of services by an Area Development
District).
   (B)   Procurement by non-competitive negotiation requires the strictest
attention to the observation of impartiality toward all suppliers. The
Department of Local Government must approve all procurements by noncompetitive
negotiation when only one (1) supplier is involved or only one (1) bid or
response to an RFP/RFQ is received.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.007   CONTRACTS
   Generally, all procurement in excess of two-hundred dollars ($200) will be
memorialized and supported by a written contract. Where it is infeasible or
impractical to prepare a contract, a written finding to this effect will be
prepared and some form of documentation regarding the transaction will also be
prepared. The contractual provisions required by the "Common Rule," 24 CFR Part
85 will be included in all contracts.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.008   DOCUMENTATION
   All source documents supporting any given transaction (receipts, purchase
orders, invoices, RFP/RFQ data, and bid materials) will be retained and filed
in an appropriate manner. Where feasible, source documents pertinent to each
individual procurement shall be separately filed and maintained. Where it is
infeasible to maintain individual, procurement files, source documents will be
filed and maintained in a reasonable manner (examples include chronologically,
by vendor, by type of procurement, and the like). Whatever form of
documentation and filing is employed, the purpose of this section is to insure
that a clear and consistent audit trail is established. At a minimum, source
document data must be sufficient to establish the basis for selection, basis
for cost (including the issue of reasonableness of cost) and basis for payment.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.009   LOCALLY OWNED, MINORITY OWNED, FEMALE OWNED, SECTION 3, AND SMALL
BUSINESSES
   Efforts will be made and documented to solicit participation of locally
owned, minority owned, female owned, Section 3, and small businesses. Where
feasible, evaluation criteria will include a factor with an appropriate weight
for these firms. A list of locally owned, minority owned, female owned, Section
3, and small businesses and also minority businesses located within the trade
region shall be maintained and utilized when issuing IFBs, RFPs and RFQs. This
list shall also be consulted when making small purchases.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
ARTICLE 2. CODE OF CONDUCT
§ 34.020   CONFLICT OF INTEREST
   No elected official, employee or designated agent of the city will take part
or have an interest in the award of any procurement transaction if a conflict
of interest, real or apparent, exists. A conflict of interest occurs when the
official, employee or designated agent of the city, partners of such
individuals, immediate family member, or an organization which employs or
intends to employ any of the above has a financial or other interest in any of
the competing firms.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.021   ACCEPTANCE OF GRATUITIES
   No elected official, employee or designated agent of the city shall solicit
or accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors,
potential contractors, subcontractors or potential subcontractors.
(Res. - - passed 8-14-01)
§ 34.999   PENALTY
   (A)   Any elected official, employee or designated agent of the city who
knowingly and deliberately violates the provisions of this code will be open to
civil suit by the citizens of the city without the legal protection of the
city.
   (B)   Furthermore, such a violation of these procurement standards is
grounds for dismissal by the city.
   (C)   Any contractor or potential contractor who knowingly and deliberately
violates the provisions of these procurement standards will be barred from
future transactions with the city.

necessary for safety to traffic, but may proceed past the red light or stop
sign with due regard for the safety of persons using the street or highway.
   (C)   The driver of an emergency vehicle, when responding to an emergency
call, or of a police vehicle in pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of

   (D)   The driver of any emergency or public safety vehicle may stop or park
his vehicle on any street or highway without regard to the provisions of KRS

§ 40.054   SIGNAL LEGENDS
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one (1) at a
time or in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used,
except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or any other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Vehicular traffic shall
yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and
to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-controlled signal,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a
turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
      (4)   Vehicular traffic that entered an intersection on a circular green
or yellow indication is allowed to complete a left turn during the red
indication.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian-controlled signal, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no
pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except
as follows:
         (a)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by division
(C)(1) above with the intention of making a right turn, may make the right
turn, after stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such
movement, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic
lawfully proceeding through the intersection.
         (b)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by division
(C)(1) above whose vehicle is in the left lane of a one-way highway with the
intention of making a left turn onto the left lane of another one-way highway
with the flow of traffic, may make the left turn, after stopping, unless an
official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding through the
intersection.
         (c)   In instances where there are two (2) right or left turn lanes,
an allowable turn under this section may be made from either lane unless a
regulatory sign specifically prohibits it.
      (2)   The city may, by ordinance, prohibit any such right or left turn
against a steady red signal at any intersection, which prohibition shall be
effective when an official sign prohibiting the movement is erected at the
intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

which is on the eligibility roster for towing services at the City Clerk’s
office within the City of Grayson, or is an applicant for the eligibility
roster.

§ 40.558   RELEASE OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLE PROCEDURES AND APPEAL
   (A)   A vehicle may be released to the owner or other person entitled to
possession only upon proof of ownership or right to possession. The owner of a
motor vehicle which has been impounded pursuant to this section, or other
person entitled to possession, may challenge the validity of such impoundment
and request in writing a hearing before the City Council. The hearing shall be
conducted within ten (10) business days of the date of the request, unless the
owner or other person entitled to possession waives the limitation or the city
shows good cause for such delay. The city shall retain possession of the
vehicle pending the hearing, unless the owner or other person claiming right of
possession posts a bond in an amount equal to the fines and fees accrued as of
the date of the hearing request, or seventy-five dollars ($75.00), whichever is
less. If the owner or person claiming possession of the vehicle is unable to
pay the amount of the bond, the hearing shall be held within seventy-two (72)
hours of the date the request for hearing is received, unless such person
requests or agrees to a continuance. No less than five (5) days prior to the
date set for the hearing, the city shall notify the person requesting the
hearing of the date, time, and place of the hearing. In the case of a hearing
required to be held within seventy-two (72) hours of the date of the request as
provided in this division, then the person requesting the hearing shall be
informed at the time of his or her request, or as soon thereafter as is
practicable, of the date and time of the hearing. Any person who refuses or,
except for good cause, fails to appear at the time and place set for the
hearing shall be deemed to have conceded on his or her and the owner’s behalf
validity of the impoundment. At the hearing, after consideration of the
evidence, the City Council shall determine whether the impoundment was valid
and reasonable. Where it has not been established that the impoundment was
justified, an order releasing the vehicle shall be entered by the City Council.
All fines and fees paid or amounts posted as bond because of the impoundment of
the vehicle shall be returned. Where it has been established that the
impoundment was justified, the City Council shall uphold the impoundment and
condition the release of the vehicle upon payment of all fines and fees.
   (B)   An appeal from the City Council determination may be made to the
District Court of Carter County within seven (7) days of the City Council’s
determination. The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a
copy of the City Council’s order in the same manner as any civil action. The
action shall be tried de novo and the burden shall be on the City Council to
establish that impoundment was justified. If the Court finds that the
impoundment was justified, the owner shall be ordered to pay all fees and fines
accruing as of the date of judgment. If the Court finds that the impoundment
was not justified, the local government shall be ordered to release the
vehicle, if applicable, and to return all fines and fees paid as a result of
the impoundment and the plaintiff shall be authorized to recover his or her
costs. The judgment of the District Court may be appealed to the Circuit Court
in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.

quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer.
   (F)   Each employer shall file with the city a return by January 31 of each

beverages or other cause outside the licensee’s control, then the city shall
refund to licensee the proportionate part of the license fee for the period
during which the licensee is prevented from carrying on the business if the

§ 68.063   REGULATORY LICENSE FEES PURSUANT TO KRS 243.075(1)
   Pursuant to KRS 243.075(1) there is hereby imposed a regulatory license fee
upon the gross receipts of each establishment licensed to sell alcoholic
beverages. The regulatory license fee shall be four percent (4%) of gross sales
of all alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. In the case of retail sales of
package distilled spirits and wine, the regulatory license fee shall be six
percent (6%) of gross sales of the same. The regulatory license fee shall be
six percent (6%) on gross sales of package malt beverages. The regulatory
license fees imposed under this section are reasonably estimated to fully
reimburse the city estimated costs of additional policing, regulatory, and
administrative expenses related to the sale of alcoholic beverages. The City
Council shall adopt at the budget adoption for each subsequent fiscal year,
such annual rates for regulatory license fees as shall be reasonably estimated
to ensure full reimbursement to the city for the cost of any additional
policing, regulatory, or administrative expense related to the sale of
alcoholic beverages. Should the city fail to address the regulatory license fee
in any budget, then the regulatory license fee shall remain at the level at
which it was last fixed until such time as the City Council shall adjust the
fee. Regulatory license fees under this section shall be in addition to any
other taxes, fees, or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit against
payment of a regulatory license fee shall be allowed in an amount equal to any
licenses or fees imposed by the city pursuant to KRS 243.070. The City Clerk
shall immediately notify the ABC Board of the amount of license fees fixed
under this section.
(Ord. 05-2016, passed 10-17-16)
§ 68.064   PAYMENT OF REGULATORY FEES
   Payment of license fees and regulatory fees shall be remitted to the City
Clerk. Regulatory fees imposed in accordance with KRS 243.075(1) and pursuant
to §
68.063 shall be used for the purpose of fully reimbursing the city for the
estimated cost of any additional policing, regulatory or administrative expense
related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the city. All regulatory license
fees shall be in addition to any other taxes, fees or licenses permitted by
law, except that a credit against regulatory license fees in the city shall be
allowed in an amount equal to any license fee imposed by the city pursuant to
KRS 243.070. Regulatory fees shall accrue and be paid on a monthly basis.
Monthly regulatory fees shall be calculated based upon gross receipts from the
sale of alcoholic beverages of each establishment licensed to sell alcoholic
beverages. Monthly regulatory fees shall include regulatory fees based upon
gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages starting from and including
the first calendar day of each month and for each day of the month thereafter
including the last calendar day of each month. Regulatory fees which accrue in
any given month are due and shall be paid to the city no later than by the
twentieth (20th) day of each month immediately following each calendar month in
which the fees accrued. If the twentieth (20th) day of t he month falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, state or federal holiday the deadline for payment of monthly
regulatory fees shall be the next business day of the city government. Failure
to pay such monthly remittance within ten (10) days of the due date constitutes
a violation and will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation.
Penalties for failure to pay monthly remittance by the due date are as follows:
If the monthly regulatory fees are paid in full within five (5) days of the due
date, the licensee will only be charged a $25.00 "late fee." If monthly
regulatory fees and the $25.00 late fee are not paid in full within five (5)
days following the due date to pay the monthly regulatory fees, an additional
late fee of $25.00 shall be charged to the licensee for each day following the
fifth (5th) day from the due date of the monthly regulatory fees.

court of last resort in the final order of the reviewing court.

of construction, act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
existing lease; provided that the licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less than twenty (20) days from the expiration date of the
license, setting forth such facts, and the Administrator is hereby authorized
to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a reasonable

   (A)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any
law enforcement officer or of the Administrator, the Administrator may
institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license granted by the city. A
license may be revoked or suspended only after the licensee shall have been
given written notice, by certified or registered mail, of the proposed
revocation, including notice of the reasons for such proposed action. The
licensee shall be given an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the
proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed action shall advise
the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing. Notice shall be
sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in the last
application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or in
amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
   (B)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall be prescribed by the City Council by municipal
order. Such order shall be maintained on file in the office of the
Administrator and a copy furnished with any notice of proposed revocation or
suspension sent to a licensee. If the City Council shall fail to adopt such
municipal order, the procedures shall be those set out in the Kentucky
Administrative Procedure Act (KRS Chapter 13B).

license becomes final; notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the Administrator. If the revoked or suspended
license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of Police at
the request of the Administrator shall immediately cause one of his or her
officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to the
Administrator.
   (E)   Section 4.29 Appeal from the decision of the Administrator revoking or
suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing of an appeal

operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the entry of a final order
of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on appeal, the
licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under his or her
license.

§ 68.160   REFUSAL OF LICENSE; GUIDELINES FOR APPROVAL OF QUOTA LICENSES
   (A)   The Administrator may refuse to issue or renew a license for any of
the following reasons:
      (1)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for suspension
or revocation of a City license shall be the same as provided for regarding
alcohol beverage licensing, sales or the administration thereof;
      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which suspension or
revocation of any alcohol beverage license would be authorized; or
      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his
application.
   (B)   In the case of quota licenses, before approving an application, the
Administrator is hereby directed to consider, in addition to the factors set
out in KRS 243.450, KRS 243.490 and KRS 243.500, and any other factors the
Administrator determines in his or her discretion to be reasonable and
pertinent to the license application, the following criteria:
      (1)   Ownership. The city places great value on business owners who are
invested in the community.
      (2)   Economic impact. The city desires businesses which make the most
positive impact on the community, in number of jobs, payroll, property
investment and revenues to the city.
      (3)   Site of business. The city is interested in serving all geographic
areas of the city. Therefore, the city does not wish to cluster all licensed
ABC outlets in one area.
      (4)   Aesthetics. The city is committed to protecting the character and
beauty of our community.
      (5)   Capital. The city values businesses that demonstrate their ability
to financially support and sustain their viability.
      (6)   Public support of licensed business in the area. The city intends
that public sentiment and safety be considered in deciding upon the approval of
retail liquor sales licenses in any area of the city.
   (C)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the Administrator may
appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KRS 241.200.
(Ord. 05-2016, passed 10-17-16)
§ 68.161   REVIEW OF LICENSE; BOOKS, RECORDS AND REPORTS
   (A)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter shall
provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of
any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant’s business income is earned from the sale
of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated
with the applicant’s quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide
the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee’s acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identify each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of
food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for
filing of reports notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the
premises of any licensee and examine the books and records to determine whether
the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this chapter, state law and
regulation. In the event the conditions of any license requirement are not met
during any particular quarter, the Administrator shall have discretion in
determining whether suspension or revocation is appropriate or whether the
licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a
good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee, the Administrator may apply
an accounting period of at least one (1) year in determining whether or not the
food sale percentage requirement has been met.
   (B)   Every licensee subject to this chapter shall keep and maintain upon
the licensed premises adequate books and records of all transactions involved
in the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the Administrator and such city employees
who may assist the Administrator in his or her review.
   (C)   For the purpose of assisting the Administrator in enforcement of this
chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC Board under KRS 243.850
shall provide a copy of such report to the Administrator. Copies of any and all
reports and correspondences to the ABC Board required by statute or regulation
shall also be furnished to the Administrator.
(Ord. 05-2016, passed 10-17-16)
§ 68.162   DORMANCY
   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business authorized by
such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and become null and
void after ninety (90) days. Such is the intent of this section. Realizing that
a licensee, like other business, may have his business interrupted by
situations not under his control, various exceptions to the dormancy rule have
been included in this section.
   (A)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of
ninety (90) days shall be deemed inactive, and, unless the conditions set forth
in division (B) of this section are proved to the satisfaction of the
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the Administrator. If the
license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the
Administrator.
   (B)   A license may not be considered dormant and declared null and void
under this section if any licensee who is unable to continue in business at the
premises for which a license is issued due to construction, an act of God,
casualty, death, the acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or
other governmental agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
an existing lease; provided, however that prior to the expiration of ninety
(90) days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to the Administrator a
verified statement setting forth the fact that the licensee is unable to
continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set forth herein, and the
Administrator may grant an extension of the dormancy with the license
continuing to remain in effect during the license period or until same is
transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no business is
transacted during the period; provided, in addition, however, that no such
license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted there under
within twelve (12) months from the date of notice to the Administrator. Such
extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be for such times as
the Administrator deems appropriate in the exercise of his sound discretion.

adopted pursuant thereto, he shall give notice of such alleged violation to the
person or persons responsible therefore, as hereinafter provided.

address; or if a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or about the dwelling
affected by the notice;

in occupancy, or reoccupied until the Building Inspector shall have issued a
certificate stating that the building, structure, or part thereof, and the
proposed occupancy or re-occupancy or use thereof are found to be in conformity
with the provisions of this article. Within five (5) days after notification
that a building, structure, or premises or part thereof is ready for
continuance in occupancy, re-occupancy, or use, it shall be the duty of the
Building Inspector to make a final inspection and issue a certificate
permitting continuance in occupancy, re-occupancy, or use if the building,
structure, or part thereof is found to conform with the provisions of this
article. If the Building Inspector, after final inspection refuses to issue

hearing, and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. At such hearing,
the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show why such
notice should be modified or withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced not
later than thirty (30) days after the day on which the petition was filed.
Provided, that upon application of the petitioner, the Board may postpone the
date of hearing, for a reasonable time beyond the thirty (30) day period, if in
its judgment the petitioner has submitted a good and sufficient reason for the
postponement. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Inspector from whom the appeal is taken certifies to
the Board of Adjustment that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a
stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such
cases, proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Board or by a Circuit Court on application to it, and notice to
the office of Inspector from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.

complied with. If the Board sustains or modifies the notice or order, it shall

an appeal and hearing is not filed with the Clerk of the Board within ten (10)
days after the notice is served.

of the Inspector shall be summarized, reduced to writing, and entered as a
matter of public record in the office of the Inspector. The record shall also

evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does
not describe, with sufficient particularity, the evidence to be produced, that
the compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Mayor or other
person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the
Municipal or State Court for the district in which the person to whom the

ARTICLE V. FIREWORKS
§ 72.400   DEFINITIONS; LEGALITY OF ITEMS
   (A)   Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context indicates or clearly requires a
different meaning.
   “CONSUMER FIREWORKS.” Fireworks that are suitable for use by the public,
designed primarily to produce visible effects by combustion, and comply with
the construction, chemical composition, and labeling regulations of the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission. The types, sizes, and amount of pyrotechnic
contents of these devices are limited as enumerated by this article. Some small
devices designed to produce audible effects are included, such as whistling
devices, ground devices containing fifty (50) milligrams or less of explosive
composition, and aerial devices containing one hundred thirty (130) milligrams
or less of explosive composition. “CONSUMER FIREWORKS” are further defined by
the Consumer Product Safety Commission in CPSC, 16 C.F.R. pts. 1500 and 1507,

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 73.001   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS Chapter 100
delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed
to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council of Grayson, Kentucky, hereby adopts the following
floodplain management ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. 04-2011, passed 4-19-11)
§ 73.002   FINDINGS OF FACT
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Grayson are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption or commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 04-2011, passed 4-19-11)
§ 73.003   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 04-2011, passed 4-19-11)
§ 73.004   OBJECTIVES
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 04-2011, passed 4-19-11)
§ 73.005   DEFINITIONS 
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   “A ZONE.” Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).” A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principle structure. “ACCESSORY STRUCTURES” should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
“ACCESSORY STRUCTURES” are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole
barns, and hay sheds.
   “ACCESSORY USE.” A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   “ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).” Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   “A1-30 AND AE ZONES.” Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   “AH ZONE.” An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   “AO ZONE.” An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   “APPEAL.” A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   “AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AND AR/A ZONES.” Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   “A99 ZONE.” That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system
under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.” A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to
three feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “B AND X ZONES (SHADED).” Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   “BASE FLOOD.” A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the “100-year flood”). “BASE FLOOD” is the term
used throughout this chapter.
   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).” The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, Al-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and
AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that
has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   “BASEMENT.” That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   “BUILDING.” A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for “STRUCTURE”.
   “C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES.” Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   “COMMUNITY.” A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   “COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA).” An area that has been determined by
the Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).” A program developed by Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular
program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. “CRITICAL FACILITIES” include, but are not
limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to
avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and
equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   “D ZONE.” An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   “DEVELOPMENT.” Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,

(BFE) used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the
structure.
   “ENCROACHMENT.” The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth,
fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a
floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   “EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.” Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMs effective before that date. “EXISTING CONSTRUCTION” may also be referred
to as “EXISTING STRUCTURES”.
   “EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by Grayson based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of street and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   “FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD.” The flood that has a 0.2% chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to
low risk of flooding.
   “FLOOD, FLOODING, OR FLOOD WATER.”
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e. mudflows). See “MUDSLIDES.”
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See food-
related erosion.
   “FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).” A map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazard have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   “FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).” A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY.” The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing

inundated by flood waters from any source.
   “FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.” The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.” The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   “FLOODPROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and theadjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the “REGULATORY FLOODWAY”.
   “FLOODWAY FRINGE.” That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. “FREEBOARD” must be applied
not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also
to the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in Article IV of this chapter, means
that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact
that every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of
the property and the community as a whole are subject to the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may
incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.” A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term
does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “GOVERNING BODY.” The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.” The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).”  
      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish,
or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   “KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE 151.250 - PLANS FOR DAMS, LEVEES, AND THE LIKE TO
BE APPROVED AND PERMIT ISSUED BY CABINET - (ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC PROTECTION
CABINET).”
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county, or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to require approval
by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the state
shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch, or
system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the
same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by
the cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water
resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control
thereof so notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter
350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the
regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other
obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which
structures are permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining
operations.
   “LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by letter, to

Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs include the following
categories:
      (1)   “LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).” A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A
LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property
is not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).” A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION - FILL (LOMR F).” A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   “LEVEE.” A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   “LEVEE SYSTEM.” A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.

boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
73.300(C)(2).
      (2)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
73.007, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonable
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
73.200 through
73.206;
      (3)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
73.201(B) a floodproofing certificate;

building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or
perform any duty imposed upon the administrator by this chapter.
      (2)   If such structure or premises are occupied, he or she shall first
present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure, or
premises are unoccupied, he or she shall first make a reasonable effort to
locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such request
entry.
      (3)   If entry is refused the administrator shall have recourse to every
remedy provided by law to secure entry.
      (4)   When the administrator shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or
occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building,
structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the administrator for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter.
   (G)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her agent, or to the

§ 73.201   SPECIFIC STANDARDS
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
73.007, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction.
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than one (l.0)
foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of §
73.201(C).
         (a)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified.
         (b)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one (1.0) foot above the base
flood elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator
will determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined.
Methods include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical
data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be
produced. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4,
Regulation 060, states as a part of the technical requirements for a state
floodplain permit: the applicant shall provide cross sections for determining
floodway boundaries (and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed
construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall
be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no
more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall betaken at
those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where
hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section
shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and
at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that
significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional
cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for
making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
         (c)   In all other zones, elevated one (1.0) foot above the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated, to conform with §
73.201(A) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation one (1.0) foot above the level
of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than one (1.0) foot above the level of the base
flood elevation; or
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
73.101(A)(3).
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in §
73.201(D).
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation one (1.0) foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical
Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed
on sites located within A, Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels;
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; or
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood.
         (b)   All manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1.0) foot
above the level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
so that either:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one (1.0) foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, Al-30,
AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must either:
         (a)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         (c)   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured
homes”.
      (4)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed
and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations,
is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
   (E)   Floodways.
      (1)   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
73.007 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply: prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge.
      (2)   If division (E)(1) of this section is satisfied, all new
construction and substantial improvements and other proposed new development
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
73.200 through
73.206.

(UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
73.007, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with §

(Ord. 04-2011, passed 4-19-11)
ARTICLE IV. APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 73.300   APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance
are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a
piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for
a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to
the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The City Council of Grayson
shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of members of the City Council.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)    The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local District Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)    A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
73.005 under “public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of division (D)(1)
through (11) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not
create a public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Grayson Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. 04-2011, passed 4-19-11)
§ 73.999   PENALTY
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this ordnance
and/or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation
is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set forth in the
citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or requesting a
hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the citation is issued
does not respond to the citation within seven days, that person shall be deemed
to have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a violation
occurred shall be considered final.
   (D)   Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special
exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined no less than $100 or imprisoned for not more
than 10 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses
involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain
Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent
or remedy any violation.
