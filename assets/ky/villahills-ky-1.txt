under federal or state law, using evidentiary standards required by the law at
issue. The city shall have the right to hire an independent consultant, at the
applicant's expense, to evaluate the issues raised by the exception request and
shall have the right to submit rebuttal evidence to refute the applicant's
claim.

61.300.
   (C)   Whenever it is necessary for Animal Services to make an inspection in
order to perform any duty or enforce any provision of this chapter or any other
applicable state statute, they are hereby empowered to enter property at a
reasonable time and inspect the premises. Animal Services shall have the power
only if consent of the owner or occupant of the property is freely given, a
search warrant is obtained or such exigent circumstances exist that a
warrantless, nonconsensual search is required.
   (D)   All animals of any age running at large, as defined in this chapter,
and found in the county, may be picked up by Animal Services and impounded in
the animal shelter. If Animal Services can reasonably return the animal they
may do so and may issue a uniform citation to the owner. Community cats are
subject to impoundment under this section.
   (E)   All animals of any age which have bitten a human being may be picked

officer has reason to believe the animal poses a threat to the safety of the
general public, the animal shall be taken into custody by Animal Services and
the owner shall be issued a uniform citation for harboring a vicious animal.
The animal shall remain in the custody of the county until the accused is given
a hearing before a district court judge. Should that judge find probable cause
for a charge of harboring a vicious animal, the court shall order temporary
forfeiture of the animal to Kenton County Animal Services pending final
disposition of the case.
   (G)   Any dog, required to be licensed but found unlicensed, may be
impounded for a minimum period of five days unless it is earlier claimed by its

the dog may then be offered for adoption or may be euthanized at the discretion
of the Director of Animal Services. Any person claiming or reclaiming a dog
pursuant to this section shall pay a reasonable fee for board, administration,

such property, in writing, that the property is in danger of being declared a
chronic nuisance property.
   (B)   The warning shall be sent by mail with delivery confirmation and
contain:
      (1)   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property;
      (2)   A concise description of the nuisance activities that exist, or
that have occurred on the property;
      (3)   A demand that the person responsible for such property respond to
the notice within ten (10) days of service of the notice to discuss the
nuisance activities and create a plan to abate the chronic nuisance;
      (4)   Offer the person responsible an opportunity to abate the nuisance
activities given rise to the violation; and

issue a notice declaring the property to be a chronic nuisance property and
post such notice at the property and issue the person responsible a civil
citation pursuant to §
32.06 of this code.

does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activities or if no agreement
is reached, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her designee(s), shall
issue a notice declaring the property to be a chronic nuisance property and
post such notice at the property and issue the person responsible a civil

and restoration of property owner's property as well as the berm adjacent to
their property.
      (5)   Property owner shall pay a one-time fee to the city as determined
by the City Administrator as a tap-in fee, which shall be paid at the time of
the application.
      (6)   In the event that the city’s drainage system becomes backed up,
clogged, or overwhelmed due to either a faulty tap-in, or multiple tap-ins, the
city may at its option require that the property owner remove the tap-in at the
property owner’s cost, or alternatively, the city may remove the tap-in and
charge the costs and fees for the removal to the property owner.

§ 95.03 RECREATIONAL FIRE RESTRICTIONS, OUTDOOR COOKING FIRE RESTRICTIONS AND
UNRESTRICTED FIRES.
   (A)   Recreational fire restrictions.
      (1)   It is the intent of the City of Villa Hills, Kentucky that all
citizens, property owners and renters shall have the opportunity to have
recreational fires at single and multi-family dwellings provided that such
recreational fires are in compliance with the requirements and restrictions
relating to recreational fires. It is further the intent of the City of Villa

and any Code Enforcement Officer shall enforce these requirements and
restrictions so as to insure that such recreational fires do not become a
public nuisance or compromise public safety.
      (2)   A RECREATIONAL FIRE is a fire that meets the requirements and
restrictions laid out in this section of the City of Villa Hills Code of
Ordinances. If the fire does not meet the requirements and restrictions of a
recreational fire, outdoor cooking fire or unrestricted fire then it is deemed
a bonfire and subject to permit requirements and restrictions under §
95.04.
      (3)   Portable fire pits, chimineas, patio hearths, fire tables and other
similar devices shall be elevated from the ground and shall be fabricated from

shall be dug into the ground and shall comply with the provisions of this
ordinance governing such pits.
      (4)   Recreational fire requirements and restrictions:
         (a)   The recreational fire must be fueled by seasoned (i.e., not
green) firewood, charcoal, natural gas, propane, or other clean burning fuel,
with emissions equal or less than that created by seasoned firewood and all
devices must be based upon a non-combustible surface, or a surface protected by
a fire retardant mat designed specifically for this purpose.
         (b)   Material used to make a recreational fire cannot include
construction materials, plastics, trash or rubbish.

(3) feet in diameter, height, or width; and no higher than three (3) feet,
measured from the location upon which the wood or other fuel source is placed
upon to the top of the wood or other fuel source. No burning firewood or other
burning fire fueling material shall extend outside the fire pit.
         (d)   All recreational fires shall be placed at a safe reasonable
distance from any structure, ten (10) feet from any flammable or non-portable
combustible material when used, and set back a minimum of six (6) feet from
adjoining property lines.
         (e)   The means for extinguishing any fire must be kept immediately
available at all times when a recreational fire is burning.
         (f)   No recreational fire shall be started or allowed to continue
burning when the wind direction or wind speed will cause embers or other
burning material to be carried onto any building or combustible material; nor
any time that wind direction will carry smoke into the open windows of any
building. Smoke from any recreational fire shall not create a nuisance for
neighboring properties and fires shall be completely extinguished when a police
officer, duly authorized Fire Authority member, or Code Enforcement Officer
determines a nuisance is present or the fire otherwise compromises public
safety.
         (g)   If a permanent fire pit is used, the construction and use of the
permanent fire pit shall, in addition to the above requirements, comply with
the following additional requirements:
            1.   The diameter, width, and height of the pit opening or base
upon which the fuel material is placed shall not exceed three (3) feet;

            3.   The top of the rim of the pit shall be lined with rock,
concrete brick, steel, or other non-combustible material designed and of a
sufficient width to stop the spread of fire.

contained in a device or structure designed for such use is permitted but
subject to the following requirements and restrictions:
      (1)   Material used to make a cooking fire cannot include construction
materials, plastics, trash or rubbish.
      (2)   All cooking devices must be in good working condition to prevent
the possible spread of the fire.

(1-) and two- (2-)family dwellings, regardless of whether such units are rented
or owned as a condominium or other form of ownership, no hibachi, gasfired
grills, charcoal grills, wood or gasfired fireplaces or stoves, or other
similar devices shall be used, fired, burned or kindled on any balcony or under
any overhanging portion of any building or structure or within ten (10) feet of
any structure. Listed electric ranges, grills, or similar electrical apparatus
shall be permitted.
      (4)   No cooking fire shall be started or allowed to continue burning
when the wind direction or wind speed will cause embers or other burning
material to be carried onto any building or combustible material; nor any time
that wind direction will carry smoke into the open windows of any building.
Smoke from any cooking fire shall not create a nuisance for neighboring
properties and fires shall be completely extinguished when a police officer,
duly authorized Fire Authority member, or Code Enforcement Officer determines a
nuisance is present or the fire otherwise compromises public safety.
      (5)   A fire shall be deemed a recreational fire and not a cooking fire
and thus subject to the requirements and restrictions of recreational fires,

Authority, or Code Enforcement Officer, the primary use of the fire is
recreational in nature and not for cooking.

      (l)   The following devices that involve an open fire or flame may be
used without restrictions as long as they are used in a safe manner and the use
follows the recommended manufacturer’s guidelines: The burning and/or use of:
lighters, matches, candles, lanterns, lamps, insect repellent torches, tiki-

Authority, and any city-authorized Code Enforcement Officer are authorized and
shall issue orders to any individual or property owner to immediately
extinguish any fire, however classified, including, without limitation, a
recreational fire, cooking fire, unrestricted fire, or bonfire deemed to be a
nuisance or that otherwise compromises public safety. Members of the Police
Department or the Fire Chief, any Assistant Fire Chief, or any designee of the
Fire Chief, in the event of a second or subsequent call concerning a
recreational fire at a particular address, may issue written orders to the
property owner or any individual either prohibiting additional fires or types
of fires specified in the orders or permitting additional fires or types of
fires specified in the orders with such conditions or restrictions deemed

of a felony, a misdemeanor for which imprisonment or other confinement was a
possible penalty, any other crime in which moral turpitude was involved; or any
other crime which was directly related to a business of the type which is the
subject of the application. In determining if a conviction was directly related
to a business, the City Administrator shall consider:

was convicted.
            2.   The relationship of the crime to the purpose of the regulation
of the business.
            3.   The relationship of the crime to the ability, capacity and
fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of
the operation of the business.
            4.   The extent to which the person convicted has been successfully
rehabilitated.
         (c)   The City Administrator shall consider whether the business is of
a type that the operation, unless closely supervised, has a probability of
generating or resulting in criminal activity or adversely affecting the health,
safety, morals and welfare of occupants or residents of adjoining property, the
citizens and residents of the city, or will constitute a nuisance.
         (d)   The City Administrator shall consider the business history of
the applicant including:
            1.    Whether the persons named and identified in the application

Villa Hills or any other city, county or state and the reasons therefor; and
            2.   Whether complaints have been received by the city about the
business practices or responsibility of the persons named and identified in the

         (e)   The City Administrator shall consider whether the persons named
and identified in the application are indebted to the city for delinquent
taxes, assessments, fines or similar obligations.
         (f)   The City Administrator shall consider whether the business and
the proposed location complies with all applicable laws, including, without
limitation, land subdivision and use, zoning, building construction and

the City Administrator shall notify the Tax Collector, or any designee thereof,
of either:
            1.   The approval of the application; or
            2.   The approval of the application conditionally; but if the
application is approved conditionally, the City Administrator shall determine
and require those conditions that are reasonably necessary to accomplish the
intent of this chapter, including, without limitation:
               a.   A requirement that the applicant post bond with surety

written notice from the City Administrator, within thirty (30) days after an
application for a Business Regulatory License required by this chapter has been
accepted by the City Administrator for review pursuant to this chapter, that
the application was either conditionally approved or disapproved, the Tax
Collector, or the designee thereof, shall issue the Business Regulatory License
that is the subject of the application and mail it to the applicant at the
address indicated in the application; and, thereafter, the applicant may engage
in the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business described in
the application, but only at the address thereof indicated in the application,
until that Business Regulatory License expires or is suspended or revoked
according to the provisions of this chapter.
      (5)   Conditional approval of application. In the event that the Tax
Collector receives a written notice from the City Administrator, within thirty
(30) days after an application for a Business Regulatory License required by
this chapter has been referred to the City Administrator for review pursuant to

requested, to the address of the applicant indicated in the application, along
with a notice that the license will be issued by the Tax Collector only upon

the conditions to be performed prior to the issuance of the license. The notice
shall also state that if the acceptance is not received by the Tax Collector
within such time, the application will thereby be disapproved.
      (6)   Disapproval of application. In the event that the Tax Collector
receives a written notice from the City Administrator, within thirty (30) days
after an application for a Business Regulatory License required by this chapter
has been referred to the City Administrator for review pursuant to this
chapter, that the application was disapproved by the City Administrator, the

requested, at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing:

§ 111.04 BUSINESS TAXATION.
   (A)   Levy and imposition. For the purpose of providing funds for the
general operating expenses of the city and the municipal services and functions
provided thereby, and subject to the provisions of KRS 67.750 through 67.795,
and except as provided in §
111.03(D)(3)(c), an Occupational License Fee is hereby levied and imposed upon
everybody engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
businesses in the city, for the privilege of that engagement.
   (B)   Rate. The Occupational License Fee that is levied and imposed by this
chapter is at the rate of:
      (1)   Employees. 1.5% of all compensation earned by an employee for
labor, work or services provided in the city.
      (2)   Those not employees. 0.075% of gross receipts of everybody, other
than employees, who is engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession
or other business in the city.
   (C)   Apportionment of gross receipts. Pursuant to the authority of KRS
67.753(4), it is hereby determined that the apportionment provisions of KRS
67.753 do not fairly represent the extent of the engagement in the city of
those, other than employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business both within and outside of the city;
and, accordingly, the following described property factor is hereby added to
the payroll factor and the sales factor provided in KRS 67.753 for the
apportionment of the gross receipts of those, other than employees, who are
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business both
within and outside of the city:
      (1)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or
rented and used in the city during the computation period, and the denominator
of which is the average value of all of the taxpayer’s real and tangible
personal property owned or rented and used anywhere during the computation
period. In the determination of the property factor:
         (a)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.
Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight (8) times the net annual
rental rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any
annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub-rentals.
         (b)   The average value of property shall be determined by averaging
the values at the beginning and ending of the computation period, but the City
Administrator may require the averaging of monthly values during the
computation period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value
of the taxpayer’s property.
      (2)   The proportion of the total gross receipts everywhere of those,
other than employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business both within and outside of the city that are
subject to the Occupational License Fee established by this chapter, shall be
determined by multiplying the total gross receipts thereof everywhere by the
quotient of the total of the payroll factor and the sales factor described in
K.R.S.67.753 (2) and (3), and the property factor described in the previous
§110.04(C)(1), that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business had in the city during the tax period, divided by the total number of
those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business had in the city during the tax period. The total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the city during the tax period will always be either 1, 2 or 3. For example,
if the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business:
         (a)   Had only the sales revenue factor in the city, during the tax
period, without either the property factor or the payroll factor in the city,
the total number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business had in the city during the tax period would be 1;
         (b)   Had both the sales revenue factor and the payroll factor in the
city, during the tax period, without the property factor in the city, the total
number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business had in the city during the tax period would be 2; or
         (c)   Had the sales revenue factor, and the payroll factor, and the
property factor in the city, during the tax period, the total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the city during the tax period would be 3.
   (D)   Administrative provisions. The provisions of this chapter shall be
administered and enforced by the City Administrator, who is hereby authorized
to promulgate any additional regulations in regard thereto which are not
inconsistent with any state statute, or any ordinance of the city, or any
executive order of the Mayor.
   (E)   Purpose of Occupational License Fee. The purpose of the Business
Regulatory License fees and the Occupational License Fees imposed and levied by
this chapter is to fund the general operating expenses of the city, including,
without limitation, police, fire, emergency medical, public works and
administrative services.

SEVERABILITY
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS 151.230 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the legislative body of Villa Hills, Kentucky, hereby adopts the
following floodplain management ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Villa Hills are subject to
periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one percent (1%) annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of

victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the Villa Hills
City Commission will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure
adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for
fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Structures that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In
addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject
to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance
rates.

misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (i.e. mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is
in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.

damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code Enforcement Official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.26 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
152.11, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall
be provided in accordance with standards of division (C) below.
      (1)   In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified
in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest
adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than two (2) feet
above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative
Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the
technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: The applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby base
flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross
sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated two (2) feet above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) above or together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed to an elevation two (2) feet above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification along with the
design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (E) below.
      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an
elevation two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this
requirement must meet or exceed the standards of division (C) below.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed
on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels;
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, and
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of
a flood.
         (b)   All such manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than two (2) feet
above the level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
so that either the:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation; or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
A1- 30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes.
         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
152.11 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If this division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
152.25 through
152.31
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.27 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.11, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with §
152.11.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.28 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.11, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.

(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 152.35 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the legislative body to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.36 DESIGNATION OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
    The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of these regulations.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.37 DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for variances
from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   (B)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment may
appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky Revised
Statutes.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.38 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in
other sections of this chapter, and the:
   (A)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
   (B)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   (C)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
   (D)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the existing
or proposed facility;
   (E)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of
functionally dependent use;
   (F)   Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
   (G)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
   (H)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
   (I)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   (J)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
   (K)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.39 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
chapter, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (A)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard. MINIMUM
NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the legislative body need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the legislative body
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
152.05 under PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE ), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in §
152.05) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (D)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
   (E)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) upon request.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of §
152.28 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.40 VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.
   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that:
   (A)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage.
   (B)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Kenton County Clerk and shall be recorded in
a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.41 HISTORIC STRUCTURES.
   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (see definition in §
152.05) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(Ord. 2013-06, passed 2-20-2013)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Civil offense.  If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain development permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed as indicated in
division (C) below.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven (7) days of the date the
citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven (7) days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
   (D)   Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special
exceptions, shall constitute a Class A misdemeanor offense. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
and/or imprisoned for not more than twelve (12) months, and in addition, shall
pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking such other lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

notice to the holder and upon a hearing before the Code Enforcement Board as
hereinafter provided.
   (A)   Notice. The Building Official shall mail, both certified and regular,
a notice of any request for revocation or suspension of the rental license

unclaimed, the suspension notice shall then be conspicuously posted on the
building. The suspension notice shall contain the following information:
      (1)   That the Building Official has determined that the rental unit
fails to comply with the applicable laws or any other provision set forth
herein, indicating the specific reasons for such failure, including copies of
applicable inspection reports or noncompliance notices sent to the owner which
have not been remedied. The suspension notice shall be delivered to the tenant
of each rental unit and shall also be conspicuously posted on the rental unit.

Enforcement Board with the recommendation to revoke or suspend the rental
license who shall have the final determination.
      (4)   The date, time and place for the hearing before the Code
Enforcement Board.
      (5)   That after any revocation or suspension, the rental unit shall not
be reoccupied or rented until sufficient proof has been provided to the
Building Official that all violations are corrected and the rental license
reinstated or reissued. Such proof shall be in the form of an inspection by the
Building Official at the owner's expense.
   (B)   Hearing. The Code Enforcement Board created under Chapter 32 of the
Villa Hills Code of Ordinance shall be designated as the body authorized to
conduct hearings on recommended suspension or revocation of any rental license
and shall have the power to render a final decision and order with regard

of this chapter.
   (C)   Decision and appeal. The decision of the Code Enforcement Board shall
be reduced to writing and shall be considered final. The written decision shall

of the issuance thereof, to the Kenton District Court.

voluntarily requesting an inspection pursuant to this chapter to determine
whether a rental unit complies with applicable laws, even though such
inspection may not be required pursuant to this chapter. The fee for voluntary
inspections may be waived at the Building Inspector's discretion. Any rental
unit inspected under this section shall not be subject to a voluntary

has been served shall be deemed a separate offense.
