any property, and accrued interest and other charges, constitutes a lien on the
property to secure payment to the bondholders or any other source of financing
of the improvement. The lien takes precedence over all other liens, whether
created prior to or subsequent to the publication of the ordinance, except a
lien for state and county taxes, general municipal taxes, and prior improvement
taxes, and is not defeated or postponed by any private or judicial sale, by any
mortgage, or by any error or mistake in the description of the property or in

from payment thereof, or from the penalties or interest thereon, as herein
provided.

any other property, or any other change may be made without such compliance if
all property owners of the improvement consent.

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 36.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)    As defined in §
36.01, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
36.12, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a request or complete a written application for such records at the
office of the City Clerk/Treasurer during regular office hours, except during
legal holidays. The written application shall be hand-delivered, mailed, or
sent via facsimile or e-mail to the City Clerk/Treasurer’s office. The City
Clerk/Treasurer may require the applicant to provide a statement in the written
application on how the applicant is a resident of the commonwealth.
   (B)    If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in compliance
with the open records law and the requested records are immediately available,
the custodian shall deliver the records for inspection. Suitable facilities
shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk/Treasurer for the
inspection. No person shall remove original copies of public records from the
offices of any public agency without the written permission of the official
custodian of the record.
   (C)    An applicant may inspect public records during the regular business
hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from the city
through the mail if the applicant’s residence or principle place of business is
outside of the county in which the city is located and he has precisely
described public records which are available within the city. If the person
requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed, the official
custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of
mailing.
   (D)    The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
36.01.
   (E)    Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than 8½ inches × 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor’s requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement form the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement form the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)    The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost

property have been abated and the property has been returned to its intended
productive use, then the Board shall direct that the property be removed from
classification list as an abandoned urban property or blighted urban property.
   (E)   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any final

   An officer or employee may not falsely impugn the reputation of a resident,
employee, or an officer of another jurisdiction. If an officer or employee
believes their accusation to be true, and then learns that it was false, even
in part, they should apologize in the same forum and manner where the
accusations were made. A failure to apologize within a reasonable period of

   (A)   Officials, elected or otherwise, can maintain a personal presence on
social media. However, to be considered personal, these officials cannot
mention of their status as a public official. Any mention of their status
potentially changes the nature of the page to one for a public agency, which
requires recordkeeping in accordance with the Kentucky Department of Library
and Archives retention schedule and subjecting the entire page to Open Records’
requests.
   (B)   Officials who want to interact with the community on social media in
their role as a city official must maintain a separate social media account
from their personal account for this purpose if they have a personal account.

will maintain an updated list of official pages of city officials.
   (C)   Officials shall conduct themselves as a representative of the city and
act respectfully.
   (D)   Elected official pages shall clearly indicate that any content posted
or submitted for posting is subject to public disclosure. In addition,
guidelines, if any, shall be posted conspicuously on the page.
   (E)   No comments shall be deleted unless in violation of posted guidelines.
Deleted comments shall be provided to the City Clerk and must be saved for one
year.
   (F)   City officials shall not conduct city business through social media.
If receiving a specific request from a resident, the city official shall direct
the resident to contact the official through official lines of communication,
such as email or phone.
   (G)   Elected officials shall not discuss issues pending before the
legislative body. Elected officials may seek public input but shall not respond
to comments. Engaging in substantive conversations on social media could
require retention of the posts and may violate the Open Meetings Act if other
elected officials are also engaging in the discussion.
(Ord. 2023-11, passed 7-18-23)
§ 40.24 EMAIL.
   (A)   Emails sent or received by officials relating to official business

follows:
   (A)   Green alone or “Go”: Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or “Caution” when shown following the green or
“Go” signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or “Stop”: Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or “Go” is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed

purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing yellow lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from

proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant
person.

vehicle may challenge the validity of such impoundment or immobilization and
request in writing a hearing before the Parking Violation Hearing Board. The

unless the owner or other person claiming right of possession posts a bond in
an amount equal to the fines and fees accrued as of the date of the hearing

determine whether the impoundment or immobilization was valid and reasonable.

justified, it shall enter an order releasing the vehicle. All fines and fees
paid or amounts posted as bond because of the impoundment of a vehicle shall be
returned and the owner shall not be responsible for any fees owed to a
designated towing company. If the Board determines that the impoundment or
immobilization was justified, the Board shall uphold the impoundment or

perimeter or area fence. Within this perimeter fence, the dangerous animal must
be humanely confined inside a pen or kennel of adequate size. The pen or kennel
may not share common fencing with the area or perimeter fence. The kennel or
fence must have secure sides, a secure top attached to all sides, the sides
must either be buried two (2) feet into the ground, sunken into a concrete pad,
or securely attached to a wire bottom. The gate to the kennel must be locked.

the duty of the owner of any animal or anyone having an animal in his
possession to keep the animal under restraint and in control at all times while
the animal is off the real property limits of the owner, possessor, or
custodian. For purposes of this section, the animal is deemed under control
when, it is securely confined within a vehicle parked or in motion, or it is
properly confined within a secure enclosure with the permission of the owner of
the property where the enclosure is located, or it is securely restrained by a
leash or other device held by a competent person.
   (F)   Additional requirements that must be taken by owners of dangerous
animals. Except when being transported in, and securely confined within, a
vehicle, no dangerous animal shall be permitted off the property of his owner
except when it is attended by its owner, and is restrained by a secure collar
and leash (not to exceed six (6) feet in length), both collar and leash to be
of sufficient strength to prevent escape, and muzzled by sufficient means to
prevent its biting other persons or domestic animals.
   (G)   Enforcement of restrictions on dangerous animals.
      (1)   In the event that any law enforcement officer has probably cause to
believe that a dangerous animal is being harbored in violation of this
subchapter he may:
         (a)   Order the violation immediately corrected and cite the owner or
keeper to appear in court for the violation, or
         (b)   If the violation cannot be immediately corrected and the animal
is posing an imminent serious threat to human beings or other domestic animals,
the animal may be seized and impounded, in which case the owner or keeper will
be cited to appear in court for the violation. At the owner’s request and
expense, such impoundment may be at a veterinarian or licensed kennel of the
owner’s choosing. If the court rules that the animal is not dangerous as
defined, it will be released to the owner. If the court rules that it is
dangerous as defined, the animal will be released to the owner after payment of
any fees and penalties, and upon presentation of proof that the animal will now
be kept restrained or confined as specified in this subchapter.
      (2)   If the owner or keeper of any alleged dangerous animal impounded
for violation of this subchapter presents proof that the animal will not be
kept in compliance with this subchapter, the animal will be released upon
payment of any fees and penalties due.
      (3)   If the owner or keeper of an alleged dangerous animal fails to
either provide proof that the animal will now be kept restrained or confined in
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, or fails to reclaim it after
impoundment, and if it cannot be adopted by someone providing proof that it
will be kept restrained or confined as specified in this subchapter, it will be
humanely euthanized.
   (H)   Warning signs. All owners, keepers, or harborers of any guard dog or
dangerous animal shall display in a prominent place on their premises, and at
each entrance or exit to the area where such animal is confined, a sign easily
readable by the public using the words “Beware of Dangerous Animal” or “Beware
of Dog”.

   (A)   Any person who has been pursued or attacked by an allegedly dangerous
animal, or anyone on behalf of such person, may make a complaint before the
Dangerous Animal Officer or District Court, charging the owner, possessor, or
custodian of such animal with harboring a dangerous animal. A copy of such
complaint shall be served upon the person so charged in the same manner and
subject to the laws regulating the service of summons in civil cases, or by any
law enforcement officer of the city with a return receipt, directing such
person to appear before the District Court for a hearing of such complaint at a
time fixed. If upon a hearing of the parties and their witnesses, the court
finds the person so charged is the owner, possessor, or guardian of the animal
in question, and that such animal has without cause, pursued, wounded, or
attacked a human being or other domestic animal, the court shall declare such
animal a dangerous animal and order the owner, possessor, or guardian to
henceforth keep such dangerous animal securely confined as set forth herein,
and impose the penalties set forth in § 91.99.
   (B)   If a subsequent complaint is filed against the same owner, possessor
or guardian for an animal previously determined or found to be a dangerous

immediately remove the animal from the city or order the animal humanely
euthanized.

PROHIBITED ANIMALS
§ 91.30 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The City of Dayton is an urban area with a population living in close
proximity to each other and extensive vehicular traffic.
   (B)   The urban character of the community and the health and safety of its
citizens requires that livestock, poultry and undomesticated and exotic
animals, reptiles or fish be prohibited from the territorial limits of the
city.
   (C)   The keeping of livestock and poultry creates noxious and hazardous
odors and can cause the spread of disease and attracts vexatious and disease
carrying insects and varmints which are detrimental to the health and safety of
the public.
   (D)   The keeping of undomesticated and exotic animals, reptiles or fish, in
addition to creating the same noxious and hazardous conditions associated with
livestock and poultry, creates dangerous and unsafe conditions to persons
residing in proximity to such animals due to attacks, bites, clawing, and other
activities which are instinctive to such animals.
   (E)   The keeping of livestock, poultry, undomesticated and exotic animals,
reptiles or fish within an urban setting constitutes cruelty to such animals in
that said animals require large spaces for their habitats, are instinctively
wary of human contact, and are oblivious to the dangers of urban life such as
vehicular traffic.

provided otherwise in this subchapter.
   (B)   Construction procedures and placement of facilities; obligation to
minimize interference with the right-of-way.
      (1)   All activities in the right-of-way that are subject to this
subchapter shall be performed in compliance with all applicable laws,

subject to this subchapter must obtain all other necessary franchises, permits,
licenses, and authority and pay all fees required by this subchapter or other
applicable rule, law, or regulation.
      (2)   The city may require that facilities be installed at a particular
time, at a specific place or location, or in a particular manner as a condition
of access to a particular right-of-way; the city may deny access if a party is
not willing to comply with the city’s reasonable requirements; and may, unless

removal of facilities are contained in §
96.67. Regardless of any other criteria, in the event the placement or location
of a facility in a particular area of the right-of-way would constitute a

completion of those activities that caused the disturbance or damage by the
party who disturbed or damaged the right-of-way or public property. This time
may be extended by the City Administrator upon a party demonstrating reasonable
cause for the extension. A party’s failure to take reasonable steps to complete
all restoration work due under a surface cut permit within the time period
stated above will result in the cost of the permit fee required pursuant to §
96.71 being re-assessed as an additional fee each time there is a failure to
meet the time limit. Any additional fee(s) shall be assessed at the time of
inspection or re-inspection and payable to the city in addition to the amount
of the original fee(s) provided for in §§
96.71(B) and
96.72(C) of this subchapter.

support structures, and manholes, must be maintained in a safe condition at all
times. In the event any facility in the right-of-way is endangering the public
safety, the party responsible for such facility shall take steps to rectify the

and consistent with the procedures and criteria contained therein, all parties
subject to this subchapter shall, upon the provision of reasonable written
notice of, and at the direction of the City Administrator, promptly relocate or

REGISTRATION; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Requirement to register and pay fees. Unless otherwise excepted by

construct, or maintain any facilities within the right-of-way unless such
facilities are registered with the city by filing the registration statement
required herein and all applicable fees (including franchise fees) are paid to
the city. Any person who installs, operates, constructs, or maintains any
facilities within the right-of-way before registering such facilities or
obtaining the necessary permits, certificates, letters, or other documentation
required pursuant to this subchapter shall not only be required to pay the
initial installation permit fee, surface cut permit fee or pole, tower or
support structure permit required pursuant to §
96.71, but shall also be subject to a reassessment of the installation permit
fee or surface cut permit fee upon discovery that such work has commenced.
   (B)   Registration. Unless otherwise excepted by this subchapter, any party

service provider or a lessee shall not be required to register those facilities
it utilizes those facilities solely for the purpose of reselling, or uses those

equitable title to the right-of-way, nor does it place a registrant in a
position of priority with respect to other registrants. Registration does not
excuse a party from having to obtain a franchise, lease, or other agreement, if
otherwise required, or from obtaining any required or necessary agreement with

   (B)   If the City Administrator determines that the right-of-way associated
with a surface cut has degraded or caved-in more than one-half (1/2) inches
below grade, and within two (2) years after any surface cut, it shall notify
the party or parties responsible for making the surface cut of this
determination and:
      (1)   In the case of a clear and immediate danger or hazard to vehicular
or pedestrian traffic, the city shall order the party or parties responsible to
take immediate precautionary measures to direct vehicular or pedestrian traffic
around and away from the degradation or cave-in. In addition, the city shall
order the party or parties responsible to make all necessary corrections and

      (2)   In all other cases of degradation or cave-in the city shall order
the party or parties responsible to take immediate precautionary measures to
direct vehicular or pedestrian traffic around and away from the degradation or

fees is not paid by the responsible party within forty-five (45) days, the City
Administrator shall suspend the issuance of all future permits to the
responsible party until such time as the costs are paid.
      (4)   This section shall not be interpreted to preclude the city from
taking any and all reasonable protective measures with respect to the right-of-
way and the health and safety of the general public, including but not limited
to blocking the general public’s access to the area, temporarily repairing the
right-of-way, or removing any facility that constitutes an immediate health or
safety concern. The city shall not undertake to repair or remove a facility
unless all other reasonable methods of response to the emergency have been
exercised.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.64 INSURANCE.
   Unless otherwise provided in a valid franchise agreement or interlocal
agreement with the city, each registrant shall procure and maintain the

agents, boards, consultants, assigns, volunteers and successors in interest.”
         (b)   Registrant’s insurance coverage shall be primary insurance with
respect to the city. Any insurance or self-insurance maintained by the city
shall be in excess of the registrant’s insurance and shall not contribute to
it.

canceled by either party, reduced in coverage or in limits except after thirty
(30) days prior written notice to the city.

(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.65 INDEMNIFICATION; HOLD HARMLESS.
   Unless otherwise prohibited by law or otherwise provided in a valid
franchise agreement or interlocal agreement with the city:
   (A)   Each registrant shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the city,
its officials, boards, members, agents, and employees against any and all
claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or
equitable relief, and costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees
and court costs, arising from liability or claims of liability for bodily
injury or death to persons or property damage in which the claim arises out of
the installation, construction, repair, maintenance, or operation of its
facilities, and in the event of a final judgment entered against the city,
either independently or jointly with the registrant, the registrant shall pay
such judgment and all costs and hold the city harmless thereon.
   (B)   The city shall notify the registrant in writing within a reasonable
time of receiving notice of any issue it determines may require indemnification
and the registrant shall defend the city at the cost of the registrant.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.66 JOINT PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION; COORDINATION OF EXCAVATION.
   (A)   Any registrant owning, operating, or installing facilities in the
right-of-way that provide water, sewer, gas, electric, telephony,
telecommunications, internet, cable, video, or other utility services shall
prepare and submit to the City Administrator, a master plan to the extent it
has planned future activity as defined herein. Registrants shall submit an
initial master plan no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the
effective date of this subchapter. Thereafter, each such registrant shall
submit annually, as required by the City Administrator, a revised and updated
master plan. As used in this division (A), the term “MASTER PLAN” refers to a
document reflecting any known future activity planned by the registrant to
occur within one (1) year after its submission that would also require the
issuance of a surface-cut permit.
   (B)   The City Administrator shall keep all master plans confidential in
accordance with the provisions of the Kentucky Open Records Act, KRS 61.870 et
seq., and shall establish procedures to ensure that said master plans are
utilized and inspected only for the purposes intended by this subchapter.
   (C)   Prior to applying for a surface-cut permit, a party shall contact the
City Administrator and coordinate, to the extent practicable, with each
registrant to minimize damage to and avoid undue disruption and interference
with the public use of the right-of-way.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.67 INSTALLATION, RELOCATION, OR REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Provisions apply unless direct conflict exists. The provisions of this
section shall apply unless they directly conflict with a tariff, state or
federal law, or the provisions of the applicant’s franchise agreement or
interlocal agreement with the city.
   (B)   General application. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, upon the
written notice of and at the direction of the City Administrator, a registrant
shall relocate or remove facilities, or rearrange aerial facilities, if
required by a tariff, state or federal law, a franchise agreement with the
city, or the City Administrator in exercising his or her authority under this
section.
   (C)   Coordination. Registrants are encouraged to coordinate the
installation, relocation, or removal of their facilities with each other to
avoid issues with respect to the location of facilities within the right-of-
way.
   (D)   Appeal. Any party aggrieved by a determination of the City
Administrator with respect to the installation, relocation, or removal of a
facility may appeal such decision pursuant to §
96.75.
   (E)   Installation.
      (1)   Definition. For purposes of this section, the term “INSTALL”,
“INSTALLED”, or “INSTALLATION” shall mean placement of new facilities within
the right-of-way, including the replacement of existing facilities and the
installation and collocation of small wireless facilities. An installation
requires the issuance of an installation permit or surface-cut permit.
      (2)   Procedure. The City Administrator shall notify the applicant if the
City Administrator determines that a facility may not be installed as requested
by the applicant. Upon determining that a facility may not be installed as
requested, the City Administrator shall provide written notice to the applicant
as early as practicable and in conformity with any specific applicable notice
requirement. The notice shall contain a description of the area affected as
well as the reason for the City Administrator’s determination. The City
Administrator may issue a permit that is contingent upon certain condition(s)
being fulfilled with respect to the criteria contained below.
      (3)   Criteria. A decision by the city to deny an installation permit or
surface-cut permit application must be based on at least one (1) of the
following criteria:
         (a)   It significantly conflicts with the location of existing
facilities or facilities that are planned or permitted for installation, or
city improvements or facilities that are planned in that area;
         (b)   It significantly conflicts with the timing of other ongoing
activity taking place in the same area of the right-of-way, or with a
previously scheduled activity;
         (c)   It conflicts with the planned grading, re-grading, construction,
reconstruction, widening or altering of any right-of-way or the construction,
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or alteration of a public improvement,
including, but not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and streetlights;
         (d)   It conflicts with an approved development plan in that
geographic area that requires all or certain types of facilities to be located
in certain locations, areas, or parts of the right-of-way;
         (e)   It is an above-ground facility other than a fire hydrant or
other city-owned facility, which because of its size presents significant
public-safety concerns or violates guidelines or procedures pertaining to
aesthetics found in §
96.68 or as otherwise duly authorized by Council or the City Administrator;
         (f)   It fails to take reasonable measures to disguise or cover the
facility as required by the city pursuant to guidelines or procedures
pertaining to aesthetics found in § 96.68 or as otherwise duly authorized by
Council or the City Administrator;
         (g)   It conflicts with a requirement contained in the applicant’s
franchise agreement or interlocal agreement;
         (h)   It is located in a type of right-of-way, such as a bicycle lane
or path, in which the city has determined that facilities are not to be
installed;
         (i)   It would threaten public health, safety, or welfare or otherwise
constitute a violation of the provisions of this subchapter; or
         (j)   The applicant is not otherwise in material compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter.
      (4)   Reservation of rights. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
subchapter, the city specifically reserves the right to order the removal or
relocation of any facility installed after the effective date of this
subchapter, at no cost to the city, for which an installation permit or
surface-cut permit was not obtained.
      (5)   Preclusion on cutting newly paved surfaces. If any street is about
to be resurfaced by the city, on advance written notice from the City
Administrator pursuant to §
96.67(C), the registrant shall make any extensions, changes, or installations
of or to its facilities ahead of such activity. Registrant shall notify the
City Administrator by July 15 of its desire to perform such extensions,
changes, or installations, and may be allowed up to ninety (90) additional days
to complete the work. If any street is about to be constructed, reconstructed,
widened, altered, or paved by the city, upon receipt of final plans from the
City Administrator, the registrant shall make any extensions, changes, or
installations of or to its facilities ahead of such activity. Depending on the
amount of such extensions, changes, or installations to be performed, the
registrant may be allowed up to one hundred twenty (120) days to complete the
work. If the registrant fails to do such extensions, changes, or installations,
it shall be precluded for a period of one (1) year from disturbing such paving
without the express permission of the City Administrator. The City
Administrator shall only grant such permission upon a sufficient showing by the
registrant that undue hardship would be caused if the registrant were not
allowed to disturb the pavement and that it shall satisfactorily comply with
all other relevant provisions of this subchapter, including the requirements
contained in §
96.73(A) pertaining to resurfacing.
   (F)   Relocations. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the city shall have
the ability to order the relocation of any facility located within the right-
of-way. The city shall not normally direct the exact location where that the
facility is to be relocated, but instead shall work with the registrant or
permittee as part of the permitting process. There shall be no fee associated
with a permit required as a result of a relocation ordered by the city.
      (1)   Public projects. Whenever the city decides to grade, regrade,
construct, reconstruct, widen or alter any right-of-way or construct,
reconstruct, repair, maintain, or alter a public improvement, including, but
not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and street lights, it shall be
the duty of the registrant, when so ordered by the city, to change and relocate
its facilities in the right-of-way at no cost to the city so as to conform to
the established grade or line of such right-of-way so as not to interfere with
such public improvements. However, notwithstanding the above, if as part of
said public improvement the city orders that facilities previously and lawfully
located above-ground to be relocated underground, the city shall bear the cost
for the difference in cost between an aerial and underground facility of the
same type, unless an agreement to the contrary is otherwise entered into by the
appropriate parties.
      (2)   Relocation for public safety reasons. If the basis for the city
ordering the relocation of a facility is a public-safety concern, the
registrant shall relocate the facility at no cost to the city.
      (3)   Relocations to assist in the placement of other facilities. If the
basis for the city ordering the relocation of a facility is to assist in the
installation of facilities by another registrant or permittee, the party
seeking to install the facilities shall bear the costs of said relocation,
unless an agreement is otherwise reached.
      (4)   Relocations where the cost is borne by the city. Notwithstanding
any language in this subchapter to the contrary, unless an agreement to the
contrary is otherwise entered into by the appropriate parties, the cost of the
following types of relocations shall be borne by the city:
         (a)   If the reason the city is ordering the relocation is because it
has adopted a plan or policy requiring that facilities be placed underground in
that location, if, at the time the facility was installed, such a plan was not
in place;
         (b)   If at the time the facility was installed, the location in which
the facility is currently sited was not a part of the right-of-way or was not
otherwise owned or controlled by the city;
         (c)   If the city has already ordered that the facility be relocated
to comply with a public improvement project, the registrant or party has
substantially complied with such order, and the city then orders the registrant
or party to relocate that facility to a different area as part of the same
project; or
         (d)   If the city orders the relocation of a facility to accommodate a
public-improvement project and the construction of such project is subsequently
terminated by the Council.
   (G)   Removal.
      (1)   If the city requites a facility that is no longer being used to
provide service, as defined below, to be taken out of the right-of-way, such
removal shall be pursuant to the requirements of this division (G). However,
abandoned sewer and water facilities shall not be required to be removed, but
shall be required to be filled and capped.
      (2)   Definition. A facility shall be considered to be “NO LONGER IN USE”
if such facility has not been used to provide service or support the provision
of service for a period of one (1) year, or the registrant or the party
responsible for the facility has notified the City Administrator that it no
longer intends to use the facility. If the city determines that a facility is
“NO LONGER IN USE based on the fact that it has not been used for a period of
more than one (1) year, the responsible party may petition the City
Administrator for a reasonable extension of time based on that party’s desire
to use the facility to provide service or to sell or transfer such facility
within a reasonable amount of time. Such an extension of time shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
      (3)   Procedure for notification. Any party discontinuing use of a
facility shall notify the City Administrator in writing of such discontinued
use within thirty (30) days. This notice shall describe the facilities for
which the use is to be discontinued and include a statement as to whether the
registrant intends to leave the facilities in place for potential future use,
remove the facilities, or abandon the facilities in place. The registrant shall
remain responsible for the maintenance, repair, and condition of discontinued
facilities at all times after its discontinuance.
      (4)   Criteria and procedure for removal. Upon providing reasonable
advanced written notice to the registrant or other responsible party, the City
Administrator may order the removal of any facility that has been determined to
be “NO LONGER IN USE, if any of the following arise with respect to that
facility:
         (a)   It significandy conflicts with the location of existing
facilities or facilities that are planned or permitted for installation, or
city improvements or facilities that are planned in that area;
         (b)   It conflicts with the planned grading, re-grading, construction,
reconstruction, widening or altering of any right-of-way or the construction,
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or alteration of a public improvement,
including, but not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and streetlights;
         (c)   It conflicts with an approved development plan in that
geographic area that requires all or certain types of facilities to be located
in certain locations, areas, or parts of the right-of-way;
         (d)   It conflicts with a requirement contained in that party’s
franchise agreement or interlocal agreement;
         (e)   The current location of the facility threatens public health,
safety, or welfare or otherwise constitutes a violation of the provisions of
this subchapter; or
         (f)   It is an above-ground facility that has been determined to be
“NO LONGER IN USE” for a period of more than ninety (90) days.
      (5)   Facilities located underground. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
city shall not order the removal of any underground facility unless the surface
above the facility is currently being, or will be, substantially excavated, or
the presence of that facility causes an emergency or threatens public health,
safety, or welfare. In any event, the removal of such a facility shall be
limited to that portion of the facility that actually presents an issue.
      (6)   Cost of removal. The city shall not bear any portion of the cost of
the removal of any facility or filling and capping water or sewer facilities,
unless it is part of a city project, and the costs of such removal (or filling
and capping) are minimal. Depending on the circumstances, the City
Administrator may order that the party responsible for such facility, the party
seeking a permit, or both, bear the costs and the responsibility of such
removal (or filling and capping). However, in the event that the facility is
being removed to accommodate the placement of a non-city facility, the cost of
such removal shall be the responsibility of the party or parties applying for
the permit, so long as the existing facility was lawfully installed.
      (7)   In the event the registrant or other responsible party elects to
abandon the facility in place and the Council approves such abandonment, the
registrant or party shall convey full title and ownership of such abandoned
facility to the city in consideration of the abandonment in place and without
the need of the city to pay compensation to the registrant, except as otherwise
provided by applicable law. The registrant shall, however, continue to be
responsible for all taxes on such facilities or other liabilities associated
therewith, until the date the same is conveyed to the city.
      (8)   Should any registrant or other responsible party fail, after
notice, to remove a facility (or in in the case of water or sewer facilities,
fill and cap abandoned facilities) upon the order of the City Administrator as
specified in this section, the city may, at its option and in addition to the
imposition of any other remedies hereunder or in a franchise agreement or
interlocal agreement with that party, undertake or cause to be undertaken, the
removal of the facility. The city shall have no liability for any damage caused
by such removal and the registrant or other responsible party shall be liable
to the city for all reasonable costs incurred by the city in such removal.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.68 AESTHETIC STANDARDS.
   Unless otherwise approved by the city to prevent an effective prohibition of
service in accordance with federal regulations, as applicable, no person shall
locate or maintain a new facility, pole, tower, or support structure, except in
accordance with the following design standards:
   (A)   All facilities shall be located and designed so as to minimize visual
impact on surrounding properties and from public right-of-way.
   (B)   All new or replacement poles, towers, or support structures placed in
the right-of-way shall be the same color, shape, material, and general height
as those existing poles or towers adjacent to the location of the new or
replacement pole, tower, or support structure.
   (C)   All coaxial, fiber-optic, or other cabling and wires shall be
contained inside any new or replacement tower, pole, or other support structure
to the extent technically and commercially feasible. On existing poles or
support structures, or new wooden poles, where it is impossible or infeasible
to place wiring inside the pole or support structure, all coaxial, fiber-optic,
or other cabling and wires shall be flush-mounted and covered with a metal,
plastic, or similar material, which, to the extent feasible, shall match the
color of the pole or support structure. AU coaxial, fiber-optic, or other
cabling and wires shall be contained inside any new tower or pole placed in the
right-of-way to the extent technically and commercially feasible.
   (D)   No tower shall be placed in the right-of-way within two hundred fifty
(250) feet on the same street of an existing tower. Replacing an existing tower
with a tower, or a lighted pole with another lighted pole housing wireless
facilities, in the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (E)   All new towers and poles should be located on the same side of the
street as existing towers, poles, or support structures. However, this does not
preclude an applicant from locating its wireless facilities on existing lighted
poles under a decommissioning agreement in which the applicant takes ownership
of the lighted pole.
   (F)   The centerline of any new pole or tower shall be aligned with the
centerline of adjacent poles or trees unless the new structure’s height
conflicts with overhead power utility lines. Replacing an existing pole,
support structure, or tower with another pole, support structure, or tower in
the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (G)   All new poles, towers, or facilities proposed to be fronting a
dwelling shall be placed on property lines, unless it would obstruct sight
distance at driveways or other accesses to roadways. In those instances where
placement of a new pole or tower or facilities on the property line would
obstruct sight distance, the pole or tower or facilities shall be placed in
such a location as to prevent the obstruction of sight distance at driveways or
other access points to roadways. Replacing an existing pole, support structure,
tower, or facility with a new pole, support structure, tower, or facility in
the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (H)   New poles, towers, or facilities shall not be placed in front of store
front windows, walkways, entrances, or exits, or in such a way that would
impede deliveries. Replacing an existing pole, support structure, tower, or
facility with a new pole, support structure, tower, or facility in the same
location shall not violate this provision.
   (I)   No new poles or towers shall be placed in front of driveways,
entrances, or walkways. Replacing an existing pole, support structure, or tower
with a pole, support structure, or tower in the same location shall not violate
this provision.
   (J)   No applicant shall locate or maintain a pole, support structure,
tower, or equipment associated with a wireless facility in a manner that
interferes with the health of a tree.
   (K)   In areas where the undergrounding of utilities are located, but
lighted poles are present, the applicant shall locate its wireless facilities
on existing lighted poles or seek to decommission the lighted pole to replace
it with a lighted pole to house its wireless facilities. However, an applicant
must consider the aesthetics of the existing utilities and neighborhoods
adjacent to a proposed wireless facility location prior to submitting an
application. Applicants shall consider and make best efforts to match the
existing, adjacent streetscape character. Also, when a wireless facility is
proposed to be installed within Central Business District in Dayton, the
applicant must consider and propose infrastructure that most closely matches
adjacent themed infrastructure to the maximum extent feasible. The
characteristics of unique assemblies may include mast arms, decorative pole
bases, architectural luminaires, mounting heights, pole colors, and the like.
   (L)   If the applicant elects to decommission an existing lighted pole to
install a wireless facility in its location, the applicant shall comply with
this subchapter, including these aesthetic standards and any decommissioning
agreement between the applicant, the city, and Kentucky Utilities, or its
equivalent.
   (M)   In those locations where the underground utilities are located, all
new facilities shall be placed underground.
   (N)   No equipment associated with any facility, including guide wires,
shall impede, obstruct, or hinder ADA access, or pedestrian or vehicular
access, or block driveways, entrances, or walkways. The installation of new
ground furniture is prohibited.
   (O)   To protect the health and safety of the public from the harms of noise
pollution, all facilities shall have a low-noise profile.
   (P)   Within twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date the operator
receives notice thereof, operator shall remove all graffiti on any of its
facilities located in the right-of-way.
   (Q)   All facilities, poles, towers, and support structures shall comply
with such additional design standards as may be set forth in any written
policies or guidelines issued by the city.
   (R)   All poles, towers, support structures, and other lines and equipment
installed or erected by registrant under this subchapter shall be located so as
to minimize any interference with the proper use of the right-of-way with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners whose property adjoins or
abuts any affected right-of-way. Subject to applicable codes, overhead drops
shall be as close as possible to other utility drops to concentrate the drops
in as small an area as possible to minimize visual clutter and interference
with the use of private property.
   (S)   In areas already served by overhead utilities within an alley,
wireless facilities must also be located in the alley. No wireless facilities
will be permitted in front of residential properties if the area does not
currently have overhead utilities or streetlights along the right-of-way
frontage. Relief from this requirement will require a written statement from
the utility owning the existing poles within the alley that said poles will not
accommodate the proposed facilities.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.69 POLES, TOWERS, AND SUPPORT STRUCTURES.
   (A)   To the extent possible, registrants shall use existing poles, towers,
support structures, and conduit existing at the time of permitting in
installing their facilities.
   (B)   All poles, towers, support structures, or wire holding structures are
subject to any applicable, duly adopted regulations regarding location, height,
type, or other pertinent aspect, including those found in §
96.68.
   (C)   All transmission and distribution structures, poles, towers, support
structures, and other lines and equipment installed or erected by registrant
under this subchapter shall be located to minimize any interference with the
proper use of the right-of-way with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners whose property adjoins or abuts any affected right-of-way.
Subject to applicable codes, overhead drops shall be as close as possible to
other Utility drops in order to concentrate the drops in as small an area as
possible to minimize visual clutter and interference with the use of private
property.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.70 PERMITS REQUIRED; NOTICE OF ACTIVITIES; EXCEPTIONS; DENIALS.
   Unless otherwise exempted by this subchapter, any party performing an
activity within the right-of-way that requires a permit pursuant to this
subchapter must obtain the applicable permit prior to the performance of such
activity and pay any applicable permit fee.
   (A)   (1)   Each time a registrant is performing any of the activities
listed below, it shall provide written notification to the city. Text messages
shall not be considered written notice. Any work performed without proper
written notification shall constitute work being done without a permit and
subject to the levy of fines. Activities requiring written notification to the
city are:
         (a)   Installation or replacement of wiring on existing towers,
support structures, or poles when the work (i) necessitates presence in the
right-of-way for more than one (1) day, or (ii) involves more than one thousand
(1,000) line feet of cable or wire;
         (b)   Replacement of existing towers, support structures, or poles
when the work (i) necessitates presence in the right-of-way for more than two
(2) days, or (ii) involves more than one thousand (1,000) line feet of cable or
wire;
         (c)   Excavations of existing facilities from ten (10) to twenty-five
(25) square feet with no street or sidewalk cuts;
         (d)   Installation of new underground lines in trenches of less than
two hundred fifty (250) linear feet with a width of six (6) inches or less and
with no street, curb, apron, or sidewalk cuts;
         (e)   Installation of new underground lines in trenches of fifty (50)
linear feet or less with a width of twenty-four (24) inches or less and with no
street, curb, apron, or sidewalk cuts;
         (f)   An underground boring larger than three (3) inches in diameter;
or
         (g)   Any underground boring located under a paved street.
      (2)   The notification shall consist of, at a minimum, the name of the
registrant, a general description of the location (by address(es) or street
(s)), and the nature or type of the activity performed (e.g., installation of
wiring, boring, tower/support structure/pole replacement, and the like). Said
notification may be provided in writing via e-mail to the City Administrator or
his or her designee. Notwithstanding the above, permits shall not be required
for inspections, CCTV inspections, or clearing debris from facilities.
   (B)   An installation permit or a surface-cut permit for the performance of
non-emergency work shall be applied for at least ten (10) days prior to such
planned activity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Administrator may
waive said time period for good cause shown. The City Administrator must
approve, deny, or conditionally approve a permit application within five (5)
business days of the receipt of the application and in the case of a
conditional approval or denial, state in writing the basis for such
determination and what conditions must be met by the applicant to obtain a
permit. The failure of the City Administrator to respond to an installation
permit within five (5) business days shall constitute approval of the permit.
Any work performed without proper notification shall constitute work being done
without a permit and subject to the levy of fines.
   (C)   A permit issued pursuant to an emergency shall be applied for no later
than five (5) business days after the discovery of the emergency.
   (D)   All applications for permits shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The identity and legal status of the applicant (the party to whom
the permit is issued).
      (2)   The name, address, and telephone number of the officer, agent or
employee requesting the permit.
      (3)   A description of all activities covered by the permit, and in the
case of an installation permit or a surface-cut permit, the locations and
estimated dates and times of commencement and completion thereof.
      (4)   The number of all surface cuts covered by the surface-cut permit,
and the number of square feet of right-of-way surface to be removed; or the
number of linear feet included in the installation.
   (E)   A single permit may be issued for multiple surface cuts or
installations, provided that no such surface cut or installation covered in a
single permit shall be more than three hundred (300) feet apart.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Administrator may grant a single permit
for multiple surface cuts or installations that are more than three hundred
(300) feet upon a showing by the permit applicant that such an expansion of
activity shall not significantly affect the City Administrator’s ability to
efficiently administer this subchapter.
   (F)   Notification of inspections. If the City Administrator knows at the
time of the issuance of the permit that it shall require an inspection(s), it
will notify the permittee that such an inspection(s) is required.
   (G)   Denial or revocation. The City Administrator, in his or her reasonable
discretion, may deny or revoke a permit for failure to satisfy the material
requirements and conditions of this subchapter, including but not limited to
the criteria contained in §
96.68 or if the denial is otherwise necessary to protect the health, safety,
and welfare of the citizens of the city. In addition, the City Administrator
may issue a permit that is contingent upon the applicant performing certain
requirements that shall be specified in the permit.
   (H)   Exceptions.
      (1)   Permits are not required to be obtained pursuant to this subchapter
if the facilities involved are of the following nature:
         (a)   Newspaper stands;
         (b)   Signage;
         (c)   Facilities associated with sidewalk cafes or the sale of goods
or merchandise; and
         (d)   Facilities owned by the city.
      (2)   However, the party responsible for such facilities is required to
comply with all remaining provisions of this subchapter as well as any other
ordinance that may apply, unless otherwise exempted.

§ 96.71 PERMIT FEES; CREDITS; DISPLAY.
   (A)   Installation permit. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, every party
obtaining an installation permit shall pay a fee of one hundred dollars
($100.00) for each installation permit. Any immediately adjoining real property
owner cited to replace, repair, restore, or otherwise maintain any sidewalk,
curb, apron, or utility strip for which that real property owner is legally
responsible shall be exempt from paying any fees for obtaining an installation
permit for these activities. This fee shall be reassessed in the event that at
any work commences without approval as provided in §
96.67(A).
   (B)   Surface cut permit. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, every party
obtaining a surface-cut permit shall pay a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
for each surface-cut permit. This fee shall be re-assessed each time a party
fails to comply with §
96.56(B)(4), or in the event that any work commences without approval as
provided in §
96.58(A).
   (C)   New pole, tower, or support structure permit. Unless otherwise
prohibited by law, every party obtaining a pole, tower or support structure
permit shall pay a fee of two hundred seventy dollars ($270.00) for each new
pole, tower, or support structure permit. This fee shall be reassessed each
time a party fails to comply with §
96.56(B)(4), or in the event that any work commences without approval as
provided in §
96.58(A).
   (D)   The installation permit fees, surface-cut permit fees and pole, tower
and support structure permit fees required by this section shall be paid at the
time of application for the permit unless such fees have been paid in
accordance with division (A) above.
   (E)   Permit display. Permits issued pursuant to this subchapter shall be
conspicuously displayed or otherwise available at all times at the indicated
work site and shall be available for inspection by the City Administrator or
other city employees or officials upon request.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.72 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Unless otherwise prohibited by law or otherwise provided in a valid
franchise agreement or interlocal agreement with the city, to ensure
performance, each registrant seeking a surface-cut permit must establish a
performance bond in favor of the city to be issued by an entity subject to
jurisdiction and venue in the city in an amount to be determined by the City
Administrator in consultation with the City Engineer, which shall be in effect
for and cover all surface cuts made by that party for a period of two (2) years
after the final inspection and approval of the surface cut by the City
Administrator. There shall be recoverable, jointly, and severally, from the
principal and surety of the bond, any damages or losses suffered by the city as
a result, including the full amount of any right-of-way repair, compensation,
indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the
registrant, plus attorney’s fees and court costs, up to the full amount of the
bond.
   (B)   The bond shall contain the following endorsement:
      “It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by
the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until thirty
(30) days after receipt by the City of Dayton, via registered mail, a written
notice of such intent to cancel or not to renew.”
   (C)   In no event shall the amount required by the City Administrator for
the performance bond exceed the reasonable costs of repairing the activity
affiliated with the surface-cut permits. This provision shall not apply to the
city. In lieu of a performance bond, the City Administrator may allow the
applicant for a surface-cut permit to deposit with the City Administrator an
amount appropriate to cover the city’s cost of repairing the surface cut; to be
held for a similar period. The city reserves the right to impose additional
security requirements as part of any surface-cut permit or franchise agreement.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.73 PATCHING AND RESTORATION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Standards. Patching and restoration of the right-of-way shall be
performed according to the applicable standards and with the materials
specified by the City Administrator, and at a minimum shall comply with the
applicable standard engineering drawing. The City Administrator shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis in
accordance with the criteria listed below. All edges of a surface cut made to a
paved street must be sawed and such surface cuts must be sealed with a sealant
approved by the City Administrator. In addition, the City Administrator must
approve all backfill material utilized. In most instances, the minimum
standards will apply. However, in certain limited instances, the City
Administrator may determine that the minimum standards do not adequately
protect the city because of at least one (1) of the following considerations:
      (1)   The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions, or damage to the right-of-way;
      (2)   The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way;
      (3)   The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way;
      (4)   The remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the
excavation; or
      (5)   The surface cut was made in violation of §
96.67(E)(5).
   (B)   Replacement with similar materials. Every cut, excavation, or
alteration to a street, sidewalk, or other right-of-way shall be fully repaired
and restored to substantially same condition with the same type of materials as
before this work was done. Concrete, including stamped or colored concrete,
must be replaced with similar concrete; hot asphalt installations must be
replaced hot asphalt, not cold-mix asphalt; and brick pavers must be replaced
with brick pavers of similar type, including historic pavers that are the same
size and weight of those removed during construction. However, if the
excavation work is located in an area where past repair work was done and the
previously placed material in this excavation area is different than the
surrounding area — such as an asphalt patch installed in a concrete street or
in the middle of brick pavers — the excavation must be restored using the same
type of material found in surrounding area, i.e., concrete, brick pavers, and
the like.
   (C)   Guarantees. Each party performing excavations pursuant to a permit
required by this subchapter guarantees its restoration work and shall maintain
it for two (2) years following its completion. During this period, it shall,
upon notification from the City Administrator, correct all restoration work to
the extent necessary, using the method required by the City Administrator.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.74 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Site inspection. Any party issued a permit pursuant to this subchapter
shall make the worksite available to the City Administrator and to all others
as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the
execution of and upon completion of the work. No excavation shall be covered
until it has been inspected and approved by the City Administrator if the City
Administrator has given that party notice of its intent to inspect the
excavation. The permittee shall provide the City Administrator with advance
notice of at least one (1) day when the appropriate portion of the activity is
ready for inspection, and if the City Administrator fails to inspect after
being provided such notice, the permittee may continue to perform the permitted
activity. Any excavation that has been covered without a required approval or
inspection shall be uncovered for inspection at that party’s expense, upon
request of the City Administrator. If the construction or restoration does not
meet the standards under this subchapter, the City Administrator may order
corrective measures.
   (B)   Authority of the City Administrator.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the City Administrator may order the
immediate cessation of any work that he or she in good faith believes poses a
serious threat to the life, health, safety, or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The City Administrator may issue an order to the permittee for any
work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable
ordinance, resolution, regulation, standard, condition, or code. The order
shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation
of the permit. The permittee shall proceed with the corrective work before
undertaking any additional work under the permit. Within ten (10) days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the City
Administrator that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the requited time, the City Administrator may revoke the
permit, or for good cause shown, extend the period of time allowed for the
corrective work to be completed.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.75 APPEAL.
   Any party that:
   (A)   Has been denied registration after the reconsideration process
provided for in §
96.61;
   (B)   Has been denied a permit or has been issued a conditional permit for
which the party disagrees with certain of the condition(s) imposed;
   (C)   Is aggrieved by a decision pertaining to installation, relocation, or
removal of a facility pursuant to §
96.67;
   (D)   Has had a permit revoked; or
   (E)   Believes that the fees imposed are invalid;
may have such action reviewed, upon written request, by the City Administrator
or his or her designee, who shall act within a period of ten (10) days from the
receipt of the written request. The appealing party shall be afforded the
opportunity to be heard and present relevant evidence to the City Administrator
should it desire to do so, and the decision by the City Administrator, which
shall be the final administrative decision on the request subject to appeal to
court, shall be in writing and provide the basis for the decision. Nothing in
this subchapter shall prevent a party from filing at any time a legal action in
any permissible court or tribunal seeking a declaration or enforcement of the
party’s rights or obligations under this subchapter or its franchise agreement.
(Ord. 2022-27, passed 12-6-22)
§ 96.76 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a
registrant and if the vacation does not require the relocation of registrant’s
facilities, the city shall reserve, to and for itself and all registrants
having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain
and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such
right-of-way at any time for the purpose of adding additional facilities,
expanding existing service, or replacing, reconstructing, inspecting,
maintaining, or repairing the same.

§ 96.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, firm, corporation, or titled owner who violates a
provision of this chapter shall be subject to a civil fine of not less than one
hundred dollar ($100) per day, per violation, but not more than five hundred
dollars ($500) per day per violation, or the cost to the City of Dayton to
abate the violation, or both. Each date that a violation of this chapter
continues after due notice has been served pursuant to provisions of this
chapter of the City of Dayton Code of Ordinances ("the code") shall be deemed a
separate offense, up to a maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) per
citation.
   (B)   As an additional alternative remedy to the above-referenced penalty,
any person who has been previously issued two (2) or more citations for code
violations related to the same property within a twelve (12) month period may
be assessed additional civil penalties of five hundred dollars ($500) per day
per violation up to a maximum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per citation.
   (C)   The City of Dayton shall possess a lien on this property for all
fines, penalties, charges, attorney's fees, and other reasonable costs
associated with enforcing this chapter and/or placing of a lien on the parcel
of real property subject to the provisions of this Subchapter. The lien shall
be superior to and have priority over all other subsequently filed liens,
except state, county, school board, and city taxes. Pursuant to KRS 65.8834,
the city may elect to include the amount of any unpaid lien that has been
recorded pursuant to KRS 65.8835 on any city property tax bill for the
property.

violation of this Chapter with respect to the structure presents a serious
threat to the public health, safety, and welfare; or
      (2)   The structure is so old, dilapidated, or has become so out of
repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human
habitation or occupancy, or demolition is otherwise reasonably necessary to
protect the public interest.
   (B)   Order. The order shall specify necessary repairs, if any, and a time
in which the owner shall comply therewith, which shall be no less than 30 days
unless an emergency exists pursuant to section (A)(1). It shall be served on

be demolished by the city, or when an imminent danger exists that will not

agency or by contract or arrangement with private persons, and the cost of such
razing and removal, together with related expenses, costs, fees, and attorney
fees to the extent provided by law, shall be charged against the owner of the

surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,

defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any

(Ord. 2023-3, passed 6-6-23)
§ 110.07 APPORTIONMENT OF GROSS RECEIPTS IN CALCULATING FEE DUE.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) below, gross receipts shall be
apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the gross receipts by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) below, plus
the sales factor, described in division (C) below, and the denominator of which
shall be two.
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the gross receipts by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) below.
      (3)   For the purpose of divisions (A) through (E) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the city.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of gross receipts. The city must approve any
alternate apportionment method prior to its implementation by the business
entity. Once an alternate apportionment method is approved by the city, the
business entity must apply such apportionment scheme in all future tax years,
unless otherwise directed by the city.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license fee shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license fee shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this division,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license fee imposed in this chapter is assessed against gross receipts before
it is "passed through" these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license fee shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government and shall employ the same methods of accounting required for
federal income tax purposes.
   (H)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses it charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation or business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat or excuse the requirement to file returns nor the assessment and
collection any occupational license fee for the period of that taxable year
during which the business entity had business activity in the city.
(Ord. 2023-3, passed 6-6-23)
§ 110.08 EMPLOYERS SHALL WITHHOLD FEE.

required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold a fee under this
section shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file
on a form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the

employees. Either copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and
tax statements, or a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent
information, as determined by the city, shall be submitted.

   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this section shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any fee required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the fee becomes or became
obligated.
   (I)   Notwithstanding division (H) above, every employee receiving
compensation in the city subject to the fee imposed under §
110.06 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the fee levied under this chapter from the employee,
such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the city each
quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer.

maintained by the business entity.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license fee governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns, and comply with rules and regulations as the city
from time to time may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city

a return, render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems
sufficient to determine the fee liability of the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness

persons or business entities that are not employees.
   (G)   If the time for filing a return is extended, the business entity shall
pay, as part of the fee, an amount equal to 12% per annum simple interest on

(Ord. 2023-3, passed 6-6-23)
§ 110.10 EXTENSIONS OF FILING TIME.
   The city may grant any business entity an extension of not more than six
months for filing its return unless a longer extension has been granted by the

before the date prescribed for payment of the occupational license fee,
requests the extension and pays the amount properly estimated as its fee. All

of 2022.
(Ord. 2022-21, passed 9-6-22)
§ 117.02 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   The Dayton City Council does hereby find that:
   (A)   Exposure to exhaled cigarette smoke, e-cigarette aerosol, and other
tobacco-related emissions is harmful to health:
      (1)   The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General’s Report, The Health Consequences of
Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, concluded that (1) secondhand-smoke
exposure causes disease and premature death in children and adults who do not
smoke; (2) children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory problems, ear
infections, and asthma attacks, and that smoking by parents causes respiratory
symptoms and slows lung growth in their children; (3) exposure of adults to
secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and
causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer; and (4) there is no risk-free
level of exposure to secondhand smoke.(1)
      (2)   The 2010 U.S. Surgeon General’s Report, How Tobacco Smoke Causes
Disease, states that even occasional exposure to secondhand smoke is harmful
and low levels of exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke can lead to a rapid and
sharp increase in dysfunction and inflammation of the lining of the blood
vessels, which are implicated in heart attacks and stroke.(2)
      (3)   According to the 2014 U.S. Surgeon General’s Report, The Health
Consequences of Smoking——50 Years of Progress, secondhand smoke exposure causes
stroke in nonsmokers, and that exposure to secondhand smoke causes an estimated
41,000 deaths each year among adults in the United States.(3)
      (4)   Emissions from electronic smoking devices (ESDs), commonly referred
to as electronic cigarettes, or “e-cigarettes,” are made up of a high
concentration of ultrafine particles, and the particle concentration is higher
than in conventional tobacco cigarette smoke.(4) Human lung cells that are
exposed to ESD aerosol and flavorings show increased oxidative stress and
inflammatory responses.(5) The World Health Organization (WHO), the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the American
Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) recommend that ESDs not be used in smoke-
free environments to minimize the risk to bystanders of breathing in the
aerosol emitted by the devices and to avoid undermining the enforcement of
smoke-free laws.(6)
      (5)   In a study of a hookah lounge in Lexington, Kentucky, secondhand
smoke from waterpipe smoking created high fine particulate concentrations,
three to six times the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for outdoor air—a
Clean Air Act limit on pollution.(7)
   (B)   Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke pose significant costs for
businesses and the economy:
      (1)   Secondhand smoke costs the U.S. economy $5.6 billion annually in
lost productivity?(8)
   (C)   Comprehensive, 100% smoke-free laws do not harm business:
      (1)   The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General’s Report, The Health Consequences of
Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, has concluded that evidence from peer-
reviewed studies shows that smoke-free policies and laws do not have an adverse
economic impact on the hospitality industry.(????)
   (D)   Comprehensive, 100% smoke-free laws are necessary:
      (1)   A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the
workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five
percent (25%) to fifty percent (50%) higher risk of heart attack and higher
rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased
acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function.(9)
      (2)   The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General’s Report, The Health Consequences of
Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, has concluded that establishing smoke-
free workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke
exposure does not occur in the workplace, because ventilation and other air
cleaning technologies cannot completely control for exposure of nonsmokers to
secondhand smoke.(10)
      (3)   The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning
Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke-free
environments. ASHRAE has determined that there is currently no air filtration
or other ventilation technology that can completely eliminate all the
carcinogenic components in secondhand smoke and the health risks caused by
secondhand smoke exposure and recommends that indoor environments be smoke-free
in their entirety. In 2015, ASHRAE amended its ventilation Standard for
Acceptable Indoor Air Quality (62.1) to include an environment that is
completely free from marijuana smoke and emissions from electronic smoking
devices.(11)
      (4)   During periods of active smoking either outdoors or indoors, peak
and average outdoor tobacco smoke levels measured in outdoor cafes and
restaurant and bar patios near smokers rival indoor smoke concentrations.(12)
      (5)   Secondhand smoke exposure may increase the risk of smoking,
especially among never-smoking college students.(13)
   (E)   Accordingly, the Dayton City Council finds and declares that the
purposes of this chapter are (1) to protect the public health and welfare by
prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and (2) to
guarantee the right of all residents and visitors to breathe smoke-free air,
and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority
over the desire to smoke.

      (1)   “DWELLING UNIT.” Any group of rooms located within a building or
structure, including mobile homes, and forming a single housekeeping unit with
facilities which are used or designed to be used for living, sleeping, cooking
or eating.
      (2)   “DWELLING.” Any building which contains one or more dwelling units
or any rooming unit, rooms or area designated or used for sleeping purposes
either as a primary use or use on casual occasions. “DWELLING” shall also
include a rooming house, motels, tourist homes, school dormitories, and
apartment buildings.
      (3)   “OWNER.” Any corporation, company, partnership or other association
or any natural person, who, alone, jointly, or with several others shall:
         (a)   Have all or part of the legal title to any dwelling or dwelling
unit, with or without accompanying actual possession thereof, or shall have all
or part of the beneficial ownership of any dwelling unit and a right to present
use and enjoyment thereof, including a mortgage in possession; or
         (b)   Have charge, care, or control of any dwelling or dwelling unit
as owner, executor, administrator, trustee, guardian of the estate, or duly
authorized agent of the owner. Any such person thus representing the actual
owner shall be bound to comply with the owner’s obligations under this section.
      (4)   “ROOMING UNIT.” Any room which is designed or used for sleeping
purposes. A “ROOMING UNIT” may also include a room in a rooming house, a hotel,
a motel, a tourist home, a school dormity, or an apartment building which may,
or may not have some additional facilities for eating or cooking contained

   (B)   (1)   Subject to such exceptions and conditions for compliance as
stated herein, six months after the effective date of this section, smoke
detectors shall be required in all dwellings privately owned or rented for
occupancy. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new and/or
existing occupied dwelling unit to install smoke detectors in each dwelling
unit as hereinafter provided. Said smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing
visible or invisible particles or combustion and providing a suitable audible
(or visual for a deaf or hearing impaired person) alarm.
      (2)   This section shall apply to any and all dwellings or dwelling
units, new or existing, which are not otherwise required to have smoke
detectors located herein under the provisions of the currently adopted Kentucky
Building Code and/or the currently adopted Life Safety Code (LSC 101).
   (C)   (1)   In order to comply with this section, only ionization or
photoelectric-type detectors approved by a nationally recognized testing
laboratory shall be installed. As an alternative to self- contained smoke
detectors, under certain limited conditions, an approved fire-detection system
or a combination thereof may be installed. Each and every alternative system
must be individually approved in written form by the Fire Chief or the Chief
Fire Inspector of the City Fire Department.
      (2)   Smoke detectors in new residential dwellings shall be wired
directly (hard wired) to the building. In existing buildings, it is preferred
that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power supply; however, said
detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery or operated by an electrical
plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device, provided that the
outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the main power supply.
      (3)   Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with applicable
National Fire Protection Act (N.F.P.A.) Standards. Detectors may be ceiling- or

kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section. In a
dwelling unit which contains a well defined sleeping room separated from the
other activity areas of the same unit, the detectors shall be located in the
corridor within the unit or interior area giving access to the rooms used for
sleeping purposes. Where sleeping areas are separated and/or where a single
smoke detector will not adequately service all sleeping areas, there shall be a
smoke detector installed adjacent to each sleeping area.
      (5)   In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally located on the
ceiling.
      (6)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any rooming
unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each
dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally located
common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately service all sleeping
areas.
      (7)   At least one detector shall be installed in or near each stairway
leading up to an occupied area in such a manner as to assure that rising smoke
is not obstructed in reaching the detector and the detector intercepts rising
smoke before it reaches the occupied area.
   (D)   (1)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for supplying and
installing in an operable condition the required detector(s) and for providing
maintenance and testing in an owner- occupied residence; or for providing the
manufacturer’s maintenance and testing instructions to a tenant in the case of
rental property.
      (2)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for maintenance and
testing of detectors, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, which
are located in common areas and/or detectors in rooming units where the tenant
usually has short periods of occupancy (hotels, motels, rooming or tourist
homes).
      (3)   The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and testing the
detector, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, which are within
his or her exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant shall
be responsible for notifying the owner when a detector becomes inoperable,
whereafter the owner has ten days in which to repair or replace in operable
condition said detector(s). In the battery-operated detectors, battery
replacement shall be the responsibility of the tenant.
      (4)   At every change of tenancy, it shall be the duty of the owner to
test and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition.
      (5)   At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by
or incidental to a sale, lease or sublease of said unit, it shall be the duty
of the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor, or sublessor, as the case may
be) to provide, before occupancy by the new occupant thereof, that all smoke
detectors which are required by this section (and other applicable laws) are
installed and in proper working condition. Failure to comply with this division
shall be punishable as set forth herein, provided, however, that this division
shall not be construed to violate or render void any contract, lease or
sublease subject hereto.
      (6)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly connected
(permanently wired) to the electrical system of a structure without the proper
electrical certification.
   (E)   This section is intended to be used with, and supplemented by, the
applicable provisions of the National Fire Protection Standards 72-E and 74
(current edition) which are hereby incorporated herein; however, if there shall
be any conflict between this section and the said supplemental standards, this
section and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall pervail.
All amendments to or changes in N.F.P.A. Nos. 72-E and 74 are adopted and made
a part hereof without further reference.
   (F)   (1)   The Fire Chief or the Fire Inspector of the City Fire Department
shall be primarily responsible for the enforcement of this section.
      (2)   The City Inspector shall assist the Fire Chief by making referrals
to the Fire Chief as part of its regular inspection and enforcement of all city
housing, building and safety codes. No building permits for remodeling or
repair of a dwelling unit shall be issued for any dwelling unit not properly
equipped with said detectors. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for
any new dwelling or dwelling unit not properly equipped with said detectors.
Detectors must be operable for the final inspection of the City Inspector and
the Fire Chief. Instructions/maintenance booklets must be provided to the owner
by the manufacturer as per N.F.P.A. No. 74, and said documentation displayed to
the City Inspector or Fire Chief during the final inspection.

owner first submits an application and pays an annual rental inspection license
fee for each rental dwelling unit it owns or operates in the city.

individual or entity not residing in the Commonwealth of Kentucky unless such

requested by the inspector or other city official, a copy of the rental
inspection license for these dwelling unit(s). The rental inspection license is

inspection license shall give notice, in writing, to the inspector within
twenty-four (24) hours after transferring the property or otherwise disposing
of ownership or legal control of it. Such notice shall include the name and
address of the person or entity that now owns or controls the rental dwelling.

finds conditions or practices that violate provisions of this subchapter, he or
she may serve upon the owner or its designee notice of such violation as
provided herein. This notice shall be served by the city by either hand
delivery to the owner or its agent or by first-class, U.S. mail at its last
known address. Such notice shall state that if the cited violations are not
corrected within a reasonable time, the owner may be subject to civil fines
and/or a suspension or revocation of owner’s occupational license and/or rental
inspection license.
   (J)   At the end of the time allowed for correction of any violations cited
by the inspector, the inspector shall reinspect the rental dwelling unit, at a
cost of forty dollars ($40) per each additional inspection. If the inspector
determines that the violations still exist or have not been properly corrected,
then he or she may issue an order assessing fines for noncompliance and/or take
action to suspend the city’s rental inspection license and occupational
licenses for the rental dwelling. The inspector shall notify the owner of this
action in writing and the owner may request a hearing, in writing, before the
Code Enforcement Board within seven (7) days after receipt of the notice of
violation.
   (K)   Any person whose license to operate a rental dwelling has been
suspended and who has been notified as provided herein shall be entitled to a
hearing in the manner provided for in § 150.88 of this subchapter. The city
will not revoke a rental inspection license while a hearing is pending. If,
upon reinspection, the inspector finds that the rental dwelling cited with a
notice of violation is now in compliance with this subchapter, then the
inspector shall reinstate the license by written order, which will
automatically cancel any pending hearing.

Board within the fourteen-day period, the owner shall be deemed to have waived
the right to pre-compliance review of the inspection;

compliance review of an inspection, the Code Enforcement Department shall
provide the Board with a written explanation of its purpose, scope, propriety,

Code Enforcement Department and mail it to the owner by regular U.S. Mail to
the owner's address of record;
         (f)   The owner and the Code Enforcement Department shall
comply with the written determination of the Board; and
         (g)   In the event a review request is not timely submitted, or in the
event the Board allows an inspection to proceed and the owner does not permit
the inspection to proceed, the Code Enforcement Department may issue a citation
for noncompliance and the Department, at its discretion, mar seek to obtain an
administrative warrant for entry to the property for purposes of inspection.

threat to the public interest, safety, welfare, or otherwise involves exigent
circumstances.

complaint about his or her rental dwelling unit with the city.

cause any loud, unnecessary, or unusual noise or any noise which either annoys,
disturbs, injures, or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace, or safety,
of others within the city limits;
      (2)   If the owner continually and persistently allows a public nuisance
on the premises or permits persons occupying a rental dwelling to cause
inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm or wantonly create a risk by engaging in
fighting or in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior, or to cause a
hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act that serves no
legitimate purpose;
      (3)   If the owner continually and persistently allows a public nuisance
on the premises or permits persons occupying any rental dwelling to emit or
cause any foul, offensive, nauseous, noxious, or disagreeable odors that are
extremely repulsive to the physical senses of reasonable persons, which annoy,
cause discomfort, injury, or inconvenience to others within the city;
      (4)   If the owner fails to make corrections or repairs mandated by the
inspector, which include, but are not limited to, work required to ensure the
rental dwelling is safe and sanitary; or
      (5)   If the owner has failed to pay any city taxes, fees, or
obligations.
   (C)   Final decisions of the Dayton Code Enforcement Board may be appealed
to Campbell District Court.
   (D)   If an owner files an action for a writ of forcible detainer in the
Campbell County District Court or for any action of ejectment in a court of
competent jurisdiction for eviction of a tenant who is the cause of a nuisance,
as described herein, then any proceeding before the Board shall be placed on
hold pending a final determination by the court. If the court refuses to evict
the offending tenant and the owner has made a good faith effort to abate the
nuisance by eviction, then any pending proceeding before the Code Enforcement
Board shall be dismissed. Dismissal shall not prevent the city, through the
inspector, from implementing the provisions of this subchapter to abate future
or continuing nuisances occurring in the rental dwelling.
   (E)   The inspector shall cooperate with an owner who is attempting to evict
a tenant charged with creating a nuisance by furnishing documentary and/or oral
evidence, if applicable, to the court to support the owner’s efforts to prove
the existence of a nuisance.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has, in KRS Chapter 100,
delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed
to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council hereby adopts the following floodplain management
regulations as set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 1, § A, passed 9-5-06)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains, causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the
location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 1, § B, passed 9-5-06)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 1, § C, passed 9-5-06)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood- prone areas in
such a manner as to minimize future flood-blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 1, § D, passed 9-5-06)
§ 152.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   “A ZONE.” Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A Zones, flood waters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).” A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   “ACCESSORY USE.” A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   “ADDITION TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE.” Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   “A99 ZONE.” That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system
under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   “AE ZONE.” Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual chance
flood (100-year) flood. Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   “AH ZONE.” An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   “AO ZONE.” An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   “APPEAL.” A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   “AR/Al – A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AND AR/A ZONES.” Special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) that result from the decertification of a previously accredited
flood protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a
100-year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete
these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding
sources.
   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.” A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to
three feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “BASE FLOOD.” A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the “100-year flood”). Base flood is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).” The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, Al-30, AR, AR/IA, AR/AE, AR/Al-A30, AR/AH,
and AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood
that has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   “BASEMENT.” Any area of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   “BUILDING.” See definition for “structure.”
   “COMMUNITY.” A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   “COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA).” An area that has been determined by
the Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by flood waters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).” A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the
regular program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures for protection from flooding.
   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. Critical facilities include, but are not
limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to
avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and
equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water- reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   “D ZONE.” An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   “DEVELOPMENT.” Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,

in the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   “ENCLOSURE.” That portion of a structure below the lowest floor used solely
for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the structure.

fill, excavation, structures, or development into a floodplain, which may
impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   “EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.” Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMs effective before that date. Existing construction may also be referred to
as existing structures.
   “EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by a community.
   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads.

or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to
low risk of flooding.
   “FLOOD” or “FLOODING.” A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete innudation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      (3)   Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to
a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surface of normally dry land areas, as
when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
      (4)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding.
   “FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).” A map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and
the regulatory floodway.
   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).” A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
   “FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).” A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated special flood hazard areas and risk
premium zones.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY.” The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) containing flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM), and/or the Flood Boundary Floodway Map (FBFM), and the water
surface elevation of the base flood.
   “FLOODPLAIN” or “FLOOD-PRONE AREA.” Any land area susceptible to being
inundated by flood waters from any source.
   “FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.” The individual appointed by a community to
administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.” The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   “FLOODPROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification, stating that a nonresidential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of
water, and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the “regulatory floodway.”
   “FLOODWAY FRINGE.” That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway.
   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in § 152.52, Appeals and variance
procedures, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the Board of
Adjustments will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds
to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to
100 years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.” A facility, structure, or other
development which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “GOVERNING BODY.” The local governing unit, i.e. the city that is empowered
to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry.
   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.” The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood-routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, or
directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).” Increased cost of compliance coverage
means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a
substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and
that is required to being a substantially damaged building into compliance with
the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
floodproofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any
combination thereof. ICC coverage is available on residential and non-
residential buildings (this category includes public or government buildings,
such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   “LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs include the following
categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was inadvertently included in a designated SFHA. An
LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property
is not located in an SFHA.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   Letter of Map Revision – Based on Fill (LOMR F). A determination
that a structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill
above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA.
   “LEVEE.” A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary

where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in an FIS.
   “REGULATORY FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
See “base flood.”
   “REMEDY A VIOLATION.” The process by which a community brings a structure or
other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management
regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impact of
noncompliance. Reduced impact may include protecting the structure or other
affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement
provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or
reducing state or federal financing exposure with regard to the structure or
other development.
   “REPAIR.” The reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing
structure.
   “REPETITIVE LOSS.” Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two or

damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the

anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
   (B)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding; and if within Zones AH or AO, so that there are
adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters
around and away from proposed structures;
   (F)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
   (G)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;
   (H)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
   (I)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall
meet the requirements of new construction as contained in this chapter; and
   (J)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not furthered, extended, or
replaced.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § A, passed 9-5-06)
§ 152.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided as set forth in § 152.07, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and ductwork elevated no
lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation
perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to
facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall be
provided in accordance with standards of division (C) of this section.
      (1)   In an AO Zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in
feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent
grade if no depth number is specified. (The Commonwealth of Kentucky recommends
that the lowest floor be elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height
higher than the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM by at least one
foot, or elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade if no
depth number is specified.)
      (2)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than one foot
above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR Chapter 4, Regulation 060,
Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for a state
floodplain permit: The applicant shall provide cross-sections for determining
floodway boundaries, and thereby base flood elevations, at any proposed
construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross-sections shall
be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no
more than ± 0.5 foot. Cross-section elevations shall be taken at those points
which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross-section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the Cabinet may require additional cross- sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation.
      (4)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure,
including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes, shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation two feet above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification along with the
design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided Floodplain
Administrator.
      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) of this
section.
      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood- resistant materials below
an elevation two feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood water. Opening sizes for meeting this
requirement must meet or exceed the standards of § 152.31(C).
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest level
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect and meet the following
minimum criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade, which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters
in both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
      (4)   The total floor area of all such enclosed areas shall not exceed
300 square feet.
      (5)   For enclosures greater that seven feet in interior height, where
elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest adjacent grade, a copy
of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the conversion of the area
below the lowest floor to a use or dimension contrary to the structures’
originally approved design, shall be presented as a condition of issue of the
final certificate of occupancy.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
         (a)   On individual lots or parcels;
         (b)   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (c)   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
         (d)   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (e)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
         (f)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of
a flood.
      (2)   All manufactured homes must:
         (a)   Be elevated on a permanent foundation; and
         (b)   Have the lowest floor elevated no lower than two feet above the
level of the base flood elevation, (the Commonwealth of Kentucky recommends at
least one foot above the base flood elevation); and
         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (3)   Excepting manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage
as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
so that either:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
         (b)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, Al-
30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes.
         (c)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 152.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If division (E)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§ 152.30 through 152.36.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § B, passed 9-5-06; Am. Ord. 2006-19, passed 9-19-06;

§ 152.32 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 152.07, where
streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base
flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with § 152.07.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § C, passed 9-5-06; Am. Ord. 2014-1, passed 2-4-14)
§ 152.33 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 152.07, are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards
associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined
channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation, or in Zone AO, the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as stated in § 152.31(B).
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § D, passed 9-5-06)
§ 152.34 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the
elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards;
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available, base flood elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals and
other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided;
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood
elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator; and
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § E, passed 9-5-06; Am. Ord. 2014-1, passed 2-4-14)
§ 152.35 STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE
LETTER “A”.
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated “A”
the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Must be non-habitable;
   (B)   Must be anchored to resist flotation and lateral movement;
   (C)   Must be provided with flood openings in accordance with the standards
of § 152.31(C);
   (D)   Must be built of flood resistant materials below a level two feet
above the base flood elevation;
   (E)   Must elevate utilities one foot above the base flood elevation;
   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking;
   (G)   Must not be modified for a different use after permitting.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § F, passed 9-5-06; Am. Ord. 2014-1, passed 2-4-14)
§ 152.36 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation at the
site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into flood waters. Access
routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be
provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;
         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner;
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, “adversely
affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with § 152.07, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or
other source, in order to administer §§ 152.30 through 152.36. Any such
information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption.
      (3)   Notification of other agencies.

any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse;
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and
         (c)   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      (4)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
         (a)   Certification required by § 152.51(B)(1) (lowest floor
elevations) as shown on an accurately completed and certified elevation
certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially
improved structures, in accordance with § 152.51(B)(2);
         (b)   Certification required by § 152.51(B)(2) (elevation or
floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown on an accurately completed
and certified floodproofing certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation
(in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved
structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with § 152.51(B)(2);
         (c)   Certification required by § 152.31(C);
         (d)   Certification of elevation required by § 152.34(A) (subdivision
standards);
         (e)   Certification required by § 152.31(E) (floodway encroachments);
         (f)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood- carrying capacity is
not diminished;

         (h)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this
chapter as specified in §§ 152.98 and 152.99.
      (5)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions,
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in § 152.52(C)(1);
         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with § 152.07, then the Floodplain Administrator shall
obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway
data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer
the provisions of §§ 152.30 through 152.36;
         (c)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with § 152.31(B) a
floodproofing certificate;
         (d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall
be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be open
for public inspection.
      (6)   Right of entry.
         (a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the Administrator has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any
condition or ordinance violation which makes such building, structure or
premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Floodplain Administrator may enter
such building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the
same or perform any duty imposed upon the Administrator by this chapter.
         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, the Floodplain
Administrator he or she shall first present proper credentials and request
entry. If such building, structure, or premises are unoccupied, the Floodplain
Administrator shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other
persons having charge or control of such request entry.
         (c)   If entry is refused, the Floodplain Administrator shall have
recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
         (d)   When the Floodplain Administrator shall have first obtained a
proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no
owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any
building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is
made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the Floodplain
Administrator for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this
chapter.
      (7)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator,
work on any building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the
provisions of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in
writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her
agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under
which work may be resumed.
      (8)   Revocation of permits.
         (a)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based.
         (b)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination by the Administrator that the construction, erection, alteration,
repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for
which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the
provisions of this chapter.
      (9)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the Floodplain
Administrator’s staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties, shall
not thereby render the Floodplain Administrator personally liable, and is
hereby relieved from all personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to
persons or property as a result of any act required or permitted in the
discharge of the Floodplain Administrator’s duties. Any suit brought against
any officer, employee, or member because of such act performed by him or her in
the enforcement of any provision of this chapter shall be defended by the
department of law until the final termination of the proceedings.
      (10)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A floodplain
development permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
“start of construction” permit has not occurred within 180 calendar days from
the date of its issuance.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 4, §§ A, C, passed 9-5-06; Am. Ord. 2014-1, passed 2-4-14)
§ 152.51 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
152.07. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of the Administrator
is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be processed.
Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure will be floodproofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet
the floodproofing criteria in § 152.31 (B) and § 152.33(B);
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, Al-30, AH, and A
Zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and
floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop- work order for the project.
(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 4, § B, passed 9-5-06)
§ 152.52 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of variance and appeal board. City Council shall establish
an Appeal Board consisting of the Board of Adjustments.
   (C)   Duties of variance and Appeal Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Campbell Circuit Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
   (E)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. Minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, as defined in § 152.05,
“public safety and nuisance”, cause fraud or victimization of the public, as
defined in § 152.05, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of divisions (D)(1)
through (D)(5) above are satisfied and that the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a
public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage, and;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Campbell County Clerk and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and
report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition in § 152.05) upon
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.

§ 152.98 CIVIL OFFENSE; NOTICE OF CITATION AND VIOLATION.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and
any approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation
is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set forth in the
citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or requesting a
hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the citation is issued
does not respond to the citation within seven days, that person shall be deemed
to have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a violation
occurred shall be considered final.

§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
guilty of a misdemeanor offense. Any person who violates this chapter or fails
to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined
no less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than one
year, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in
the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.

   A.   Nonconforming lots of record:
      1.   Any lot of record which does not meet the requirements of this
appendix shall be considered a nonconforming lot of record.
      2.   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots
with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of
passage or amendment of this appendix, and if all or part of the lots do not
meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this appendix,
the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this appendix, and no portion of that parcel shall be used or sold
which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this
appendix, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining
any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this appendix.
      3.   Where a single nonconforming lot of record exists having a lot area
less than required by the particular zone district wherein the lot is located,
development may be permitted on the lot, provided: the lot is located on an
existing and improved public street; the lot is of separate ownership from all
adjacent and contiguous parcels; the adjacent and contiguous parcels exist as
developed building lots or dedicated street right-of-ways precluding
acquisition of additional area to achieve conformity; and development proposed
on the lot is in conformance with all other requirements of this appendix.

necessary to develop on the lot, an application for dimensional variance shall
be submitted for review and approval by the Board of Adjustment in accordance
with §
18.0 through
18.11.
   B.   Nonconforming uses:
      1.   Continuance: Except as herein provided, the lawful use of any
structure or land existing at the time of the adoption of this appendix may be
continued although that use does not conform to the provisions of this
appendix; it shall become a legal nonconforming use. However, no nonconforming
use or structure may be enlarged or extended beyond its area of use at the time
it becomes a legal nonconforming use, unless and until the use is brought into
conformance with all provisions of this appendix.
      2.   Change from one nonconforming use to another:
         a.   The lawful use of a building or premises existing at the time of
adoption of this zoning code may be continued, although such use does not
conform to the provisions of such zoning code, except as otherwise provided
therein.
         b.   The Board of Adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or
extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at
the time the regulation which makes its use nonconforming was adopted, nor
shall the Board permit as change from one nonconforming use to another unless
the new nonconforming use is in the same or a more restrictive classification.
However, the Board may grant approval, effective to maintain nonconforming-use
status, for enlargements or extensions, made or to be    made, of the
facilities of a nonconforming use, where the use consists of the presenting of
a major public attraction or attractions, such as a sports event or events,
which has been presented at the same site over such period of years and has
such attributes and public acceptance as to have attained international
prestige and to have achieved the status of a public tradition, contributing
substantially to the economy of the community and state, of which prestige and
status the site is an essential element, and where the enlargement or extension
was or is designed to maintain the prestige and status by meeting the
increasing demands of participants and patrons.
      3.   Termination: in all cases, the Board of Adjustments shall hold a
public hearing in accordance with the applicable requirements of §
18.2. Following that hearing, the Board may terminate the right to operate a

is to do so, the Board shall state its bases, in writing, for that
determination.
         a.   Non-operative, non-used, or abandoned for a period of 12
consecutive months providing that the Board of Adjustments may allow the
continuation of that nonconforming use if it is determined that reasons for the
nonuse were beyond the owner’s/ operator’s control.
         b.   Whenever the structure, in which the nonconforming use is
operated, is damaged in any manner whatsoever and the cost of repairing such
damage exceeds 50% of the market value of that structure in which the
nonconforming use is operated and a determination is made by the Board of
Adjustment that this structure should not be reconstructed.
         c.   Whenever the structure, in which the nonconforming use is
operated, becomes obsolete or substandard under any applicable ordinance of the
city and the cost of placing that structure in lawful compliance with the
applicable ordinance exceeds 50% of the market value of that structure as of
the date of the official order under the applicable ordinance and a
determination is made by the Board of Adjustment that this structure should not
be reconstructed.
         d.   Whenever said nonconforming use is determined to be detrimental
or injurious to the public health, safety, or general welfare.

structure existing at the time of adoption of this appendix, may be occupied,
operated, and maintained in a state of good repair, but no nonconforming
structure shall be enlarged or extended unless the enlargement or extension can
be, and is, made in compliance with all of the provisions of this appendix.
      2.   Termination: In all cases the Board of Adjustment shall hold a
public hearing in accordance with the applicable requirements of §
18.2. Following that hearing, the Board may terminate the right to operate a
nonconforming structure based on any of the following conditions, and if the
decision is to do so, the Board shall state its bases, in writing, for that
determination.

exceeds 50% of the market value of that structure and a determination is made
by the Board of Adjustment that the structure should not be reconstructed.
         b.   Whenever the nonconforming structure becomes obsolete or
substandard under any applicable ordinance of the city and the cost of placing
the nonconforming structure in lawful compliance with the applicable ordinance
exceeds 50% of the market value of the nonconforming structure as of the date
of the official order under the applicable ordinance and a determination is
made by the Board of Adjustment that the structure should not be reconstructed.
         c.   Whenever a nonconforming structure is determined to be
detrimental or injurious to the public health, safety, or general welfare.
      3.   Zone change: The foregoing provisions shall apply to structures
which become legally nonconforming due to zone changes which take place
thereafter.
   D.   Repairs and maintenance:
      1.   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming
use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement or

public hearing in accordance with the applicable requirements of §
18.2. Following that hearing, the Board may terminate the right to operate a
nonconforming sign based on any of the following conditions and, if the
decision is to do so, the Board shall state its bases, in writing, for
determination and the property owner shall be responsible to remove the sign at
the owner’s expense. If the sign is not removed within 30 days of the date of
the Board’s action to terminate the sign, the city may remove the sign and may
bill the owner, or attach the cost of the service to the annual property tax
bill:
         a.   Not meeting the requirements for sign regulations, as regulated
in §
14.0 through

      2.   That such use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, or
general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to
property or improvements in the vicinity.
   B.   Conditional use permits: in accordance with KRS 100.237, the Board of
Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide applications for conditional
use permits to allow the proper integration into the community of uses which
are specifically named herein which may be suitable only in specific locations
in the zone only if certain conditions are met:
      1.   The Board of Adjustments may approve, modify, or deny any
application for a conditional use permit. If it approves a permit, it may
attach necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or
more things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a
continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board’s minutes
and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference to the specific
section in the zoning regulation listing the conditional use under
consideration. In addition, said conditional use permit shall be recorded in
the office of the County clerk and one copy of said permit attached to the deed
for the property for which it is issued. The Board shall have power to revoke
conditional use permits, or variance for noncompliance with the condition
thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have a right of action to compel
offending structures or uses removed at the cost of the violator and may have
judgment in persona for that cost.
      2.   Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant
from complying with all of the requirements of this appendix, the building
code, housing code, and other regulations of the city.
      3.   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within the time limit set by the Board or within 12 consecutive calendar months
from date of issuance, such conditional use permit shall not revert to its
original designation unless there has been a public hearing. Exercised as set
forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for the construction
of the main building or other improvement has been let; or in the absence of
contracts that the main building or other improvement is under construction to
a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial
investment shall be under contract, in development, or completed. When
construction is not a part of the use, exercised shall mean that the use is in
operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.
      4.   a.   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall review all
conditional use permits, except those for which all conditions have been
permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to
inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located in order to
ascertain that the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are
listed on the conditional use permits.
         b.   If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions
listed on the conditional use permit, the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator
shall report the fact in writing to the Chairman of the Board of Adjustment.
The report shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not
complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit, and a copy of the
report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time it is furnished to
the chairman of the Board of Adjustment.
         c.   The Board shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable
time, and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the
landowner at least one week prior to the hearing. If the Board of Adjustment
finds that the facts alleged in the report of the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator are true and that the landowner has taken no steps to comply
within the time between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, the
Board of Adjustment may authorize the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator to
revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause
the termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit
authorizes.
      5.   Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional use permit
and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely
and permanently satisfied, the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, upon
request of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that
the conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts which indicate that the
conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of
the conditional use permit which is on file with the County clerk, as required
in KRS 100.329. Thereafter the use, if it continues to meet the other
requirements of this appendix, will be treated as a permitted use.

SECTION 9.25 GENERAL MOBILE HOME REGULATIONS.
   The following shall apply to all mobile homes located in a mobile home park.
Requirements of the zone in which the mobile homes are permitted shall also
apply:
   A.   The mobile home shall, at a minimum, be equipped with plumbing and
electrical connections designed for attachment to appropriate external systems.
   B.   All health, sanitation (including sewers and/or private secondary
sewage treatment plants approved by the Northern Kentucky District Health
Department and the Sanitation District No. 1 of Campbell and Kenton Counties),
and safety requirements applicable to a conventional dwelling, shall be equally
applicable to a mobile home.
   C.   The mobile home shall be set and adequately anchored on a concrete or
hard surfaced slab in accordance with the Kentucky Mobile Home and Recreational
Vehicle Park regulations and the open space between the ground and the floor f
the mobile home shall be enclosed with some material as concrete block,
corrugated metal, or other durable and suitable material.
   D.   Any person, firm, or corporation desiring to locate a mobile home shall
apply for a zoning/building permit, and an occupancy permit. Applicable permits
must be approved prior to the installation and occupancy of any mobile home.
The proper permits must be displayed in a conspicuous location in each mobile
home, signifying that all permits have been approved by the City Inspector/
Zoning Administrator.
   E.   All mobile homes shall meet the requirements of KRS 219.310 through
219.410.
SECTION 9.26 PHASED ZONING REGULATIONS.
   A.   Phased zoning is an overlay type regulation to be used in cases where
the timing and/or phasing of the zoning of an area is especially critical to
the implementation of the adopted Comprehensive Plan. The intent of the phased
zoning regulations is to encourage redevelopment of a specified area for the
use or density designated on the Comprehensive Plan when the necessary
conditions for such development are realized (e.g., demolition of existing
deteriorated areas; provision of urban services, such as public water and
centralized sanitary sewer systems). Implicit in such a phased zoning approach
is the premise that until such conditions are realized, the type of development
identified by the comprehensive plan is premature; such development would be
prevented by temporarily zoning the area to generally conform with the
predominant existing land use, with a clear stipulation of an intended future
re-zoning, which would be in compliance with the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
   B.   The phased zoning regulations may be overlaid over any zoning
classification by means of a conventional zone change process. The use of the
phased zoning regulations would indicate that the regulations of the overlaid
zone are currently being enforced based upon the general existing land use, but
on attainment of all the requirements of the zone which corresponds to the
adopted Comprehensive Plan for type of use or density, the area could be
rezoned in direct compliance with the plan.
   C.   Phased zones are indicated on the official zoning map by adding to the
overlaid zone, the letter “P” as a suffix enclosed in parentheses. For example,
in order to properly phase its change, an area zoned R-1JJ, which is identified
for future use on the adopted Comprehensive Plan for industrial could be
temporarily zoned R-1JJ (P), indicated that present development on the site
would be in conformance with the regulations of the overlaid R-1JJ Zone, but
that, upon the attainment of certain conditions (for example, provision of
flood levee and demolition of existing buildings) as indicated on the local
Comprehensive Plan, the area could be rezoned through a conventional zone
change procedure. At the time of the zone change, the temporary R-1JJ (P) zone
is removed and the area is developed according to the regulations of the new
zone, which is in conformance with the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
   D.   The minimum size of any area to be rezoned as regulated by this section
of the ordinance is five acres, provided that all other provisions of this
appendix and the subdivision regulations are adhered to. Development of a
smaller tract adjacent to an existing zone being requested may be permitted if
the proposed development conforms to and extends the original development as if
the new area had been a part of the original development and provided further
that the zone is in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.

City Council take action to impose different conditions than were reviewed and
considered by the Planning
Commission then said conditions shall be resubmitted to the Planning Commission
for further review and recommendations in accordance with division C.1.a.
above. Approval of the RCD Overlay Zone shall require that development be in
conformance with the Stage I approved plan.
         c.   The City Council shall forward a copy of the approved plan to the
Planning Commission for further processing in accordance with the requirement
for Stage II Plan and record plat.
         d.   Zoning map amendment - upon approval of the RCD Overlay Zone, the

of the proposed RCD shall be retained as common open space and recreation area,
and dedicated to a public or private entity for operation and maintenance. The
open space and recreation areas shall be physically situated so as to be
readily accessible, available to, and usable by all residents of the RCD.
Common open space and recreation area shall be that part of the total project
exclusive of dwellings, streets, parking areas, single-family lots, commercial
areas, and other non-open space and non-recreationally oriented facilities.
   K.   Amendments: any amendments to plans, except for the minor adjustments
which may be permitted by the Planning Commission, shall be made in accordance
with the procedure required by this appendix, subject to the same limitations
and requirements as those under which such plans were originally approved.
   L.   Expiration: any amendment to RCD Overlay Zone shall be subject to the
time constraints, as noted below. Upon expiration of the time period and any
extensions thereto, the City Council may initiate a request for a public
hearing by the Planning Commission, in accordance with the requirements of KRS
Chapter 100, for the purpose of determining whether said RCD Overlay Zone
should revert to its original zoning designation. A public hearing may be
initiated if either of the following conditions apply:
      1.   A Stage II Plan has not been approved by the Planning Commission
within a period of 24 consecutive months from the date of the Stage I approved
plan and RCD Overlay Zone amendment by the City Council; provided that an
extension may be permitted upon approval of the legislative body or their duly
authorized representative if sufficient proof can be demonstrated that
prevailing conditions have not changed appreciably to render the Stage I
approved plan obsolete.

SECTION 10.15 CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD) ZONE.
   A.   Purpose: the purposes of the Central Business District (CBD) Zone are
to:
      1.   Provide for planned business district of special interest to the
proper development of the city;
      2.   Promote the revitalization of the existing business district of the
city;
      3.   Promote flexibility in the design and development of the business
district, in a planned and coordinated fashion; and
      4.   Provide for the neighborhood commercial-type needs of the city and
the surrounding area.
   B.   Criteria for evaluation of development in the CBD: in order to
encourage and guide the development of the city’s business district in a way
that will result in a coordinated approach to the entire area and ensure its
proper integration into the surrounding community, the following criteria shall
be used as the basis to evaluate any new development, including expansions or
changes to existing development, in the area zoned CBD (refer to Figure 1 of
this section, which illustrates some of these criteria):
      1.   High intensity retail/service (for example, high activity or traffic
generators) uses shall be encouraged to locate adjacent to Sixth Avenue;
      2.   Pedestrian access shall be encouraged/promoted along Sixth Avenue
via the provision of continuous sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian resting
areas or shelter areas;
      3.   Vehicular access shall be encouraged along the periphery of the CBD
Zone boundaries (such as 5th, 7th, McKinney and Berry Streets, and the alleys);
      4.   Curb cuts directly onto Sixth Avenue will be severely restricted in
order to promote the pedestrian (mall-type) orientation of Sixth Avenue (State
Route 8) as the major arterial street through the city. Access is to be
encouraged from existing streets intersecting with Sixth Avenue, the alleys, or
fifth or Seventh Avenues;
      5.   The existing alleys should be utilized for the provision of off-
street parking or loading areas via the resurfacing and widening of the alleys;
      6.   Pedestrian links should be provided from parking along the alleys or
from off-street parking facilities to the primary activity areas;
      7.   Those areas within the CBD Zone which are adjacent to existing
residential development, specifically the areas abutting 5th and 7th Streets
are transitional areas between the high intensity commercial development along
Sixth Avenue and the residential development. Every effort should be made to
utilize these areas for off-street parking facilities to provide a transition
(or buffer area) as well as encourage access on the periphery of the business
district. Any other type of development in these areas should be designed in a
manner as to be beneficial to the business area and not be detrimental to those
areas which are zoned for residential uses;
      8.   The fagade treatment of buildings including the utilization of
sings, in the CBD Zone should be relatively uniform in design and type of
materials in order to improve the overall attractiveness of the business
district;
      9.   The orientation of commercial buildings should be towards the alley
as well as towards Sixth Avenue (front, rear, or side entrance) in order to
promote the best utilization of the alleys and the safety or ease of access for
customers;
      10.   Areas adjacent to existing residences should be landscaped to
protect the existing residential development. Lighting should be provided for
the safety of customers, but should not glare onto adjacent residences.
Wherever possible, areas within the CBD Zone should also be landscaped to
improve the attractiveness of the business district;
      11.   Private off-street parking facilities shall be located within a
reasonable walking distance of the use they are intended to serve.

SECTION 10.17 NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (NCD) ZONE.
   A.   Purpose: the purpose of the Neighborhood Commercial District (NCD) Zone
is to:
      1.   Provide for planned business district of special interest to the
proper development of the city;
      2.   Promote the revitalization of the existing business district of the
city;
      3.   Promote flexibility in the design and development of the business
district, in a planned and coordinated fashion; and
      4.   Provide for the neighborhood commercial-type needs of the city and
the surrounding area.
   B.   Criteria for evaluation of development in the NCD: in order to
encourage and guide the development of the city’s business district in a way
that will result in a coordinated approach to the entire area and ensure its
proper integration into the surrounding community, the following criteria shall
be used as the basis to evaluate any new development, including expansions or
changes to existing development, in the area zoned NCD (refer to Figure 1 of §
10.15, which illustrates some of these criteria):
      1.   High intensity retail/service (for example, high activity or traffic
generators) uses shall be encouraged to locate adjacent to Sixth Avenue;
      2.   Pedestrian access shall be encouraged/promoted along Sixth Avenue
via the provision of continuous sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian resting
areas or shelter areas;
      3.   Those areas within the NCD Zone which are adjacent to existing
residential development, specifically the areas abutting 5th and 7th Streets
are transitional areas between the high intensity commercial development along
Sixth Avenue and the residential development. Every effort should be made to
utilize these areas for off-street parking facilities to provide a transition
(or buffer area) as well as encourage access on the periphery of the business
district. Any other type of development in these areas should be designed in a
manner as to be beneficial to the business area and not be detrimental to those
areas which are zoned for residential use;
      4.   The facade treatment of buildings including the utilization of sings
in the NCD Zone should be relatively uniform in design and type of materials in
order to improve the overall attractiveness of the business district;
      5.   The orientation of commercial buildings should be towards 5th Avenue
as well as towards Sixth Avenue (front, rea, or side entrance) in order to
promote the best utilization of 5th Avenue and the safety or ease of access for
customers.
      6.   Areas adjacent to existing residences should be landscaped to
protect existing residential development. Lighting should be provided for the
safety of customers, but should not glare onto adjacent residences. Whenever
possible, areas within the NCD Zone should also be landscaped to improve the
attractiveness of the commercial district.
      7.   Private off-street parking facilities shall be located within a
reasonable walking distance of the use they are intended to serve.
   C.   Permitted uses: these are the uses which are permitted on property
zoned NCD as outlined on the official zoning map providing that they are in

   A.   Purpose: the purpose of the Mixed Land Use (MLU) Zone is to provide for
the combining of offices, hotels and motels, retail and service uses, and
residential uses within a planned development. Such development is intended to
be designed to provide for an internally oriented group of activities which are
functionally integrated relative to land uses, vehicular and pedestrian
circulation, and the arrangement of structures. In addition, the intent of the
zone is to promote flexibility in design and planned diversification in the
relationships between location of and types of uses and structures; promote the
advantages of modern large scale site planning for community development
through the efficient use of land, facilitating a more economic arrangement of
buildings, circulation systems. land uses, and utilities; preserve, to the
greatest extent possible, the existing landscape features and amenities, and to
utilize such features in a harmonious fashion; provide for more usable and
suitably located open space facilities and common facilities than would
otherwise be provided under conventional land development procedures, but
always with the intention of furthering the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   B.   General: a MLU Zone may be permitted provided that all conditions or
provisions of this section, the applicable requirements of the subdivision
regulations, and any additional requirements as may be determined necessary to
provide for the most efficient layout of the MLU Zone and its proper
integration with the surrounding development are met; and a public hearing is
held on the MLU application.
   C.   Application and processing: applications for Mixed Land Use Zone shall
be processed as follows in two stages:
      1.   Stage I: applications for a map amendment to zone an area for MLU
shall be accompanied by a development plan, in accordance with the Stage I Plan
requirements, provided for within §
9.20. If an area, however, is currently zoned MLU, the submission of the Stage
I development plan for review by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
legislative body, shall not be required until the area is proposed to be
developed.
         a.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
proposed application (development plan Stage I and where applicable, the zoning
map amendment), in accordance with the requirements of KRS Chapter 424, and
review said application with regard to its compliance with the stated purposes
of the MLU Zone, the required elements of the Stage I Plan and other applicable
requirements of this section. Upon holding such hearing, the Planning
Commission shall make one of the following recommendations to the legislative
body approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval. The Planning
Commission shall submit, along with their recommendations, a copy of the Stage
I Plan and the bases for their recommendation.
         b.   The legislative body shall, within 45 days after receiving the
recommendations of the Planning Commission, review said recommendations and
take action to approve, or disapprove said MLU application. Such action may
incorporate any conditions imposed by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
However, should the legislative body take action to impose different conditions
than were reviewed and considered the Planning Commission, then said conditions
shall be resubmitted to the Planning Commission for further review and
recommendation, in accordance with division C.1.a. Approval of the MLU Zone
shall require that development be in conformance with the Stage I approved
plan. The legislative body shall forward a copy of the approved plan to the
Planning Commission for further processing, in accordance with the requirement
for Stage II plan and record plat.
         c.   Zoning map amendment - upon approval of the MLU Zone, the
official zoning map shall be amended by designating the area as identified in
the application or as shown on the Stage I approved plan.
      2.   Stage II Plan and Record Plat: a Stage II plan and record plat shall
be developed in conformance with the Stage I approved plan and in accordance
with the requirements of §
9.20.B. and C., and submitted to the Planning Commission for its review and
approval. Except for the manner of submission and processing, the subdivision
regulations may be waived, where applicable, and the requirements of §
9.20.B. and C. shall be substituted therefore. Those requirements not
specifically waived by the Planning Commission shall conform with the
subdivision regulations.
         a.   The Planning Commission shall review the submitted Stage II plan
with regard to its compliance with the required elements of §
9.20.B., for Stage II plans, other applicable elements of this appendix and
other applicable regulations, and its conformity with the Stage I approved
plan. The Planning Commission, in approving the Stage II plan, may authorize
minor adjustments from the Stage I approved plan provided that the adjustments
do not change land uses, increase overall density, significantly alter
circulation patterns (vehicular and pedestrian) or decrease the amount and/or
usability of open space or recreation areas, or conflict with other applicable
requirements of this section, for example, parking requirements.
         b.   Upon Planning Commission approval of the Stage II plan, a copy of
said plan shall be forwarded to the city’s Zoning Administrator, who shall
grant permits only in accordance with the Stage II approved plan and other
regulations, as may be required.
         c.   Upon approval of the Stage II plan, the Planning Commission shall
review the submitted record plat, if applicable, with regard to its compliance
with the required elements of §
9.20.C. for record plats, the applicable requirements of the subdivision
regulations and its conformance with the Stage II approved plan. Upon Planning
Commission approval of the final plat, copies of said plat, certified by the
Planning Commission, and suitable for recording shall be forwarded by the
Planning Commission to the office of the county clerk to be recorded.

upon the following criteria:
      1.   Agreement with the various elements of the Comprehensive Plan and,
where applicable, any KRS Chapter 99 approved urban renewal development plan.
      2.   Extent to which the proposed development plan is consistent with the
purpose of the MLU Zone.
      3.   Adequacy of the proposed site, considering such factors as the
sufficiency of the size of the site to comply with the established criteria,
the configuration of the site, and the extent to which the site is formed by
logical boundaries (based on topography, natural features, streets,
relationship of adjacent uses, and so on).
      4.   Nature and extend of the proposed uses in relation to the unique
characteristics of the site; the current or anticipated need for such use(s)
and the specific size and locale of the market area from which the specific
uses of the site will draw or serve.
      5.   Extend to which the proposed design, as indicated in the Stage I
plan, is compatible and coordinated with the existing and/or proposed
development contiguous to the site. Compatibility and coordination with
existing and/or proposed development shall be reviewed in terms of intensity of
land use type in relation into the general character of the surrounding areas,
including coordination of vehicular and pedestrian circulation, the scale
(i.e., height and mass of structures), of the proposed development; location of
open spaces and size of setbacks; provisions of screening areas or utilization
of natural features; the transition of land use types based on the proposed
design; and the impact of the proposed development on adjacent uses, such as
noise, visual impact, hours of operation, traffic circulation, and so on.
      6.   Amount of traffic that would be generated by the proposed operation
and the ability of the existing highway system to adequately handle said
traffic. Where deficiencies exist, proposed traffic improvements that would
correct such deficiencies should be considered.
      7.   Extent to which the design of the internal street system provides
for the efficient and safe movement of traffic within and adjacent to the site.
      8.   Extend to which all necessary public utilities and facilities are
available to service the development, including police and fire protection,
water and sewer services, and other services normally provided within the area.
Where deficiencies exist, improvements that would correct such deficiencies
should be considered.
   O.   Amendments: any amendments to plans, except for the minor adjustments
which may be permitted by the Planning Commission, shall be made in accordance
with the procedure required by division C.
   P.   Expiration: development plans within the MLU Zone shall be subject to
the time constraints, as noted below. Upon expiration of said time period and
any extensions thereto, the legislative body may initiate a request for a
public hearing by the Planning Commission, in accordance with the requirements
of KRS Chapter 100, for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of the
approved development plan. A public hearing may be initiated if either of the
following conditions apply:
      1.   Stage II Plan has not been approved by the Planning Commission
within a period of 24 consecutive months from the date of the Stage I approved
plan, except as agreed upon for the phasing of development by the legislative
body; provided that an extension may be permitted upon approval of the
legislative body or their duly authorized representative, if sufficient proof
can be demonstrated that prevailing conditions have not changed appreciably to
render the Stage I approved plan obsolete.
      2.   Substantial construction has not been initiated within a period of
24 consecutive months from the date of approval of the Stage II plan by the
Planning Commission; provided that an extension may be permitted upon approval
of the legislative body or its duly authorized representative. If sufficient
proof can be demonstrated that the construction was delayed due to
circumstances beyond the applicant’s control, and that prevailing conditions
have not changed appreciably to render the Stage I approved plan obsolete. The
amount of construction constituting initiating substantial construction shall
be as approved in the Stage II approved plan.

SECTION 11.0 OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES FOR STORAGE OR PARKING OF MOTOR
VEHICLES.
   In all zones, off-street parking facilities for the storage or parking of
motor vehicles for use of occupants, employees, and patrons of the building
hereafter erected, altered or extended, and all uses of the land after the
effective date of this appendix, shall be provided and maintained as herein
prescribed. However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the date
of adoption of this appendix and provided that construction has not begun
within ninety (90) consecutive calendar days of such effective date, off-street
parking facilities in the amounts required by this appendix shall prevail.
(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)
SECTION 11.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Computation of parking spaces: in determining the number of parking
spaces required, if such spaces result in fractional parts thereof, the number
of said spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest whole number.
   B.   Additional parking spaces to be provided: whenever the intensity of use
of any building, structure, or premises shall be increase through addition of
dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units of
measurement specified herein, additional parking spaces shall be provided in
the amounts hereafter specified for that use, if the existing parking space is
inadequate to serve that increase in intensity of use.
   C.   Location of off-street parking facilities:
      1.   Off-street parking facilities shall be located as follows:
         a.   Single-Family Residential zones (R-1B, R-1C, R1D, R-lE, R-lG, R-
lH, R-1-JJ) off-street parking may be permitted in driveways in the front,
side, and rear yards of permitted uses in these zones, provided all
requirements of this appendix are met. Additionally, off-street parking may be
located in the minimum rear yard. Off-street parking areas, including
driveways, located in the front yard in a single-family residential zone may
not be greater than ten feet wide unless the ratio of unpaved area to paved
area (grass area to parking and driveway areas) in the front yard is at least
two to one. However, the Board of Adjustment may grant a variance to the two-
to-one ratio if it determines that construction of the paved area will not
adversely affect adjacent property owners.
         b.   Multi-Family residential and mobile home park zones (R-2, R-3, R-
4, RMHP): Off-street parking is permitted in minimum required side or rear
yards of permitted uses in these zones. Off-street parking may be permitted in
required front yards, only if approved by the Planning Commission according to
the required site plan.
         c.   Special Development Zones (PUD, RCD, MLU): Off-street parking
shall be located as designated on the approved site plan.
         d.   Commercial and industrial zones (CBD, IP). Except as herein
provided, off-street parking may be permitted in minimum required front, side,
and rear yards of these zones in accordance with a site plan that is approved
by the Planning Commission.
      2.   All off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same lot
or zoning lot as the building served except for the following:
         a.   Permitted uses located within multi-family and industrial zones
may supply off-street parking within 300 feet from the lot served, upon
approval of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, providing that the off
street parking facilities are unable to be provided on the same lot or
contiguous to the same lot as the building being served. In addition, the off-
street parking shall be located in the same zone as the use being served.
         b.   Existing single, two, or multi-family dwellings, which are
permitted uses herein and occupy a lot of such size that off-street parking
could not be provided on the same lot as the use being served, said off-street
parking may be permitted to locate within a distance not to exceed 300 feet
from the dwelling upon approval of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator. In
addition, the off street parking lot shall be located in the same zone as the
use being served.
         c.   Off-street parking, as required for conditional uses may be
permitted to locate on another lot than the building or use being served is
located, when approved by the Board of Adjustment, provided that the parking is
located within reasonable walking distance of the use or building being served
and available at all times without restrictions for those purposes.
         d.   Off-street parking facilities for uses permitted in the CBD Zone
may be located on another zoning lot provided that it is located within the
boundaries of the CBD Zone and approved by the Planning Commission.
   D.   Collective parking provision: collective off-street parking facilities
may be provided; however, the area for parking facilities shall not be less
than would otherwise be individually required except as provided under division
E. below.
   E.   Shared parking provision:
      1.   When any land or building is under the same ownership or upon
submission of satisfactory guarantees of the continued operation and proper
maintenance of the shared parking facility, and proposed development is for two
or more land uses excluding residential uses, the number of minimum required
parking spaces shall be computed by multiplying the minimum number of parking
spaces normally required for each land use by the appropriate percentage as
shown in the following shared parking credit table for each of the five time
periods shown. The number of parking spaces required is then determined by
adding the results in each column: the column total that generates the highest
number of parking spaces becomes the minimum parking requirement.

      2.   The following requirements shall apply to any shared parking
facility for mixed use development.
         a.   The shared parking facility must be located within 500 feet
walking distance of the entrance to the establishment to be served. Said
walkway access shall provide a safe means of pedestrian access to and from the
establishment being served.
         b.   Reserved spaces shall not be shared.
         c.   It shall be determined at the time of parking facility plan
approval that shared parking is possible and appropriate at the location
proposed. Particular attention is needed to assure that sufficient and
convenient short-term parking will be available to commercial establishments
during the weekday daytime period. The short-term shared parking spaces must be
located in the most convenient and visible area of the parking facility nearest
the establishment being served.
         d.   Any subsequent change in use shall require the issuance of a new
zoning permit and proof that minimum parking requirements, per these
regulations, will be met.
         e.   Shared parking may be utilized for other uses, which are not
shown in the parking credit table. The applicant shall prepare a similar
calculation for the proposed uses, indicating the estimated percentage of each
time period, based upon current parking information. Documentation shall be
submitted by the applicant to demonstrate that the normal and regular operating
hours of the uses proposing a shared parking arrangement do not coincide or
overlap in any manner.
   F.   Driveways not computed as part of required parking area: entrances,
exits, or driveways shall not be computed as any part of a required parking lot
or area, except in the case of single-family residential zones, where access
driveways may be used for parking.
   G.   Off-street parking space to be used for parking only: any vehicle
parking space shall be used for parking only. Any other use of such space,
including repair work or servicing of any kind other than in an emergency, or
the requirement of any payment for the use of that space, shall be deemed to
constitute a separate commercial use in violation of the provisions of this
appendix.
   H.   No building shall be erected in off-street parking space: no building
of any kind shall be erected in any off-street parking lot, except a parking
garage containing parking spaces equal to the requirements set forth in this
section or a shelter house booth for a parking attendant providing the number
of spaces required are not reduced.
   I.   Parking plan approval required: plans for all parking lot facilities,
including parking garages, shall be submitted to the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator for review and for compliance with the provisions of this
appendix and such other pertinent ordinances of the city. These plans shall
show the number of spaces and arrangements of parking aisles, location of
access points onto adjacent streets, provisions for vehicular and pedestrian
circulation, location of sidewalks and curbs on or adjacent to the property,
utilities, location of shelters for parking attendant, locations of signs,
typical cross-sections of pavement, base and subbase proposed grade of parking
lot, storm drainage facilities, location and type of lighting facilities and
such other information or plans as the circumstances may warrant. Where parking
plans include provisions for access points to adjacent streets, then those
plans shall also be prepared in accordance with the requirements of §
11.3.
(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)
SECTION 11.2 DESIGN AND LAYOUT OF OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS.
   A.   Size of off-street parking spaces: for the purposes of this appendix,
one parking space shall be a minimum of 162 square feet in area, exclusive of
access drives or aisles, and shall be a minimum of nine feet in width and
eighteen feet (18') in length. However, a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of
the number of required parking spaces may be a minimum of 128 square feet in
area, exclusive of access drives or aisles, and a minimum of eight feet (8') in
width and sixteen feet (16') in length so long as each such parking space is
designated in plain view as for use of compact cars only. The parking space
shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven feet (7').
   B.   Width of access drives:
      1.   All off-street parking areas shall be laid out with the following
minimum aisle or access drive widths:
         a.   Ninety (90) degree (perpendicular) parking: twenty two feet (22')
(either one or two-way circulation);
         b.   Sixty (60) degree (angle) parking: fifteen (15) feet (one-way
circulation only);
         c.   Forty-five (45) (angle) parking: twelve (12) feet (one way-
circulation only);
         d.   Thirty (30) degree (angle) parking: eleven (11) feet (one-way
circulation only);
         e.   Zero degree (parallel) parking: 12 feet (one-way circulation).
      2.   When any combination of these types of parking is used (facing the
same aisle), the most restricted aisle or access drive width requirements shall
prevail. In addition, a two foot (2') overhang may be permitted on the external
sides of a parking area. If the width of the parking space is increased over
nine feet (9'), the drive aisle width can be decreased two feet (2') in width
in drive the aisle per one foot (1') increase in space width, except that a
drive aisle for two-way traffic may not be decreased below twenty feet (20') in
width and a drive aisle for one-way traffic may not be decreased below eleven
feet (11') in width.
   C.   Access to off-street parking spaces: access to off-street parking
spaces. Each required parking space shall be connected with a deeded public
right-of-way by means of aisles or access drives as required by division B. of
this section. The parking area shall be so designated to ensure that all
maneuvering into and out of each parking space shall take place entirely within
property lines of lots, garages, or storage areas.
   D.   Off-street parking areas in multi-family, commercial, or Industrial
zones: all such parking areas shall have a protective wall or bumper blocks
around the perimeter of the parking area and shall be so designed that all
vehicles leaving the facility will be traveling forward to approaching traffic.
All perking shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on
any property situated in a zone permitting single-family residential
development, by a solid wall, fence or densely planted compact hedge as
regulated by § 154.052. Ground cover shrubs and trees shall be located and
maintained so as to not interfere with vehicular and pedestrian traffic on the
property or with sight distance clearances at entrances and exits.
   E.   Lighting: any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas
shall not glare upon any right-of-way or adjacent property.
   F.   Paving of new off-street parking: all new off-street parking facilities
shall be paved with asphalt concrete or Portland Cement concrete and shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with the applicable standards adopted by
the city council.

SECTION 11.4 ACCESS CONTROL REGULATIONS.
   In order to promote greater safety of passage between highway and land;
improve the convenience and ease of movement of travelers on the highway;
permit reasonable speeds and economy of travel; and increase and protect the
capacity of the highway, the location and design of access points shall be in
accordance with the following access control requirements, these requirements
shall apply to all arterial and collector type streets as identified in the
adopted Comprehensive Plan:
   A.   Provision of reserved turning lanes: at those access points where
vehicles turning to and from the arterial and collector streets will affect the
roadway capacity reserved turn lanes shall be constructed by the developer.
   B.   Provision of frontage road: where possible, provision for the
construction of a frontage road shall be made. However, access to the arterial
or collector streets via an intersecting street or a common driveway shall be
investigated if the design is not reasonable.
   C.   Coordination of access ponts: major access points on opposite sides of
the arterial and collector streets shall be located opposite each other,
otherwise turning movement restrictions may be imposed by the Planning
Commission or City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, whichever is applicable in
addition, in order to maximize the efficient utilization of access points,
access drive shall be designed, located, and constructed in a manner to provide
and make possible the coordination of access with and between adjacent
properties developed (present or future) for similar uses. As a condition of
approval for construction, use, or reuse of any access road, the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator may require that unobstructed and unencumbered
access, in accordance with the provisions of this appendix, be provided from
any access point to adjacent properties.
   D.   Spacing restrictions for signalized access points:
      1.   Access points which will warrant signalization shall be spaced a
minimum distance of 1/4 miles apart. The exact location of the signal light
shall be determined by a traffic engineering study which shall at least account
for the following variables:
         a.   Speed;
         b.   Traffic signal phasing;
         c.   Traffic signal cycle length;
         d.   Roadway geometrics; and
         e.   Accident experience
      2.   Provision for all turning movements to maintain the design capacity
of the roadway shall be required.
   E.   Sight distance: the location of access points shall comply with safe
sight distance requirements as provided in Table 1 of this section. The
centerline of all access points shall intersect as nearly at a 90 degree angle
as possible, but in no case shall the angle of intersection be less than 75
degrees or greater than 105 degrees, unless approved by the Planning Commission
or City inspector/Zoning Administrator, whichever is applicable, due to certain
exceptional conditions.
   F.   Location of un-signalzied access point:
      1.   Arterial streets.
         a.   Un-signalized access points shall be spaced a minimum distance of
600 feet apart. Turning restrictions or reserved turn lanes may be required.
         b.   One access point per existing tract will be permitted; however,
if the spacing requirements for a direct access point onto an arterial street
(as provided in division F.1.a. above) cannot be met, then an access point may
be located on a frontage road or on an intersecting local street, or share a
common driveway that meets the spacing requirements. In order for the
intersecting local street or frontage road to function properly, access onto
them should be controlled as follows:
            1)   Access points onto local streets intersecting an arterial
street shall be spaced a minimum distance of 100 feet, measured from point of
curb return to point of curb return, from the arterial street.
            2)   In areas zoned to permit commercial, industrial, or multi-
family residential use, access points from adjacent properties onto frontage
roads, shall be no less than 100 feet measured from point of curb return to
point of curb return from intersections of the frontage road with local or
collector streets.
         c.   Where the frontage of a tract is greater than 500 feet an
additional access point may be permitted; however, the type of access will
depend on the spacing requirements in division F.1.a. of this section. If the
frontage of the tract is large enough, then at least one of the access points
may have direct access onto the arterial street, provided the spacing between
the adjacent access points meet the requirements of division F.1.a. of this
section and all other requirements of this section. In the case where the
frontage allows only one point of direct access due to spacing restrictions as
provided herein, the second access point will be via a frontage road or an
intersecting local street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing
restrictions as provided along the arterial street.
         d.   If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the
requirements of this section, one access point shall be provided. However, all
such access points shall be considered a temporary right-of-way and may be
terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning movements, or caused to be
relocated by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator at that time as the
particular use served by the access point changes or the property is otherwise
provided an alternate means of access via a frontage road or an intersecting
local street or sharing of a common driveway. Provisions for the construction
of a frontage road, restricted turning movements, or other improvements, may be
required, as a condition to approval, in order to minimize the number of access
points and congestion to the adjacent street. In all cases where access points
are classified as temporary, the designation shall be duly noted on the plot
plan or site plan submitted for a zoning permit and also upon the deed of the
property in question.
      2.   Collector streets.
         a.   On two lane roadway, one access point per existing tract will be
allowed; however, if the frontage is greater than 500 feet, an additional
access point may be permitted. Furthermore, the minimum spacing between
adjacent access points on this type of facility shall be 100 feet, measured
from point of curb return to point of curb return, except in the case where the
street intersects another collector street or arterial street, then the access
points shall be spaced a minimum of 300 feet from the intersection.
         b.   On multi-lane roadways the spacing is dependent on whether or not
a barrier median exists (prohibiting left turn movements). If a barrier median
exists, access points may be spaced as close as 300 feet; however, certain
turning movements will be prohibited. If a barrier median does not exist, then
the minimum spacing of access points shall be 600 feet. In addition, some
turning movements may be prohibited.
         c.   One access point per existing tract will be allowed; however, if
the spacing requirements for a direct access point, as provided in division
F.2.a. of this section, cannot be met, then an access point may be located on a
frontage road or on an intersecting street or share a common driveway that
meets the spacing requirements.
         d.   If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the
requirements of this section, one access point shall be provided. However, all
such access points shall be considered a temporary right-of-way and may be
terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning movements or caused to be
relocated by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator at that time as the
particular use served by the access point changes, or the property is otherwise
provided an alternate means of access via a frontage road or an intersecting
local street or share a common driveway. Provisions for the construction of a
frontage road, restricted turning movements, or other improvements, may be
required, as a condition to approval, in order to minimize the number of access
points and congestion to the adjacent street. In all cases where access points
are classified as temporary, the designation shall be duly noted on the plot
plan or site plan submitted for a zoning permit and also upon the deed of the
property in question.
   G.   Width of access points:
      1.   In single-family residential zones, no access point width shall be
less than nine feet, nor more than 20 feet. In all other zones, access points
shall not be less than 12 feet, nor more than 48 feet in width. The width shall
be as measured from the point of curb return to point of curb return (or edge
of pavement if no curb exists) excluding the curb radius.
      2.   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator may modify (enlarge or
reduce) the width to provide for a more efficient and safe channelization of
flow of traffic.
   H.   Exceptions to access points requirements: where situations develop that
may require special treatment, the requirements as provided in §
11.3 first six types of uses, may be varied provided that a traffic engineering
report is prepared by a qualified traffic engineer, establishing that the
special treatment will have no adverse effects on the roadway safety and
capacity.
   I.   Access point problem areas: if after special study, it is determined
that the type of use or activity proposed would have an adverse effect on the
safety and capacity of the adjacent roadway, the access point spacing
requirements as contained in this section may have to be increased in order to
adequately solve the traffic movement.
   J.   Approval of access points required: plans for all access points and
modification access points thereto (including plans to use existing access
points where a change of use for any tract of land would generate more traffic
than the previous use, thus producing an adverse effect on the adjacent
roadway) shall be submitted to the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator and the
Northern Kentucky Area Planning Commission staff, at a scale not less than one
equals 100 feet. No action of approving or rejecting these plans by the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall be taken until a review and recommendation
of the plans has been made by the Northern Kentucky Area Planning Commission
staff. The plans shall show the location of all access points, and access
points within 600 feet in either direction.
The proposed access point shall include typical cross sections of pavement, the
base and subbase, proposed grade and storm drainage, and any other information
or plans that the circumstances may warrant. If the access points are being
located in conjunction with off-street parking or loading and unloading
facilities, then those plans shall also include parking and off-street loading
or unloading plans, in accordance with §§
11.0 through
12.2.
   K.   Approval of access points along state-maintained routes by Kentucky
Department of Transportation: a copy of the plans for all access points to be
constructed along a state-maintained route shall also be submitted to the
Kentucky Department of Transportation for review and approval during the same
time as plans are submitted to the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, as
provided for in §
11.3.
   L.   No access point plans shall be approved or permits issued for
construction by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator until these access
point plans have been approved by the Kentucky Department of Transportation.

ARTICLE XII OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING REGULATIONS
SECTION 12.0 OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING REGULATIONS.
   For all buildings and structures erected, altered, or extended, and all uses
of land established as specified therein, after the effective date of this
appendix, off-street loading and/or unloading facilities shall be provided as
required by the regulations herein. However, where a building permit has been
issued prior to the date of the adoption of this appendix, and provided that
construction has not begun within 90 days of such effective date, off-street
loading or unloading facilities in the amounts required by this appendix shall
prevail.
(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)
SECTION 12.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Spaces required:
      1.   a.   Every building, structure, or part thereof, erected and
occupied for uses permitted in commercial and industrial zones, including
conditional uses permitted in residential zones, involving the receipt or
distribution of vehicles, materials, or merchandise and having up to 5,000
square feet of gross floor area shall be provided with at least one loading or
unloading space. A study shall be prepared by the company or operator to
determine the additional loading or unloading space needs over and above the
first space required for the specific use proposed. In determining the number
of spaces needed, the study shall take into consideration the following:
            1)   Estimated and projected arrival and departure rates for
scheduled and unscheduled (random) trucks;
            2)   Estimated and projected length of truck stop duration for
loading or unloading of each truck;
            3)   Estimated number of trips by vehicle type (such as two axle
vehicles, semi-tractor trailers, and the like) and size.
         b.   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall review the study of
estimated and projected loading or unloading needs and make a determination if
the number of spaces provided is adequate for the use proposed.
      2.   If it is determined by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator,
based on existing conditions of the proposed site, the design of the building,
and the completed needs study, that additional loading or unloading spaces are
needed to accommodate the facilities than could be reasonably provided, the
City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall require that additional parking
areas, properly designed, to handle the parking of necessary trucks including
the maneuvering of the trucks to and from the necessary trucks including the

number of spaces and any storage of truck parking needed to accommodate the
loading and unloading of trucks for a specific use, a need exists, based on
operation of the specific use, to provide additional off-street loading and
unloading spaces or storage of trucks than was previously determined, the City

Administrator that the existing spaces are not adequate to serve the increase
in intensity.
   C.   Location of off-street loading and unloading area: all required loading
and/or unloading spaces shall be located on the same zoning lot as the use
served. However, permitted uses located in industrial zones may provide parking
areas for the storage of trucks waiting to be loaded or unloaded within 300
feet from each lot served, upon the approval of the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator, providing that the off-street storage of trucks are unable to be
provided on the same lot or contiguous to the same lot as the use being served
and further provided that the storage of trucks is located in the same zone as
the use being served. Loading or unloading areas may be located in the side and

the use of such space, shall be in violation of the provisions of this
appendix.
   F.   No building to be erected in off-street loading or unloading Space: no
building of any kind shall be erected in any off-street loading or unloading
space.

street loading or unloading spaces shall be so located as not to hinder the
free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk or street.
   C.   Other design features: docks are to be designed to facilitate efficient
loading or unloading. Platform heights should be 44 inches for light pickup and
delivery trucks and 48 through 52 inches for heavy trucks and trailers. The
dock area should be at least twice the total body floor area of the largest
number of trucks that can be docked at one time. Minimum dock overhead
clearance (including pipes, lights and the like) should be 12 feet.
   D.   Paving of off-street loading or unloading area: all off-street loading
or unloading areas, including spaces, maneuvering, and storage areas for truck

shall be operated in its entirety within a completely-enclosed building. In
the, I-1, I-2, I-4, and I-5 industrial districts, permitted uses shall be
operated either within a completely enclosed building or within an area
screened from view at the nearest district boundary, according to §§
15.0 through
15.2.
   B.   Landscaping:
      1.   In all industrial districts, all required yards shall either be open
landscaped and grassed areas or be left in a natural state, if acceptable to
the Planning Commission. If the area is to be landscaped, it shall be
landscaped attractively with lawn, trees, shrubs, and the like, according to
the initially submitted plans which were first approved of for the development
of such tract as a permitted use.
      2.   In areas to be used for off-street parking, the parking arrangement
and surfacing must likewise have been approved of for the development of such
tract as a permitted use. Any landscaped areas shall be properly maintained
thereafter in a sightly and well-kept condition. Parking areas shall likewise
be maintained in good condition. Any areas left in a natural state shall be
properly maintained in a well kept condition.
   C.   Noise:
      1.   For the purpose of measuring the intensity and frequencies of a
sound, a sound level meter shall be employed that conforms to specifications
published by the American National Standards Institute (specifications for
Sound Level Meters S1.4 - 1971, and Specifications for Octave, Half Octave, and
Third Octave Band Filter Sets S1.11 - 1966, American National Standards
Institute, 1430 Broadway, New Your, New York 10018, or the latest edition of
such standards, shall be used). In the enforcement of the regulation, noises
produced by the operation of motor vehicles or other transportation facilities
shall not be included in determining the maximum permitted decibel level. In
the I-P District, the sound pressure of noise radiated continuously from any
activity shall not exceed the value given in Tables I and 2 of this section, at
the location of any receiving land use. If the noise is not smooth and
continuous, one or more of the corrections in Table 2 of this section shall be
added or subtracted from each of the decibel levels given in Table 1 below.
      2.   In the I-1 District the sound pressure of noise radiated from any
activity shall not exceed the values given in Table 3 below in any octave band
frequency at any point on or beyond any lot line. If the I-P or I-1 Districts
adjoin a residential district, the maximum sound pressure level at any point on
the district boundary shall be reduced by six decibels from the maximum listed
in Table 3 below.
      3.   In the I-2, I-4, and I-5 Districts, the sound pressure of noise
radiated from any activity shall not exceed the value given in Table 3 below in
any octave band frequency at any point on or beyond the nearest district
boundary. If those districts adjoin a residential district, the maximum sound
pressure shall be reduced by six decibels from the maximum listed in Table 3
below.
      4.   In all districts, industrial noise shall be muffled so as not to
become objectionable due to intermittence, beat, frequency, or shrillness.
      5.   Table 1. Maximum permissible sound pressure level at specified
points of measurement for noise radiated continuously from a facility.
      6.   Table 2. Correction in maximum permitted sound pressure level in
decibels to be applied to Table 3.
      7.   Table 3. Maximum permitted sound pressure level in decibels.

Division of Air Pollution, Cincinnati Air Quality Region.
   E.   Humidity, heat or glare: in the I-P or I-1 districts, any activity
producing humidity, in the form of steam or moist air or producing heat or
glare, shall be carried on in such a manner that the steam, humidity, heat, or
glare is not perceptible at any lot line. In the I-2, I-4 and I-5 districts,
any activity producing heat or glare shall be carried on in such a manner that
the steam, humidity, heat or glare is not perceptible at or beyond any
residential or commercial district boundary. Detailed plans for the elimination
of humidity, heat or glare may be required before the issuance of a building
permit.
   F.   Exterior lighting: any lights used for exterior illumination, except
for overhead street lighting and warning, or traffic signals shall direct light
away from the adjoining zones.
   G.   Vibration: vibrations shall be measured at the lot line in the I-P and
I-1 districts and at the nearest district boundary in the I-2, I-4 and I-
5 districts. No vibration is permitted which is discernible to the human sense
of feeling for three minutes or more duration in any one hour. Vibration shall
not produce, at any time, an acceleration of more than 0.1 gravities or shall
result in any combination of amplitudes and frequencies beyond the “safe” range
of Table 7, United States Bureau of Mines Bulletin No. 442, “Seismic Efforts of
Quarry Blasting”, on any structure. The methods and equations of said Bulletin
No. 442, or any subsequent revision or amendment thereto, shall be used to
compute all values for the enforcement of these provisions. Detailed plans for
the elimination of vibrations may be required before the issuance of any
building permit.
   H.   Emissions and open burning: no emission of particulate matter, sulfur
compound, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, and open burning shall
be allowed in all industrial zones in excess of regulations adopted by the
Kentucky Department for Natural Resources and Environmental Protection,

violation and the reasons why the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator believes
there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the
alleged violation to the satisfaction of the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator within 30 consecutive calendar days of receipt of the
notification. The notice shall state that failure to reply or to correct the
alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Commission within 30
consecutive calendar days of receipt of the notice constitutes admission of
violation of the terms of this appendix.
   B.   The notice shall further state that upon request of those to whom said
notice is directed, a technical investigation will be made by a qualified
expert and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such
investigations shall be charged against those responsible for the violations,
in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is
determined that no violation exists, the cost of the investigation will be paid
by the City Council.
   C.   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days of receipt of
the notice, but the alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the
City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, he shall note “violation corrected” on his
copy of the notice, and shall retain it among his official records, taking such
other action as may be warranted.
   D.   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days of receipt of
the notice and the alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of
the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, within the established time limited,
he shall proceed to take or cause to be taken such action as is warranted by
continuation of a violation after notice to cease.
   E.   If a reply is received within 30 consecutive calendar days of receipt
of the notice indicating that the alleged violation will be corrected to the
satisfaction of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, but, requesting
additional time, the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator may grant an extension
if they deem it warranted in the circumstances of the case and if the extension
will not, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life, health, or property.
   F.   1.   If a reply is received within 30 consecutive calendar days of
receipt of the notice requesting technical determination as provided in this
appendix, and if the alleged violations continue, the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator shall call in properly qualified experts to investigate and
determine whether violations exist.
      2.   If expert findings indicate violations of the performance standards,
the costs of the investigations shall be assessed against the properties or
persons responsible for the violations in addition to such other penalties as
may be appropriate under the terms of §
18.10.
      3.   If no violation is found, the costs of the investigations shall be
paid by the City Council without assessment against the properties of persons
involved.

those conditions shall be resubmitted to the Planning Commission for further
review and recommendations in accordance with the process required for the
initial review.

amended for the approved area.
         d.   1)   The City Council shall forward a copy of the approved
development plan to the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator and/or their duly
authorized representative for further processing in accordance with the
applicable requirements of this appendix.
            2)   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator and/or their duly
authorized representative, in reviewing the site plan, may authorize minor

increase overall density, alter circulation patterns (vehicular and
pedestrian), decrease the amount or usability of open space or recreation
areas, or affect other applicable requirements of this appendix.
      2.   Amendments: any amendments to plans, except for the minor
adjustments which may be permitted by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator

construction that constitutes initiating substantial construction shall be as
approved in the approved development plan.

   A.   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any final
action of the Board of Adjustment shall appeal from the action to the circuit
court of the county in which the property, which is the subject of the action
of the Board of Adjustment, lies. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days
after the final action of the Board. All final actions, which have not been
appealed within 30 days, shall not be subject to judicial review. The Board of
Adjustment shall be a party in any such appeal filed in the circuit court.
   B.   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any final

circuit court of the county in which the property, which is the subject of the
commission’s action, lies. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days after such
action. Such action shall not include the commission’s recommendations made to
other governmental bodies. All final actions, which have not been appealed
within 30 days, shall not be subject to judicial review. Provided, however, any
appeal of a Planning Commission action granting or denying a variance or
conditional use permit authorized by KRS 100.203(5) shall be taken pursuant to
this subsection. In such case, the 30 day period for taking an appeal begins to
run at the time the City Council grants or denies the map amendment for the
same development. The Planning Commission shall be a party in any such appeal
filed in the circuit court.
   C.   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any final
action of the City Council relating to a map amendment shall appeal from the

(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)
SECTION 18.4 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken,
certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal is filed with
him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by a court of record on application, or on
notice to the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken
and on due cause shown.
(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)
SECTION 18.5 POWERS OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   Upon appeals, the Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
   A.   To hear and decide on applications for dimensional variances where, by
reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of a site
on the effective date of this appendix, or by reason of exceptional topographic
conditions, or some other extraordinary situation or condition of that site,
the literal enforcement of the requirements (height or width of building or
size of yards, but not population density) of the zoning chapter would deprive
the applicant of reasonable capacity to make use of the land.
   B.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged, by the appellant, that
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by
the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this appendix. An
appeal shall be taken within 60 consecutive calendar days.
   C.   To hear and decide applications for conditional use permits to allow
the proper integration into the community of uses which are specifically named
herein which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone only if
certain conditions are met as specified in §
9.14.
   D.   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this appendix
requests for interpretation of the official zoning map or for decisions upon
other special questions upon which the Board is authorized to act upon.
(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)
SECTION 18.6 VARIANCES.
   A.   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide on
applications for variances. The Board may impose any reasonable conditions or
restrictions on any variance it decides to grant.
   B.   1.   Before any variance is granted, the Board must find that the
granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety,
or welfare, will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity,
will not cause a hazard or nuisance to the public, and will not allow an
unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In
making these findings, the board shall consider whether:
         a.   That the requested variance arises from special circumstances
exist which do not generally apply to land in the general vicinity, or in the
same zone;
         b.   That the manner in which the strict application of the provisions
of the regulation would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land
or would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant; and
         c.   The circumstances are the result of actions of the applicant
taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is
sought.
      2.   The Board shall deny any request for a variance arising from
circumstances that are the result of willful violations of the zoning
regulation by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning
regulations from which relief is sought.
   C.   The Board shall not possess the power to grant a variance or permit a
use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by the zoning
regulation in the zone in question, or to alter the density of dwelling unit
requirements in the zone in question.
   D.   A variance applies to the property for which it is granted and not to
the individual who applied for it. A variance also runs with the land and is
transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be transferred by
the applicant to a different site.
(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)
SECTION 18.7 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   A.   Conditional use permits shall not be issued without the specific
approval of the Board of Adjustment, as provided in this section.
   B.   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide on
applications for conditional use permits to allow the proper integration into
the community of uses which are specifically named in the zoning regulations
which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone only if certain
conditions are met:
      1.   The Board may approve, modify, or deny any application for a
conditional use permit. If it approves such permit it may attach necessary
conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more things be
done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature.
Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board’s minutes and on the
conditional use permit, along with a reference to the specific section in the
zoning regulation listing the conditional use under consideration. The Board
shall have power to revoke conditional use permits, or variances for
noncompliance with the condition thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have a
right of action to compel offending structures or uses removed at the cost of
the violator and may have judgment in personam for such cost.
      2.   Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant
from complying with all of the requirements of building, housing, and other
regulations.
      3.   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within the time limit set by the Board, or within one year, if no specific time
limit has been set, such conditional use permit shall not revert to its
original designation unless there has been a public hearing. “EXERCISED,” as
set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for the
construction of the main building or other improvement have been let; or in the
absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is under
construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving
substantial investment under contract, in development, are completed. When
construction is not a part of the use, “EXERCISED” shall mean that the use is
in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.
      4.   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall review all conditional
use permits, except for those which all conditions have been permanently
satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land
or structure where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that
the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the
conditional use permit. If the landowner is not complying with all of the
conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator shall report the fact in writing to the Chairperson of the Board
of Adjustment. The report shall state specifically the manner in which the
landowner is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit,
and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time
that it is furnished to the Chairperson of the Board of Adjustment. The Board
shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time, and notice of the
time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one
week prior to the hearing. If the Board of Adjustment finds that the facts
alleged in the report of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator are true and
that the landowner has taken no steps to comply with them between the date of
the report and the date of the hearing, the Board of Adjustment may authorize
the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator to revoke the conditional use permit
and take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity on
the land which the conditional use permit authorizes.
      5.   Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional use permit
and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely
and permanently satisfied, the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, upon
request of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that
the conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts which indicate that the
conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of
the conditional use permit which is on file. Thereafter said use, if it
continues to meet the other requirements of the regulations, will be treated as
a permitted use.
      6.   When an application is made for a conditional use permit for land
located within or abutting any residential zoning district, written notice
shall be given at least 15 days in advance of the public hearing on the
application to the applicant, City inspector/Zoning Administrator, the Mayor
and City Clerk of any city of the fifth or sixth class so affected, within any
county containing a city of the first class, an owner of every parcel of
property adjoining the property to which the application applies and such other
persons as the local zoning ordinance, regulations, or Board of Adjustment
bylaws shall direct. Written notice shall be by first class mail with
certification by the Board’s Secretary or other officer that the notice was
mailed. It shall be the duty of the applicant to furnish to the Board the name
and address of an owner of each parcel of property as described in this
division. Records maintained by the property valuation administrator may be
relied upon conclusively to determine the identity and address of said owner.
In the event such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership,
then the person notified by mail shall be the President or Chairperson of the
owner group which administers property commonly owned by the condominium or
cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two or more co-owners of an
adjoining property who are listed in the property valuation administrator’s
records as having the same address.
      7.   When any property within the required notification area for a public
hearing upon a conditional use permit application is located within an
adjoining city, county, or planning unit, notice of the hearing shall be given
at least 14 days in advance of the hearing, by first-class mail to certain
public officials, as follows:
         a.   If the adjoining property is part of a planning unit, notice
shall be given to that unit’s planning commission; or
         b.   If the adjoining property is not part of a planning unit, notice
shall be given to the mayor of the city in which the property is located or, if
the property is in an unincorporated area, notice shall be given to the judge/
executive of the county in which the property is located.
(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)
SECTION 18.8 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD.
   A.   In exercising the aforementioned powers, the Board of Adjustment may,
so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this appendix,
reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements,
decision, or determination as made by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator,
from whom the appeal is taken.
   B.   A simple majority of the total quorum of the Board of Adjustment, as
established by regulation or agreement, shall be necessary to reverse any
order, requirement, decision or determination of the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of
this appendix; or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which
it is required to pass under this appendix, or to effect any variation in the
application of this appendix.

showing it has taken action to remediate the code violation(s). If so, the Code

the remediation efforts undertaken and the date on which the daily fins were
suspended. This Officer may revoke the suspension if, in his or her opinion,

ARTICLE VI
DESIGN STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES FOR THE LAYOUT OF LAND SUBDIVISIONS
SECTION 6.0 STREETS.
   (A)   Conformity to comprehensive plan and/or official map. Whenever a tract
of land to be subdivided or resubdivided includes any part of a proposed
arterial or collector street as designated on the comprehensive plan and/or the
official map, such street right-of-way shall be platted by the subdivider in
the location so designated and at the width indicated in these regulations.
   (B)   Street extension.
      (1)   Existing streets. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions
shall make provisions for the proper continuation of existing streets in
adjoining areas.
      (2)   Adjacent property. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided and are
appropriate for future subdivision, arrangement of streets in new subdivisions
shall make provisions for the proper projection of streets to that adjoining
area in a manner which shall provide for the practical development of the
adjacent property, permit a feasible extension of the street, and be in general
conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of the entire
neighborhood.
      (3)   Half streets. Dedication of one-half of the rights-of-way (half
streets) for streets proposed along the boundaries by land to be subdivided,
shall be prohibited.
      (4)   Dedication of one-foot strip next to undeveloped or unplatted land.
A one-foot strip of land shall be required along the boundary line of
subdivision wherever the right-of-way line of a street forms such boundary next
to undeveloped land. All one-foot strips of land located on dedicated rights-
of-way shall be dedicated to the city for non-road purposes.
   (C)   Street classification and function.
      (1)   Arterial streets. Arterial streets should be planned for
continuation of movement of fast traffic between points of heavy traffic
generation and from one section of the community or communities to another.
Such arterial streets should traverse the entire community or communities and
should be spaced approximately one mile apart. Arterial streets should not
bisect neighborhoods but should act as boundaries between them. Abutting
properties should not face onto the roadway unless separated from it by a
frontage or service road.
      (2)   Collector streets. Collector streets should be designed to provide
a traffic route from local streets to arterial streets. These streets should be
designed to carry traffic which has an origin or destination within the
neighborhood and should be designed to inhibit through traffic.
      (3)   Local streets. Local streets shall provide direct and full access
to each lot and shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged. Local streets intersecting with arterial streets should be
discouraged.
      (4)   Frontage roads. Frontage roads may be required along an existing or
proposed arterial street to provide access to lots along such streets.
      (5)   Alleys. Where alleys are to be provided (e.g., in the case of
certain commercial development), they shall be designed to provide only
secondary access.
   (D)   Street rights-of-way.
      (1)   Widths and grades of new streets. Street right-of-way widths and
grades shall conform to the following minimum requirements:
TABLE 1.

* Arterial streets shall be based on current design standards and other
pertinent requirements of the Kentucky Department of Highways
 
      (2)   Existing streets. Subdivisions platted along existing streets shall
dedicate additional right-of-way, if necessary, to meet the minimum street
width requirements set forth in Section 6.0(D)(1) of these requirements. Such
dedication shall be in accordance with the following:
         (a)   At least the minimum right-of-way width shall be dedicated where
the subdivision is on both sides of an existing street.
         (b)   When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing
street, one-half of the required width, measured from the centerline of the
right-of-way, shall be dedicated. However, in no case shall the owner or owners
of such property be forced to dedicate from their land more than one-half of

215    DAYTON - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS    § 6.0
   (E)   Curves and sight distance criteria.
      (1)   Horizontal curve. Where there is a change in the alignment of a
street along the centerline, a curve with a radius adequate to insure safe
sight distance shall be made. The minimum radii of curves shall be:
 
Street Type Minimum Curve Radius
Arterial    *
Collector   300
Local       100
 
      (2)   Sight distance. A minimum sight distance of 200 feet shall be
provided for local streets and 275 feet for collector streets.*
      (3)   Reverse curves. A tangent at least 100 feet shall be provided
between reverse curves for local streets and 200 feet for collector streets.*
      (4)   Vertical curves. The minimum vertical curve length required shall
be calculated by multiplying the algebraic difference in grades, times a "K"
factor. Rounded "K" factors for the three street classification types are as
follows:*
 
Local     K=20 for both crest and sag curves
Collector K= 35 for both crest and sag curves
* Arterial streets shall be based on current design standards and other
pertinent requirements of the Kentucky Department of Highways
 
   (F)   Cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets.
      (1)   Dead-end streets designed to be dead-end permanently, shall not be
longer than 600 feet, unless local topographic or other physical conditions are
such as to render these provisions impracticable, and shall be provided with a
turning circle having an outside pavement diameter (curb face to curb face) of
at least 80 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. If
such street is of a temporary nature and a further extension into adjacent land
is anticipated, then said turning circle beyond normal street width shall be in
the nature of a dedication of the premises included in said turning circle, but
beyond the boundaries of the streets proper. Such dedications shall be vacated
to abutting property owners when said dead-end street is legally extended into
adjacent land. If such dead-end street extends only one lot depth past a street
intersection, no temporary turning circle will be required.
      (2)   In the case of dead-end streets extending to the boundary of the
property, a one-foot strip within the dedicated right-of-way shall be dedicated
to the city for non-road purposes. Such dedication or restriction shall be
vacated or removed when the dead-end street is properly extended.
   (G)   Street names.
      (1)   Duplication. The name of a new street shall not duplicate existing
or platted street names in Campbell County, or approximate such names in
spelling, or sound or pronunciation, or by the use of alternate suffixes such
as "Lane", "Way", "Drive", "Court", "Avenue", or "Street".
      (2)   Continuation of streets. New street names shall bear the same name
of any continuation of, or when in alignment with, an existing or platted
street.
      (3)   Approval of street names. All street names shall be approved by the
Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, before approval of
the final plat.
   (H)   Alleys.
      (1)   In commercial and industrial areas, adequate alleys shall be
provided where the design requires. Alleys shall not serve as part of the
required off-street parking, loading and/or unloading space required by the
zoning ordinance.
      (2)   Private streets. New private streets shall not be created or
extended and existing ones shall, whenever practicable, be dedicated to the
public.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 6.1 INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   Angle of intersection. The centerline of all streets shall intersect
as nearly at a 90-degree angle as possible, but in no case shall the angle of
intersection be less than 75 degrees or greater than 105 degrees (unless a
special modification is granted by the Planning Commission due to certain
exceptional conditions).
   (B)   Centerline offset of adjacent intersections. The use of four-way type
intersections shall be discouraged where possible and the use of T-
intersections shall be encouraged. Where T-intersections are used, the
following minimum centerline offsets of adjacent intersections shall be as
follows:
 
Type of Street        Minimum Centerline Offset of Adjacent Intersections in
                      Feet
Local - Local         50
Local - Collector     150
Collector - Collector 200
 
   (C)   Corner radii. Property lines at street intersections shall be provided
with a radius of not less than 15 feet. If because of certain exceptional
conditions, a modification is granted permitting an angle of intersection less
than 75 degrees, or greater than 105 degrees, then the minimum radii shall be
increased or decreased respectively.
   (D)   Grades approaching intersections. Grades approaching intersections
should not exceed 4% for a distance of not less than 100 feet from the
centerline of said intersections for local streets and 150 feet for collector
streets.
   (E)   Design adjacent to freeways, expressways or arterials. The following
principles and standards shall be used in the design of subdivisions adjacent
to freeways, expressways or arterials:
      (1)   Street design shall have the purpose of making adjacent lots
desirable by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic and of minimizing the
interference with traffic on such thoroughfares.
      (2)   The number of intersections with collector streets along said
thoroughfares shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable such
intersections shall be spaced not less than 1/4 mile apart. Frontage or service
roads shall be encouraged.
      (3)   Where frontage roads are not required, residential lots adjacent to
such thoroughfares shall be served by a local residential street paralleling
said thoroughfare at a generous lot depth therefrom or by a series of cul-de-
sacs or loop streets extending towards said thoroughfare from a collector
street.
      (4)   When the rear of any lot borders any such thoroughfare, the
subdivider or developer may be required to execute and deliver to the city, an
instrument, deemed sufficient by the city's legal counsel, prohibiting the
right of ingress and egress from said thoroughfare to said lot. This may be in
the form of a deed for a one-foot strip for non-road purposes.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 6.2 EASEMENT.
   (A) Utility easements. Public utility easements at least 15 feet in total
width may be required along the rear and sides of lots where needed for the
accommodation of a public utility, drainage, or sanitary structures or any
combination of the foregoing. Where deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, an additional easement width
shall be provided.
   (B) Watercourses. The subdivider shall dedicate rights-of-way or provide
easements for storm drainage purposes which conform substantially with the
lines of any natural watercourses, channels, streams, or creeks which traverse
the subdivision or for any new channel which is established to substitute for a
natural watercourse, channel stream or creek. Such rights-of-way or easements
shall be of a width which will provide for the maintenance needs of the channel
and incidental structures as determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 6.3 PHYSICAL CONSIDERATION.
   Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the topography of the
land, to economize in the construction of drainage facilities, to reduce the
amount of danger, to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil and to preserve
such natural features as watercourses, unusual rock formations, large trees,
sites for historical significance, and other assets which, if preserved, will
add attractiveness and value to the subdivision and the community.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 6.4 FLOOD HAZARDS.
   (A)   Prohibition of development in areas susceptible to flooding. Land
subject to flooding or otherwise uninhabitable shall not be platted for
residential, commercial, or industrial uses or for any other use which may
increase the danger of health, life, property, or aggravate erosion or flood
hazards. Such land within the subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for
such uses as will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or
will not result in conditions contrary to the public welfare (e.g., use as open
space, extensive recreation use, conservation purposes). To ensure that lots
will be located on land where they will provide flood-free sites, the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, may require the subdivider
to provide elevation and flood profiles sufficient to demonstrate the sites
will be free from the danger of flooding. Fill may be used in flood danger
areas to render lots habitable if such fill does not inhibit the flow of the
waters and thereby unduly increase flood heights in other areas and meets with
the approval of the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative.
Such information shall be prepared by a registered civil engineer.
   (B) Stream easement. If a stream flows through, or adjacent to, the proposed
subdivision, the plat shall provide for a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way along the stream for a floodway of at least ten feet. For the
smaller streams, the plat shall provide for channel improvement to enable them
to carry all reasonable floods within banks. The floodway easement shall be
wide enough to provide for future enlargement of the stream channels as
adjacent areas become more highly developed and run-off rates are increased.
   (C) Streets. Approval shall not be given for streets within a subdivision
which would be subject to inundation or flooding. All streets must be located
at elevations which will make them flood-free in order that no portion of the
subdivision would become isolated by floods.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 6.5 BLOCKS.
   (A) Arrangement. The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to provide for
convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. Blocks
intended to be used for commercial or industrial purposes shall be designed
specifically for such uses with space set aside for off-street parking and
loading and/or unloading facilities as required by the zoning ordinance.
   (B) Length. Blocks should not exceed 1200 feet.
   (C) Width. The width of blocks should ordinarily be sufficient to allow for
two tiers of lots except for double frontage lots as permitted in Section 6.6
(B)(4) of these regulations.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 6.6 LOTS.
   (A) Conformance to zoning. All lots shall conform to or exceed the
requirements of the zoning ordinance. Each lot shall front onto a publicly
owned street, other than an alley.
   (B) Lot frontage and width.
      (1) Arterial street frontage. No access onto an arterial street shall be
permitted from abutting properties except as provided for in Section 6.0(C)(4)
of these regulations.
      (2) Lot width. The lot width at the minimum building setback line shall
not be less than that specified by the zoning district in the zoning ordinance
controlling said lot.
      (3) Corner lots. Corner lots shall have extra width to permit conformance
to the setback line on the side street. In no case shall a corner lot be so
narrow that minimum zoning requirements of the zoning ordinance cannot be met.
      (4) Double frontage lots. Lots shall not be laid out so that they have
frontage onto more than one street except: (a) when the lots are adjacent to
the intersection of two streets; or (b) when the rear of the lot faces an
arterial, freeway, expressway, railroad right-of-way, etc. and the front of the
lot faces onto a local residential street.
   (C) Lot depth.
      (1) Conformance to zoning. Each lot shall be of such a depth that front
yard and rear yard requirements of the zoning ordinance, plus a reasonable
building site, shall be provided.
      (2) Maximum depth. The maximum depth of a lot shall not be greater than
three times the width of the lot, except lots which contain over five acres of
area. Lots containing over five acres of area shall not be less than 250 feet
in width at any location. Exceptional individual site conditions may require
variation from these requirements, as permitted by the Planning Commission, or
its duly authorized representative.
      (3) Extra depth and width in certain cases. Fifty feet in addition to the
required lot depth may be required where a residential lot in a subdivision
backs up to a railroad right-of-way, a high-pressure gasoline or gas line, an
arterial street, an industrial area or other existing land use which may have a
detrimental effect on the residential use of the property, and where no street
is provided at the rear of such lot. Where a residential lot has its side lot
line adjacent to any of the aforementioned, an appropriate additional width may
also be required.
   (D) Usable lots.
      (1) Building lots. All subdivisions shall result in the creation of lots
which are developable and capable of being built upon. No subdivision shall
create lots which are impractical to improve due to steepness of terrain,
dangerous soil conditions, locations of watercourses, or other natural physical
limitations.
      (2) Strips or parcels. No remnants of property shall be left which do not
conform to lot requirements, or which are not required for a private or public
utility purpose, or which are not accepted by the city and/or any other
appropriate public body for an appropriate use.
      (3) Side lot lines. The side lot lines of all lots so far as practicable,
shall be at right angles to the street which the lot faces or radial to the
center of curvature, if such street is curved. In the case of a cul-de-sac on
which the lot faces, side lot lines shall be as nearly radial to the center of
curvature of the cul-de-sac as practicable.
   (E) Large lots. When land is subdivided into very large parcels they should
be of such shape and dimensions as to render possible the re-subdivision of any
such parcels at some later date into lots and streets which meet the
requirements of these regulations and of the zoning ordinance.
   (F) Lot division. No lot shall be divided by a city or county boundary line.
   (G) Yard requirement. Yard requirements for lots within a subdivision shall
conform to the yard requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance for the
zoning district in which they are located.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 6.7 PEDESTRIAN WAYS.
   Where deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, pedestrian ways may be required and if provided, they shall not
exceed a 15% grade unless steps of an acceptable design, as determined by the
Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, are to be
constructed.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 6.8 PUBLIC SITES.
   Where a proposed park or other recreational area, school site, or other
public ground identified in the Comprehensive Plan is located in whole or in
part within the proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission may require a
reservation, as a condition precedent to final plat approval, not to exceed two
years, for the purchase of such public ground by the applicable public body. If
the city has adopted an official map and a short-term capital improvement
program (as provided for in KRS 100.293 through 100.317) which includes such
park or other recreational area, school site, or other public ground, then the
Planning Commission may require a reservation, as a condition precedent to
final plat approval, not to exceed five years, for the purchase of such public
ground by the applicable public body.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
ARTICLE VII
IMPROVEMENTS
   The improvements which are hereby required shall be prepared by a registered
civil engineer and installed by the subdivider in accordance with the
provisions of these regulations and other regulations of the city and state.
These improvements shall be installed before the final plat is approved (i.e.,
through conditional approval) or in lieu thereof, a bond certified by the
city's legal counsel as valid and enforceable by the city may be accepted and
shall be approved before approval of the final plat. Such bond would secure to
the city the actual construction and installation of such improvements within a
time required by the construction agreement and according to the approved
improvement plans.
   Prior to the commencement of any project involving the Planning Commission,
or its duly authorized representative, a preconstruction meeting will be held
with the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, to discuss
the project in regard to procedure, materials, inspections, etc.
SECTION 7.0 DRAINAGE.
   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider to
provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and the
drainage area of which it is a part. The following requirements and methods
shall be followed:
   (A) Storm drainage. A subdivision plat shall not be considered for final
approval until the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Commission, or its
duly authorized representative, a report by a registered civil engineer, as to
the ability of existing watercourse channels, storm sewers, culverts, and other
improvements pertaining to drainage or flood control within the subdivision, to
handle the additional run-off which would be generated by the development of
the land within the subdivision. Additional information shall be submitted to
adequately indicate that provision has been made for disposal of surface water
without any damage to the developed or undeveloped land downstream or below the
proposed subdivision. This report shall also include:
      (1)   Estimate of the quantity of storm water entering the subdivision
naturally from areas outside the subdivision.
      (2)   Quantities of flow at each pick-up point (inlet).
      (3)   Location, sizes, and grades of required culverts, storm drainage
sewers, and other required appurtenances.
   (B) Drainage requirements (grading).
      (1)   No final grading or sidewalk or pavement construction or
installation of utilities shall be permitted in any proposed street until the
final plat has been approved or conditionally approved by the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative.
      (2)   The subdivider shall grade each subdivision in order to establish
street, block, and lot grades in proper relation to each other and to
topography and further, a grading plan shall be prepared for the streets along
with street improvement details. The grading of the roadway shall extend the
full width of the right-of-way. Planting strips shall be graded at a gradient
of not less than 2% upward from the curb to the sidewalk or property line.
   (C) Drainage system requirements.
      (1)   The design criteria for storm drainage systems shall be based on
information from the "Manual for Instruction for Drainage Design" prepared by
the Department of Highways, Commonwealth of Kentucky, or any other acceptable
drainage manual.
      (2)   Culverts and storm sewers in all streets shall be designed for at
least a five-year storm frequency.
      (3)   For curbs and gutters, curb and gutter inlets and open channels an
intensity of four inches per hour shall be used in all computations.
   (D) Road drainage system.
      (1)   All roadways shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage
system.
      (2)   The road storm sewer system shall serve as the primary drainage
system and shall be designed to carry roadway, adjacent land, and building
storm water drainage. No storm sewer shall be permitted to be run into the
sanitary sewer system within the proposed subdivision.
      (3)   Curb drainage inlets and catch basins shall be provided at
intervals along roadways. Inlet spacing shall be adequate to limit the spread
of water to two feet into the roadway. Storm drainage inlets will be placed so
that crosswalks will not be flooded during the design storm intensity of four
inches per hour.
   (E) Off-road drainage systems. The design of the off-road drainage system
shall include the watershed affecting the subdivision and shall be extended to
a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage.
      (1)   When the drainage system is outside of the road right-of-way, the
subdivider shall make provisions for dedicating of an easement to the city to
provide for the future maintenance of said system.
      (2)   The size and location of all off-street watercourses or ditches
running through the subdivision shall be enclosed or left open subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative. If
a watercourse or ditch is left open it may be required to be protected by a
fence as determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative. The watercourse or ditch easement shall be wide enough to
contain ample clearance for the operation of maintenance equipment.
   (F) Drainage easement. Easements for drainage purposes shall be a minimum of
ten feet in width. Where the watercourse is large, easement widths shall be
increased as determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative. Where watercourses cross platted lots diagonally, the
subdivider should straighten such courses where practicable and should
substantially follow sublot lines. Easements shall be shown on the record plat
and shall cover all existing or reconstructed watercourses.
   (G)   Protection of drainage systems.
      (1)   The subdivider shall adequately protect all ditches to the
satisfaction of the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative.
Ditches and open channels shall be seeded, sodded, or paved depending on grades
(slopes) and types of soils.
      (2)   As a general rule, ditches and channels with grades up to 1% shall
be seeded, with grades from 1% to 4% shall be sodded, and with grades over 4%
shall be paved. Seeding, sodding and paving operations shall be in compliance
with the "Commonwealth of Kentucky, Department of Highways, Division of Design,
Guidance Manual" issued by the Kentucky Department of Highways.
   (H)   Material specifications. Material and construction specifications for
all drainage projects (i.e., pipe, tile, seed, sod) shall be in compliance with
the "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction" issued by the
Kentucky Department of Highways.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 7.1 SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
   The subdivider shall construct a sanitary sewage collection system designed
to serve adequately all lots in their subdivision plus lines adequate in size
to facilitate the orderly development of nearby land which is an integral part
of the neighborhood service or drainage area (See Section 7.12 of these
regulations) and connect said collection system to the public sewerage system.
   (A)   Plans required. When the subdivider submits the final plat for
approval they shall submit plans and specifications prepared by a registered
civil engineer showing the proposed sanitary sewerage system and facilities.
Said plans shall show pipe sizes, gradients, type of pipe, invert elevations,
location and type of manholes, the location, type, and size of all lift or
pumping stations and such other information as required by the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative.
   (B)   Design standards. The design criteria for the sanitary sewerage system
shall be based on the "Standards for Sewage Works" prepared by the Upper
Mississippi River and Great Lakes Board of Public Health Engineers and in
conformance with the requirements and/or guidelines of the State Water
Pollution Control Commission.
   (C)   Individual on-site disposal systems. Individual on-site disposal
systems may be permitted in areas zoned to permit development on a minimum area
of one acre with the approval of the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, and the County Health Department. The County Health
Department shall have the power to require greater than the one-acre minimum
aforementioned.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 7.2 WATER SYSTEM.
   (A)   The subdivider shall construct a complete water distribution system
which shall serve adequately all lots within the proposed subdivision plus
lines adequate in size to facilitate the orderly development of nearby land
which is an integral part of the neighborhood service area (See Section 7.12 of
these regulations). The water distribution system shall include appropriately
spaced fire hydrants, valves and other appurtenances necessary.
   (B)   When the subdivider submits the final plat for approval, they shall
submit plans and specifications prepared by a registered professional civil
engineer showing the proposed water system. Said plans shall show line sizes,
type of pipe, location of hydrants and valves, and other appurtenances, if
applicable, supply facilities, booster pumps, elevated or ground-level storage
tanks.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
SECTION 7.3 STREETS.
   (A)   Plans required. When the subdivider submits the proposed plat for
final approval, they shall submit plans and specifications prepared by a
registered professional civil engineer showing the proposed street system. Said
plans shall show the proposed right-of-way width, pavement width, location and
the proposed alignment, grade, geometric details, and cross sections of each
proposed street, curbs and gutters (where applicable), and sidewalks. Said
plans and specifications shall show for each proposed street, design criteria
such as street classification, pavement classification and thickness, and
classification and thickness of base and subbase materials. In addition, the
following information shall be required:
      (1)   The plans and profiles of all surrounding streets which are to
connect to a street in the proposed subdivision (for a distance of 100 feet
back from the boundary line of the proposed subdivision).
      (2)   All profiles shall be drawn at a scale of:
   1 inch = 100 feet horizontal   or   1 inch = 50 feet horizontal
   1 inch = 10 feet vertical   or   1 inch = 5 feet vertical
      (3)   Elevations shall be shown at all P.I. (s) and percent grade between

* Arterial streets shall be based on current design standards and other
pertinent requirements of the Kentucky Department of Highways.
** Parking shall be limited to one side of the street.
 
   (D)   Curbs and gutters. The developer shall construct vertical curbs, at
least six inches in height or roll curbs for all residential streets, except in
areas zoned to permit single family development on a minimum of one acre lots
or greater or any areas zoned for agricultural, conservation, commercial, or
industrial purposes, in which case the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, shall determine whether curb and gutter shall be
required. If curb and gutter is to be required on commercial or industrial
streets, they shall be vertical curbs. All curbs and gutters shall be
constructed of portland cement concrete and in accordance with the
specifications in attachment A of these regulations.
   (E)   Curb radii. The minimum curb radius at intersections shall be as
follows:
 
Type of Street* Intersection Minimum Curb Radius (in feet)
Local - Local                20
Local - Collector            25
Collector - Collector        30

Arterial - Arterial          50
* In the case of local or collector streets located in commercial or
industrial areas, the minimum curb radii shall be increased to 50 feet.
 
   (F)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of all local and
collector streets in all areas zoned for two- and multi-family development and
single-family development requiring 1/2-acre lots or less. The Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, shall determine the need for
sidewalks (on one or both sides of the street) in all areas zoned to permit
single family development at greater than a minimum of 1/2-acre lots or any
other zoning (i.e., commercial, industrial, agricultural, or conservation and
on all frontage and arterial roads). Sidewalks shall be constructed of portland
cement concrete in accordance with the specifications of Attachment A of these
regulations, at least five inches thick, where subject to vehicular traffic and
four inches thick where not subject to vehicular traffic. All sidewalks shall
be constructed with a minimum width of four feet and this width may be
increased to five feet for local streets in multi-family residential and
commercial and in industrial areas if deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, and also on collector
streets (typical cross sections are shown in Attachment C). Where pedestrian
traffic volume indicates the need, the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, may require wider sidewalk widths.
   (G)   Parking. Parking on any street where pavement width is less than 36
feet shall be limited to one side of the street. Parking lane shall not be
shifted from one side to the other from block to block or where the proposed
street is the extension of an existing street, parking lane shall extend
continuously on the same side of the street. If practicable, the parking lane
shall be located on the opposite side of the fire hydrants.

SECTION 7.12 PLANS FOR FUTURE EXPANSION-EXTRA SIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   All improvements shall be installed to satisfy the service requirements for
the service or drainage area in which the subdivision is located and the
improvements shall be of sufficient capacity to handle the expected development
of the overall service or drainage area involved.
   (A)   Extra-size improvements.
      (1)   Where improvements in excess of the size needed to serve just the
proposed subdivision are required, the subdivider shall pay for the total cost
of improvements that they are required to install to serve their subdivision
plus the additional costs which result from the extra size improvement required
as determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative.
      (2)   Thus, when conditions within the whole drainage area will require
an 18-inch sanitary sewer for example, and a 12-inch sewer will adequately
serve the subdivision involved, the subdivider shall construct the 18-inch
utility.
   (B)   Off-site extensions. When streets or utilities are not available at

representative, shall require, as a prerequisite to approval of a preliminary
and final plat, assurances that such improvement extensions shall be provided
as follows:
      (1)   Extensions of utilities onto the property involved shall be
adequate to serve the total development requirements of the service or drainage
area. Utilities leaving the property shall be constructed in such a manner as
to make their extension practical for servicing the adjacent areas of the
service or drainage area.
      (2)   If the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
finds that the extensions across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a
special assessment to the intervening properties or as a governmental expense
until some future time, the developer shall be required, if they wish to
proceed with the development, to obtain necessary easements or rights-of-way
and construct and pay for such extensions. Such improvements shall be available
for connections by subdividers of adjoining land and the subdivider may
contract with adjacent property owners and/or subdividers of adjacent land for
reimbursement of the oversize and/or off-site improvements constructed.

of any land proposed to be subdivided, developed, or changed in use by grading,
excavating or the removal or destruction of the natural topsoil, trees, or
other vegetative covering thereon the same shall only be accomplished after the
owner of said land or their agent has submitted to the Planning Commission, or
its duly authorized representative, for approval a plan for erosion and
sedimentation controls, unless there has been a prior determination by the
Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, that such plans are
not necessary (See Section 3.4(C)(5)). Such plans shall contain adequate
measures for control of erosion and siltation where necessary, using the
guidelines and policies contained herein. The Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, shall review these plans as submitted, and shall
take necessary steps to insure compliance by the developer with these plans as
finally approved.
   (A)   Requirements.
      (1)   Three sets of plans for the control of erosion and sedimentation
shall be submitted to the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, at the time the final plat drawings are submitted.
      (2)   Measures to be taken to control erosion and sedimentation shall be
described and provided for in the construction agreement and the estimated cost
of accomplishing such measures shall a be covered in the performance bond (as
per Section 7.19(B) of these regulations). In addition, the subdivider shall be
required to provide a cash escrow guarantee (to be held by a company which is
in the practice of handling escrows, approved by the City Council) in an amount
determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
which would insure the city that emergency measures could be taken by the city
at the subdivider's expense, if they did not initiate corrective action
determined to be needed by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative. In this regard the subdivider shall, at the time of final plat
submission, deliver to the City Council, written instructions addressed to the
escrow holder which shall authorize and instruct the escrow holder to convey to
the subdivider, after completion of the entire subdivision, (as per the
construction agreement) upon approval, by resolution of the City Council, the
cash guarantee or to convey to the city, when the City Council has approved
such action, by resolution, such amounts of the cash guarantee, as the
resolution requires.
      (3)   During the construction phase, further consultative technical
assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the Planning Commission, or its
duly authorized representative, or by the local representative of the Soil
Conservation Service. The Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, shall enforce compliance with the approved plans.
      (4)   The Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
shall make a continuing review and evaluation of the methods used and the
overall effectiveness of the erosion and sedimentation control program.
   (B)   Suggested control measures. The following control measures should be
used for an effective erosion and sediment control plan:
      (1)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one
time during development.
      (2)   When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be
kept to the shortest practical period of time.
      (3)   Where necessary, temporary vegetation and/or mulching should be
used to protect areas exposed during development.
      (4)   Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps)
should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from
land undergoing development.
      (5)   Provisions should be made to effectively accommodate the increased
run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development.
      (6)   The permanent final vegetation and structures should be installed
as soon as practical in the development.
      (7)   The development plans should be fitted to the topography and soils
so as to create the least erosion potential.
      (8)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected.

   (A)   Table A-2: Required Subdivision street thicknesses shows the required
pavement thicknesses for various street classifications for asphalt and
concrete streets where in situ subgrade soils can meet the minimum required
subgrade CBR equal to 2 or greater for Concrete pavements or CBR of three or
greater for asphalt pavements. These thicknesses were determined using the
AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1986 and 1993) and the design
parameters identified in Table A-1: Subdivision Pavement Design Parameters
Using AASHTO Method. These values meet requirements for a 50 year life cycle
without replacement, assuming resurfacing at 17 and 34 years.

or, where a number of residential units are served by more than one access,
it is an approximation of the number of residential units served that is
equivalent to one access.
- Example 1: A particular section street serves as the sole access to less
than 200 residential units. That street would then be a Local Street.
- Example 2: An area of existing and future residential development of 450
residential units is served by more than one access street. Only those
streets that will carry traffic and ESAL loading higher than a subdivision
street that provides sole access to more than 200 residential units will be
classified as a subcollector street.
[7] Geogrid shall be Tensar TX5 triaxial geogrid.
 
   (B)   Wherever the minimum CBR values for asphalt or concrete pavements as
defined in Table A-1: Subdivision Pavement Design Parameters Using AASHTO

submit an engineered subgrade improvement design that increases the CBR value
of the in situ subgrade soils to the required minimum CBR values for Asphalt
and Concrete pavement in Subsection A.1-1: Pavement Design Method; or 2) submit
an engineered alternate pavement design that takes into account the substandard
CBR values.
      (1)   Engineered subgrade improvements may include:
         (a)   Undercutting the substandard subgrade soils and replacing them
with documented soils that provide the minimum CBR values, or greater.
         (b)   Providing a chemically stabilized subgrade (usually lime
stabilization) to effectively provide the minimum CBR values, or greater.
         (c)   Utilizing crushed stone base with geotextile and/or Tensar TX5
triaxial geogrid to effectively provide the minimum CBR values, or greater.
      (2)   Alternative pavement designs may be proposed for Asphalt pavement
on subgrades with a CBR value of two, provided the pavement structure is shown
to meet the structural number requirements identified in Table A-3: Structural
Numbers for Alternative Asphalt Pavement Designs (CBR=2). Alternative pavement
designs are not permitted for subgrade soils with a CBR less than two; rather,
the subgrade soils shall be improved to CBR equal to two or greater, per
Subsection A.1-2(B)(1).

   (I)   Concrete pavement lugs. The purpose of pavement lugs in subdivision
pavements is to provide some additional resistance to contraction joints
separating during repeated expansion and contraction cycles over the life of
the pavement in certain open ended and relatively steep downhill pavement
conditions. In these open ended and downhill conditions, resistance to pavement
lengthening at contraction joints is substantially reduced as compared to
contraction joints in long stretches relatively straight pavement. In the long,
relatively straight streets, the repetitive adjacent slabs help keep the
contraction joints from separating during repeated expansion and contraction
cycles. Those conditions which shall require lugs are related to the geometry
of the Streets and are as follows (see Attachment C: Standard Construction
Requirements and Details for Streets, Sidewalks, Driveways).
      (1)   The ends of cul-de-sacs where the street grade approaching the cul-
de-sac decreases more than 20 feet vertically, at an average grade of more than
6%, before there is a change in direction of street drainage. In this
condition, install a lug near the end of the cul-de-sac across the extension of
the two lanes of pavement.
      (2)   At T-intersections, place a lug on the intersecting street near the
intersection, where grade on the intersecting Street is going up from the
intersection more than 20 feet vertically, at an average grade of more than 6%,
before there is a change in the drainage direction.
      (3)   On the main line of a street pavement where the pavement is going
straight and downhill more than 20 feet vertically, at an average grade of more
than 6% and the direction of centerline deflects horizontally by more than 30
degrees, place a lug just uphill of the start of the horizontal curve.
         (a)   Lugs shall be placed at least 20 feet uphill from any shallow
utility excavation transverse to the pavement.
      (4)   The design engineer may add other lugs in conditions he considers
critical to contraction joint integrity.
      (5)   Lug locations are to be shown on construction design and as-built
drawings.
   (J)   Joint sealing compound.
      (1)   Joint sealing compound shall conform to the following standard

case shall be steeper than 2.0 horizontal to 1.0 vertical.
   (D)   Any spongy, unstable, or organic material that is exposed at the
finished subgrade level must be removed to expose stiff, non-yielding, non-
organic soils and the excavated material replaced with soils capable of
producing the required subgrade CBR for the pavement design being used for the
project (see Section A.1: Pavement Design Method and Required Thicknesses of
these regulations).
   (E)   When excavating at the cut/fill transition during earthwork, remove
spongy or unstable material, organic matter, or other unsuitable materials that
are exposed. The contractor shall remove same to expose stiff, non-yielding,
non-organic soils and shall replace with approved materials, placed and
compacted in accordance with these regulations and the recommendations of the
geotechnical engineer.
   (F)   Excavations can be backfilled with the same soils that were removed,
provided they meet the requirements of Subsection B.2-3: Controlled Fill,
Subsection B.2-4: Trench Backfill, Subsection B.2-5: Shallow Trench Backfill,
and Subsection B.2-6: Deep Trench Backfill.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
B.2-3 CONTROLLED FILL OTHER THAN TRENCH BACKFILL.
   (A)   Construction of controlled fills shall be observed and tested by a
geotechnical technician. Density testing and reporting is required at a minimum
frequency of one density test per 500 cubic yards.
   (B)   Organic or vegetative soils shall not be used in the construction of
the controlled fill.
   (C)   Controlled fills shall be constructed of natural soils or bedrock to
approximate subgrade elevation in level lift thicknesses that are approved by
the geotechnical engineer. All shale used in controlled fills shall be
pulverized to a soil-like consistency and moisture-conditioned the same as a

fill so that it does not nest or impede compaction. The incorporation of
limestone floaters in the fill shall be in accordance with the recommendations
of the geotechnical engineer.
   (D)   Except for the top one foot of earthwork finished grades, which is the
pavement subgrade, controlled fills shall be constructed with soils that are
within 2% below to 3% above their optimum moisture content and compacted to a
firm, non-yielding condition and to dry densities at least 95% of the maximum
dry density, as determined by the standard proctor moisture-density test (ASTM

backfill material (the material above the granular utility conduit bedding and
cover material) is less than three feet deep to finish earthwork grade.
   (B)   Shallow trench backfill under the pavement and within a one horizontal
to one vertical projection downward from the bottom edge of curb shall be dense
graded aggregate (DGA), No. 57 crushed limestone (only when connected to a
drainage structure) or controlled low strength material (CLSM) as set out in
Attachment C: Details C.2 and C.3. Aggregates shall be compacted as shown in
the above noted details.
   (C)   Shallow trench backfill within the right-of-way but outside of the

(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
B.2-7 STREET PAVEMENT SUBGRADE.
   (A)   Subgrade preparation during excavation. Subgrade is defined as the top
one foot of the soils under the pavement. The pavement subgrade must provide
adequate support for the pavement structure as defined in these regulations.
      (1)   During earthwork and initial pavement subgrade preparation, the
geotechnical engineer or geotechnical technician shall evaluate in situ
pavement subgrade materials on the site and develop an opinion about their
suitability to provide the minimum CBR values when compacted to the required
densities at the specified moisture contents.
      (2)   Any soils identified as unsuitable to prove the minimum CBR values
will be removed from the subgrade and replaced with suitable soils, or
otherwise improved as recommended by the geotechnical engineer.
   (B)   Final subgrade preparations and testing.
      (1)   At the time of final subgrade preparation, density testing and
proofrolling before paving, the subgrade shall be within 2% of its optimum
moisture content and compacted to a firm, non-yielding condition and to dry
densities at least 98% of the maximum dry density, determined by the standard
proctor moisture-density test (ASTM D698, latest edition) or 89% of the maximum
dry density as determined by the modified proctor moisture-density test (ASTM
D1557, latest edition). Cohesive Subgrade material shall be properly knit
together and free of loose, dry, crumbly, baked or crusted soil material.
      (2)   The subgrade shall consist of cohesive soils, clean #57 crushed
limestone, crushed stone base, or controlled low strength material (CLSM). Any
aggregate material used to replace part of the cohesive subgrade soil must be
drained, so that no standing water can collect and be held in the aggregate
subgrade.
      (3)   Clean granular soils that do not exhibit a well-defined moisture-
density curve shall be compacted to a firm, non-yielding condition and to at
least 80% relative density as determined by the testing methods contained in
ASTM D4253 and D4254, latest edition.
      (4)   The subgrade shall be shaped to plan elevation and cross-section
and checked by the staff inspector for conformity with the cross section shown
on the approved improvement drawings immediately prior to placing the pavement.
Pavement shall not be placed on any part of the subgrade which does not conform
to the cross section shown on the approved improvement drawings.
   (C)   Final subgrade proofrolling.
      (1)   Subgrade proofrolling is the final test to be performed immediately
prior to beginning the paving operations.
      (2)   Prior to the placement of pavement materials and after confirming
proper density and moisture content of the subgrade soils, all street subgrades
shall be proofrolled to test the stability and uniformity of subgrade
materials.
      (3)   Subgrade proofrolling shall be performed with a dual axle dump
truck fully loaded with clayey soils or aggregate.
      (4)   Subgrade proofrolling shall be performed at walking speed with at
least two passes made in each drive lane direction with the outside wheel
generally traveling along the inside line of the future curb during one pass,
and the wheel-paths offset one-half of the truck width during the second pass
to maximize subgrade coverage. Extra proofroll passes shall be made at the
discretion of the staff inspector.
         (a)   Where proofrolling indicates areas of soft or unsuitable
subgrade soils or areas of non-uniform subgrade stability, the area shall be
delineated and repaired.
         (b)   Areas of soft or unsuitable subgrade soils or areas of non-
uniform subgrade stability shall be identified by observing pumping and/or
rutting. Pumping is defined as movement or deflection of the subgrade soil that
extends beyond the limits of the direct wheel load. Unless accompanied by
rutting (which is common), the pumping subgrade soil may rebound back to its
original position after the wheel load passes. Pumping failures are typically
caused by subgrade soils with higher than optimum moisture content located
within a zone up to several feet below the subgrade surface. Rutting is defined
as imprints or depressions in the subgrade caused by direct wheel loads.
Rutting failures are typically caused by inadequate compaction of near surface
soils.
         (c)   Rutting in excess of one inch in depth shall be deemed a
subgrade failure requiring subgrade repair.
         (d)   Pumping or deflection of less than one inch is acceptable so
long as the subgrade soil rebounds back to its original position after the
wheel load passes. Pumping or deflection greater than one inch or areas of
permanent deflections shall be deemed a subgrade failure requiring subgrade
repair.
         (e)   For larger areas of subgrade proofroll failure, the alternative
pavement design procedures in Subsection A.1-2(B) can be implemented by the
applicant.
      (5)   Subgrade repairs shall be performed by scarifying, aerating and
recompacting the subgrade soils. As an alternative, the failed subgrade soils
can be removed and replaced with properly compacted soils capable of producing
the required CBR value.
      (6)   In all cases, repaired areas shall be retested for compaction and
proofrolled again before proceeding with the placement of pavement materials.
Rutting can typically be repaired by scarifying, aerating, and recompacting,
while areas of pumping will more likely require a more significant repair with
depth often including the removal and replacement of unsuitable subgrade
materials.
   (D)   Final subgrade inspection testing and reporting requirements.
      (1)   Both the staff inspector and the geotechnical technician have final
subgrade review, testing, and reporting responsibilities.
      (2)   The geotechnical engineer shall provide soil testing to develop an
opinion of adequate bearing characteristics of the final subgrade soils. Those
tests will include, but are not limited to, moisture content testing, density
testing, and verification of soil types being adequate to produce the required
CBR values for the pavement. Moisture content testing, density testing, and
verification of soil types being adequate to produce the required CBR values
for the pavement shall be performed by the geotechnical engineer at intervals
no less than one test per 100 lineal feet of street for streets of 500 lineal
feet or less, or one test per 200 lineal feet for streets over 500 lineal feet.
      (3)   The geotechnical technician and the staff inspector shall review
the proofrolling described in Subsection B.2-7(C): Final Subgrade Proofrolling
and determine whether the subgrade passes the proofroll.
      (4)   Paving operations shall only be permitted to begin after passing
inspection results are achieved from Subsection B.2-7: Street Pavement
Subgrade, Subsection B.2-7(C): Final Subgrade Proofrolling, and Clause B.2-7(D)
(2). Inspection reports referenced in Clause B.2-7(D)(1) and Clause B.2-7(D)(2)
shall be placed in the staff project file and staff shall make their inspection
records available to the developer.
      (5)   Street paving shall occur within 30 hours after passing inspection
results are achieved from Clause B.2-7(D)(1) and Clause B.2-7(D)(2). A 1/4 inch
rain event or sub-freezing temperature occurrence between a passing proofroll
and street paving shall void the proofroll and geotechnical testing and shall
require re-evaluation.
      (6)   For concrete pavements, small pours of up to 100 square yards to
complete intersections, cul-de-sacs, etc. do not require subgrade
reproofrolling after initially passing a proofroll as part of a large subgrade
preparations and testing. Moisture conditioning and rerolling may be required.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-8-24)
B.2-8 CONTROLLED LOW STRENGTH MATERIAL.
   (A)   CLSM may be used in place of compacted clayey soils to uniformly
backfill utility trenches, manholes, etc.
   (B)   CLSM shall not be used in place of clean, free-draining #57 crushed
limestone specified for and intended as drainage backfill around catch basins
and manholes or in trench drains, such as between catch basin pairs.
   (C)   CLSM shall be transported by mixing truck to ensure proper suspension
when placed. Constant agitation is required.
   (D)   Flotation of pipes should be avoided by backfilling in eight to 12
inch lifts until fluid head subsides.
   (E)   Adequate separation from aluminum pipe, such as a bituminous coating,
is required.
   (F)   CLSM shall extend from the top of compacted bedding or other backfill
to bottom of pavement structure.
      (1)   CLSM placement shall begin no greater than six inches above the top
of the pipe.
   (G)   CLSM shall have a minimum excavatable strength of 20 pounds per square
inch at three days and 30 pounds per square inch at 28 days. CLSM shall have a
maximum excavatable strength of 100 pounds per square inch at 28 days for
potential future excavatability.

B.2-11 FINAL GEOTECHNICAL REPORTING.
   After the completion of all earthwork covered under this Attachment, for
each subdivision section that is constructed and is to be recorded, the
geotechnical engineer shall complete a final written report for that
subdivision section. The report will include the following:
   (A)   All relevant construction inspection results; and

§ 156.01 DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND PUBLIC POLICY.
   City Council finds as follows:
   (A)   That buildings and neighborhoods having historic, architectural or
cultural interest and value have been neglected, altered or destroyed
notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of preserving and continuing
the use of such buildings and neighborhoods and without adequate consideration
of the irreplaceable loss to the public.
   (B)   That the historic character of Dayton is of vital importance in
maintaining the economy of the city and that its historic buildings and
neighborhoods can be preserved, improved and used by means of appropriate
changes.
   (C)   That Dayton has we11-established residential and business districts
and that the history of the city is shown today through buildings representing
the activities and events during its growth. And that the city has buildings
and areas that represent the persons who live and work or have lived and worked
in Dayton during a period of more than one hundred (100) years. And that the
distinctive and significant character of this city can only be maintained by
protecting and enhancing its historic, architectural and cultural heritage and
by preventing unnecessary injury or destruction of its landmarks and historic
districts which are civic and community assets.
   (D)   That the federal and Kentucky governments have passed laws to protect
and preserve landmarks and historic districts, that some of these laws provide
incentives for historic preservation, and that the National Historic
Preservation Act permits the establishment of a certified local government
program creating a new federal-state-local partnership to encourage the efforts
by cities to protect and preserve their landmarks and historic districts.
   (E)   That individual historic preservation projects have already been
undertaken in Dayton and that this chapter will encourage additional
preservation work that will be important in achieving the goals of the city.
   (F)   That this chapter benefits all the residents of Dayton and all the
owners of property.
   (G)   That it is a matter of public policy that the preservation, protection
and use of landmarks and historic districts is a public necessity because they
have a special character or a special historic, architectural or cultural
interest and value and thus serve as visible reminders of the history and
heritage of this city, state and nation. Further it is a matter of public
policy that this chapter is required in the interest of the health, prosperity,
safety, welfare and economic well-being of the people.
   (H)   That the purpose of this chapter is to effect the goals as set forth
in the above findings and declarations of public policy and specifically, but
not exclusively, to:
      (1)   Accomplish the preservation, protection and use of historic
landmarks, landmark sites and districts having a special character or special
historic, architectural or cultural interest and value to this city, state and
nation;
      (2)   Promote the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of
the people and safeguard the city’s history and heritage as reflected in such
landmarks, sites and districts;
      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values in such districts and in the
city as a whole;
      (4)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable accomplishments of the
past;
      (5)   Strengthen the economy of the city;
      (6)   Protect and enhance the city’s attraction to residents, tourists
and visitors and serve as a support and stimulus to business; and
      (7)   Enhance the visual and aesthetic character, diversity and interest
of the city.

(Ord. 2007-4, passed 2-6-07)
§ 156.06 DESIGNATION OF LANDMARK AND LANDMARK SITES AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The City Council may request the Board to study a building or an area
in order to make a recommendation on whether it qualifies for designation as a
landmark, a landmark site or historic district. The owner of a property may
request the Board to study his or her building in order to make a
recommendation on whether it qualifies for designation as a landmark or
landmark site. Each designation of a landmark shall include the designation of
a landmark site.
   (B)   The Board shall assemble information about a property or district
being considered for designation and shall schedule a public hearing on the
proposed designation. Prior to the hearing the Chair or another member of the
Board may have an individual meeting with an owner or a tenant of a building
under construction for designation as a landmark or as a part of a historic
district. The purpose of these meetings shall be to explain the provisions of
this chapter and to answer questions about how a designation would affect the
owner or tenant. Prior to the hearing, the Board may hold an educational
meeting in an area or a neighborhood under consideration in order to explain
the provisions of this chapter and to answer questions.
   (C)   Advertised notice of the public hearing pursuant to KRS Chapter 424
shall be given, including conspicuous posting on the property or in the
proposed district for fourteen (14) consecutive days immediately prior to the
hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be given at least fourteen (14) days in
advance of the hearing by certified letters to the owners of property under
consideration and the owners of all adjoining property. Written notice shall be
considered sufficient when it is mailed to the owner at the address listed in
the records maintained by the Property Valuation Administrator.
   (D)   Before its first public hearing on a designation, the Board shall
recommend to City Council and gain approval for general guidelines that will
apply to Dayton’s landmarks and historic districts and will assist owners in
the preservation and rehabilitation of their property. The general guidelines
may include the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and may include other
guidelines that will apply to all designated property in the city. In its
guidelines and in its decisions the Board shall not limit new construction to
any one architectural style but shall seek to preserve the character and
integrity of the landmark or the historic district. The Board may expand or
amend the guidelines provided it holds a public hearing on the changes and
submits the proposed changes to the City Council for approval.
   (E)   A landmark or historic district shall qualify for designation when it
meets one (1) or more of the following criteria which shall be discussed in a
Board report making its recommendations to the City Council:
      (1)   Its value as a reminder of the cultural or archaeological heritage
of the city, state or nation;
      (2)   Its location as a site of a significant city, local, state or
national event;
      (3)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the city, state or nation;
      (4)   Its identification as the work of a master builder, designer, or
architect whose individual work has influenced the development of the city,
state or nation;
      (5)   Its value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that retains sufficient elements showing its architectural
significance:
      (6)   Its distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style
valuable for the study of a period, method of construction, or use of
indigenous materials;
      (7)   Its character as a geographically definable area possessing a
significant concentration of buildings or structures united by past events or
by its plan or physical development; or
      (8)   Its character as an established and geographically definable
residential neighborhood or business district, united by culture, architectural
style or physical plan and development.
   (F)   After evaluating the testimony at its public hearing, survey
information and other material it has assembled, the Board shall make its
recommendation to the City Council with a written report on the property or
area under consideration. In its report the Board may set goals for a proposed
historic district in order to encourage appropriate work in the district.
   (G)   The city’s Planning and Zoning Commission shall report on the
relationship between the proposed designation and existing and future plans for
the development of the city. If the Planning and Zoning Commission approves of
the proposed designation, it shall amend the Comprehensive Plan to include the
proposed designation and shall recommend a change in the zoning map to show the
proposed historic designation. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward
its comments, the Comprehensive Plan amendment and the zoning map change to the
City Council. If the Planning and Zoning Commission does not approve of the
proposed designation, it shall forward its comments to the City Council.
   (H)   The City Council shall approve, modify or disapprove the proposed
designation after receiving the recommendation of the Board and the material
from the Planning and Zoning Board. If the City Council decides to make a
designation and no Comprehensive Plan amendment has been adopted and no zoning
map change has been recommended, the City Council shall request the Planning
and Zoning Commission to reconsider its earlier decision, and shall provide
that the designation shall take effect after these preliminary steps have been
approved.
   (I)   The Board shall notify each owner of the decision relating to his or
her property and shall arrange that the designation of a property as a landmark
or as a part of a historic district be recorded in the land records of the
county. The Board shall also give notice of the decision to the government
offices in the city and county which shall retain them for future reference.
   (J)   The amendment or rescission of any designation shall be accomplished
through the same steps as were followed in the original designation.
(Ord. 2007-4, passed 2-6-07)
§ 156.07 APPROVAL OF CHANGES TO LANDMARKS, LANDMARK SITES, AND PROPERTY IN
HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   (1)   A certificate of appropriateness from the Board shall be

   (C)   In the event work is being performed without the required certificate
of appropriateness, the city shall issue a stop work order. All work shall
cease on the designated property. No additional work shall be undertaken as
long as such stop work order shall continue in effect. The Board shall meet
with the owner or tenant to resolve the problem. The city may apply in Circuit
Court for an injunction to enforce its stop work order.
   (D)   The Board shall hold a public hearing on each certificate of
appropriateness within thirty (30) days after a completed application is
received by the Board. The Board shall make a decision on the application
within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of a completed application
provided that the Board may extend the time for decision an additional sixty
(60) days when the application is for a demolition or new construction. The
Board shall approve or disapprove each application, and it shall give its
reasons for its decision using the criteria contained in this section and in
its guidelines. The Board may suggest modifications to an application and may
then approve a certificate of appropriateness providing for revisions in the
plans submitted. If the Board fails to decide on an application within the
specified time period, the application shall be deemed approved. Applicants and
all abutting property owners shall be given notice of the public hearings and
meetings relating to their application and shall be informed of the Board’s
decision all by certified mail addressed to the owner at the address listed in
the records maintained by the Property Valuation Administrator. Advertised
notice shall be given as required by KRS Chapter 424. When an application has
been approved, the applicant shall be given a certificate of appropriateness.
Advertised notice of the public hearing shall be given, including conspicuous
posting on the property.
   (E)   In making a decision on an application, the Board shall use its
guidelines. The Board shall consider: (1) the effect of the proposed work on
the landmark, the landmark site, or the property in the historic district upon
which such work is to be done; and (2) the relationship between such work and
other buildings and structures on the landmark site or other property in the
historic district. In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the Board
shall consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style,
design, texture, materials and color. The certificate from the Board shall not
relieve the property owner from complying with the requirements of other state
and local laws and regulations.
   (F)   In making a decision on an application, the Board shall be aware of
the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the applicant. The
Board shall also recognize the importance of approving plans that will be
reasonable for the applicant to carry out. Before an applicant prepares his or
her plans, he or she may bring a tentative proposal to the Board for its
comments. The Board shall prepare a list of routine alterations that shall
receive immediate approval without a public hearing when an applicant complies
with the specifications of the Board. The list shall include paint colors
appropriate for different types of buildings.
   (G)   Owners and tenants shall apply to the Board for a certificate of
appropriateness for a sign before their sign is made. In addition to its
guidelines, the Board shall prepare and distribute examples, of signs that
would be appropriate in a historic district. The Board’s standards for signs
shall be the standards used in a historic district but, also, shall not
conflict with the provisions of other local laws and regulations.
   (H)   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark, a building or
structure on a landmark site or a building or structure in a historic district,
the Board shall negotiate with the applicant to see if an alternative to
demolition can be found. The Board may ask interested individuals and
organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to demolition and in
obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs for the threatened building. After
its public hearing, the Board may decide that a building or structure in a
historic district or on a landmark site may be demolished because it does not
contribute to the historic district or to the landmark. On all other demolition
applications, the Board shall study the question of economic hardship for the
applicant and shall determine whether the landmark or the property in the
historic district can be put to reasonable beneficial use without the approval
of the demolition application. In the case of an income-producing building, the
Board shall also determine whether the applicant can obtain a reasonable return
from his or her building. The Board may ask applicants for additional
information to be used in making these determinations. If economic hardship or
the lack of a reasonable return is not proved, the Board shall deny the
demolition application unless the Board finds grounds to grant the demolition
application under the points contained in § 156.07(E).
   (I)   (1)   When an applicant wishes to have a landmark, a building or
structure on a landmark site, or a building or structure in a historic district
moved or when an applicant wishes to move a building or structure to a landmark
site or to a property in a historic district, the Board shall consider:
         (a)   The contribution the building or structure makes to its present
setting;
         (b)   Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated;
         (c)   Whether the building or structure can be moved without
significant damage to its physical integrity; and
         (d)   The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed
site and adjacent properties.
      (2)   These considerations shall be in addition to the points contained
in § 156.07(E).
   (J)   Within thirty (30) days, the applicant shall have an appeal to the
Circuit Court from a decision of the Board on an application for a certificate
of appropriateness.

§ 156.08 CONFORMITY WITH CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall
conform to the provisions of such certificate. It shall be the responsibility
of the building inspector and the Board to inspect from time to time any work
being performed to assure such compliance. In the event work is being performed
which is not in accordance with such certificate, the city shall issue a stop
work order. All work shall cease on the designated property. No additional work
shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect.
The Board shall meet with the owner or tenant to resolve the problem. The city
may apply in Circuit Court for an injunction to enforce its stop work order.

§ 156.09 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF LANDMARKS, LANDMARK SITES AND PROPERTY IN
HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   (1)   Every person in charge of a landmark, a landmark site or a
property in a historic district shall keep in good repair:
         (a)   All of the exterior portions of such buildings or structures;
and
         (b)   All interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may
cause such buildings or structures to deteriorate or to become damaged or
otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair.
      (2)   The purpose of this section is to prevent a person from forcing the
demolition of his or her building by neglecting it and by permitting damage to
the building because of weather or vandalism. No provision in this chapter
shall be interpreted to require an owner or tenant to undertake an alteration
or to restore his or her building to its original appearance.
   (B)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a landmark, a landmark
site or property in a historic district does not change its exterior appearance
that is visible to the public.
   (C)   An owner shall immediately notify the city of emergency conditions
dangerous to life, health or property affecting a landmark, a landmark site, or
a property in a historic district, and the owner shall immediately start and
complete the work required to make his or her property safe. In any case where
the city determines that there are emergency conditions dangerous to life,
health or property affecting a landmark, a landmark site or a property in a
historic district, the city shall order the remedying of these conditions
without the approval of the Board. The city shall promptly notify the Chairman
of the Board of the action being taken.
   (D)   The Board shall request a meeting with a property owner when his or
her landmark or his or her building in a historic district is in poor repair,
and the Board shall discuss with the owner ways to improve the condition of his
or her property.
   (E)   The provisions of this section are in addition to all other provisions
of all city, local or state codes applicable to building and property
maintenance.

§ 157.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish vacant property
registration requirements as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods, preserve
real property, prevent or lower maintenance costs and minimize hazards to
persons and property located within the city as a result of such vacancy.
(Ord. 2016-7, passed 7-5-16; Am. Ord. 2017-2, passed 3-7-17)
§ 157.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used herein, the following terms shall be defined, as follows:
   “ACTIVELY REHABBING.” Actively making repairs, alterations, additions, or
other improvements to a vacant property. Failure to conduct construction work
on such a property for more than seven consecutive days will be prima facie
evidence the property is not being actively rehabbed. Failure to obtain all
permits and license fees required by the Campbell County Planning and Zoning
Department, including building and zoning permits, and the City of Dayton,
including occupational license fees for contractors working on the property,
will be prima facie evidence that the property is not being actively rehabbed.
   “CREDITOR.” Any person or any federal or state chartered bank, savings bank,
savings and loan association, credit union or any other financial institution
or entity acting on behalf of the creditor named in the debt obligation
including, but not limited to, servicers.

agent hired by the property owner, placed by the property owner on the MLS
Multiple Listing Service, Zillow, or other similar online service, or
advertised by the property owner through signage on the property and/or in
media publications or online platforms.
   “VACANT.” Any real property having no legal resident or tenant. Evidence of
vacancy may include any condition that, on its own or combined with other
present conditions, would lead a reasonable person to believe that the property
is uninhabited. Such conditions may
    REAL PROPERTY
include, but are not limited to, overgrown or dead vegetation; accumulation of
flyers, mail or trash; rodent infestation; disconnected utilities; the absence
of window coverings or furniture; broken and/or boarded up windows and
entryways; neglect or lack of general maintenance; and, statements of
neighbors, delivery persons or government employees as to the lack of
occupancy. The abandonment or voluntary “walk away” by the owner of any
property in which any creditor holds a mortgage interest shall be considered as
evidence of vacancy.
   “VACANT PROPERTY REGISTRATION FORM.” A form that creditors and owners of
vacant property subject to the requirements of this chapter must complete and
submit as specified herein.
   “VACANT, FORECLOSED PROPERTY.” A vacant property upon which a creditor has

passed 9-7-21)
§ 157.03 REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Within ten (10) business days of a creditor filing a foreclosure
action on real property that is vacant at the time of filing or within ten (10)
days of the real property becoming vacant after the filing, the creditor shall
complete and submit a vacant property registration form to the City Code
Enforcement Director or his or her designee.
   (B)   For all other vacant real property, no later than sixty (60) days
after this property becomes vacant, the owner of this property shall complete
and submit a vacant property registration form to the City Code Enforcement
Director or his or her designee. If the property owner is actively rehabbing
the property or has publicly advertised it for sale or rental, the property
owner may request, in writing, that the city grant an additional sixty (60) day
extension to this registration requirement.
   (C)   Registration of any vacant real property under this provision shall
include the address of the real property, the name and address of the owner of
the real property, the name and address of the creditor who has instituted a
foreclosure action or the creditor’s authorized agent located within the
Commonwealth of Kentucky for acceptance any notice required herein, if
applicable.
   (D)   The creditor of vacant, foreclosed real property or owner of any
vacant real property shall notify the City Code Enforcement Director or his or
her designee within ten (10) business days of any change of information on the
vacant property registration form. The vacant property registration form shall
be maintained with accurate information until the creditor or owner notifies
the City Code Enforcement Director or his or her designee in writing that the
property has sold at a judicial sale, reoccupied or transferred to an
unaffiliated third party. The name and address of the new owner or individuals
occupying the property shall be provided in writing to the City Code
Enforcement Director or his or her designee.

§ 157.04 REGISTRATION FEES.
   (A)   The creditor of vacant, foreclosed property or the owner of vacant
real property shall pay an initial registration fee of five hundred dollars
($500) and if the property remains vacant for more than six (6) months
thereafter, then the property owner shall pay a second $500 registration fee,
and for each year after payment of the initial registration fee, the creditor
or property owner shall pay one thousand dollars ($1,000) annual registration
fee until such time that the foreclosure action is dismissed, the property is
sold at a judicial sale, the property is reoccupied or until the property is
transferred to an unaffiliated third party.
   (B)   If registering property under §
157.03(B), the same fee schedule set forth in §
157.04(A) shall apply; however, payment of the initial registration fee maybe
deferred by the property owner for ninety (90) days from the date of
registration if the real property is publicly advertised for sale or rental by
the owner or the property owner is actively rehabbing the property for
occupancy or resale. The city may grant a second deferment from paying the
registration fee for a period of another ninety (90) days upon written request
from the property owner to the City Code Enforcement Director or his or her
designee, but only if the real property is still publicly advertised for sale
or rental by the property owner or still undergoing rehab for occupancy or
resale and the property owner provides proof that a reasonable effort is being
made to sell or rehab the real property.

property shall constitute a violation and shall be subject to a civil fine in
accordance with the City's Civil Fine Schedule.

§ 158.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the definitions shall apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   “DISABLED.” A person with disabilities. For purposes of this chapter, the
term “DISABLED” shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Federal Fair
Housing Act and the American with Disabilities Act, i.e., is an individual who
has a physical or mental impairment that limits one (1) or more of the major
life activities of such individual, is regarded as having such impairment, or
has a record of impairment. While a person recovering from substance abuse is
considered a person with a disability under 42 U.S.C. § 3602(h), a person who
is currently engaged in illegal use of a controlled substance is not.
   “FAIR HOUSING LAWS.” The Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (“FHA”)
and the provisions of KRS 344.600 et seq., as may be amended from time to time
(collectively, “fair housing laws”).
   “GROUP HOME.” A residential facility for the care of seven (7) or fewer
unrelated individuals living in a single housekeeping unit and recognized as
disabled individuals under the Fair Housing Act and American with Disabilities
Act, or even fewer residents based on maximum occupancy restrictions
established by the International Property Maintenance Code. A sober-living
facility shall be considered as a “GROUP HOME” for all purposes consistent
herewith.
   “OPERATOR.” An individual or business entity, whether for profit or non-
profit, which provides residential services at a group home.
   “REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.” The act of making a dwelling unit or housing
facility(ies) readily accessible to and usable by a person with disabilities,
through the removal of constraints in the city’s building, zoning, land use,
permit, and processing procedures. All accommodations may not be reasonable,
and the reasonableness of a request will be determined by the city.
   “SOBER-LIVING FACILITY.” A single-family dwelling unit used by individuals
recovering from a drug and/or alcohol addiction, considered as a disabled
individual under state or federal law. A “SOBER-LIVING FACILITY” shall not
provide on-site supportive services to residents, including the following:
mental health services; clinical rehabilitation services; social services;
medical, dental, nutritional or other healthcare services; financial management
services; legal services; vocational services; and other similar supportive
services. See “GROUP HOME.”
(Ord. 2022-7, passed 5-3-22)
§ 158.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Fair housing laws impose an affirmative duty on local governments to
make reasonable accommodation in their building, land use, and zoning
regulations and practices when such accommodation may be necessary to afford
disabled individuals an equal opportunity for housing.
   (B)   In furtherance of the purposes of the fair housing laws, this chapter
is intended to preserve the residential character of single-family residential
neighborhoods; ensure that group homes, including sober-living facilities, are
actually entitled to reasonable accommodation; limit the secondary impacts of
group homes, including sober-living facilities, by reducing noise and traffic;
preserve safety and provide adequate on-street parking in residential areas;
provide an accommodation for disabled individuals that is reasonable and
actually bears some resemblance to the opportunities afforded nondisabled
individuals to use and enjoy a dwelling in a residential neighborhood; and to
provide a living environment that will enhance the opportunity for the disabled
to be successful in their programs. Pursuant to fair housing laws, this chapter
also is created to provide disabled individuals with reasonable accommodation
in rules, policies, practices, and procedures to ensure equal access to housing
and to facilitate the development of housing for individuals with such
recognized disabilities when these disabilities may act as a barrier to fair-
housing opportunities.
   (C)   This chapter establishes a procedure for making requests for
reasonable accommodation in building, land use, and zoning regulations,
policies, practices, and procedures to comply fully with the intent and purpose
of fair housing laws. Unless a group home has been granted reasonable
accommodation as provided in this chapter, group homes shall comply with all
building, land use, and zoning regulations, policies, practices, and procedures
applicable to the zoning classification in which they are located.
(Ord. 2022-7, passed 5-3-22)
§ 158.03 APPLICABILITY.
   Reasonable accommodation within the context of land use and zoning
regulations means providing individuals with recognized disabilities some
flexibility in the application of land use and zoning regulations, policies,
practices, and procedures, or even waiving certain requirements, when it is
necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.
(Ord. 2022-7, passed 5-3-22)
§ 158.04 NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC OF AVAILABILITY OF ACCOMMODATING PROCESS.
   Notice of the availability of reasonable accommodation shall be prominently

otherwise required by law.
      (14)   A request for reasonable accommodation to the regulations,
policies, practices and procedures may be filed at any time that the
accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. A reasonable
accommodation shall not affect an individual’s obligations to comply with other
applicable regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation.
      (15)   If an applicant needs assistance in making the request for
reasonable accommodation, it shall be provided to ensure that the process is
properly undertaken.
      (16)   An applicant may seek relief from the strict application of the
provisions of this chapter by submitting such request in writing to the Code
Enforcement Director (hereafter “Director”) setting forth specific reasons as
to why accommodation over and above the provisions set forth herein is
necessary.
      (17)   No fee will be charged for an application to obtain a reasonable
accommodation under this chapter.
(Ord. 2022-7, passed 5-3-22)
§ 158.06 GROUNDS FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.
   In determining whether to grant a reasonable accommodation, the Director
shall consider the totality of the following factors:

recognized disability an equal opportunity to live in a residential setting.
   (H)   The city shall consider the following factors upon any request for
accommodation:
      (1)   Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the
character of the neighborhood;
