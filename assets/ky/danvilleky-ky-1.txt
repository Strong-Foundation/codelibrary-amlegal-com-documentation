PREFACE
   This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the
City of Danville of a general and permanent nature.
   Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, and
ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The source of
each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the
end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and
was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the
Disposition and Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the
reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any
subsequent ordinance included herein.
   The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical
order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to
facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and
which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the
state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is
included at the back of this volume.
   Numbering System
   The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state
and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts
separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number
and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within
the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the
fourth section of Chapter 1 is 1-4. Under this system, each section is
identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole
chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal
system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of
one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired
to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3
respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new
material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as
Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of
chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new
divisions may be included in the same way, or in the case of articles, may be
placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the case of
divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the
next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
   Index
   The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care.
Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the
headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and
still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees.
There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as
guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.
   Loose-leaf Supplements
   A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is
especially directed is the loose-leaf system of binding and supplemental
servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date
periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be
properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted.
These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with
instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the
obsolete pages.
   The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend
largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will
then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted
according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the
publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to
avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and
filed for historical reference purposes.
   Acknowledgements
   The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Bill Carroll,
Supervising Editor, and Frances Ward, Editorial Assistant, of the Municipal
Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other
members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance
through the project.
   The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Edward D. Hays, City Attorney, Mr.
Ed Music, City Manager, and Ms. Dorothy VanGilder, City Clerk, for their
cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is
hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of
Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all
citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of
the City's affairs.

connected with and dependent upon the invalid part, that it is apparent that

commissioners.
(Ord. No. 1234, § 4, 12-13-77)

thereof, and such ordinances shall be deemed to be incorporated in this Code so
that reference to the Code of Ordinances, City of Danville, Kentucky, shall be
understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. Such
subsequent ordinances shall be numbered in accordance with the numbering system
of the Code and printed for inclusion therein, or in the case of repealed
chapters, sections and subsections, or any part thereof, by subsequent
ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission
from reprinted pages affected thereby and the subsequent ordinances are
numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie
evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that the Code of
Ordinances and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new
Code of Ordinances by the board of commissioners.
(Ord. No. 1234, § 6, 12-13-77)
§ 1-10. Altering Code.
   It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person to change or amend by
additions or deletions any part of the Code of Ordinances or to insert or
delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any
manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented
thereby.
(Ord. No. 1234, § 7, 12-13-77)
§ 1-11. Supplementation of Code.
   (a)   By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be
prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the board of
commissioners. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive parts of
permanent and general ordinances passed by the board of commissioners during
the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code.
The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into
the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or
partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have
been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the
latest ordinance included in the supplement.
   (b)   In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which
have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from
reprinted pages.
   (c)   When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the
person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make
formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included
in the supplement insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a
unified code. For example, the codifier may:
      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
      (2)   Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections
and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes
in such catchlines, headings, and titles;
      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be
inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change
existing section or other subdivision numbers;
      (4)   Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to
"this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be or to
"sections       to      " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections
of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated
into the Code); and
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of the ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no

(Code 1977, § 8.010)
   Cross reference--Definitions and rules of construction generally, §

§ 2-202. Procedures for requesting inspections.
   The following procedures shall be followed by both persons making a request
to inspect public records of this city and by the official custodian of those
public records:
   (1)   Initial request with immediate inspection. As defined in section
2-201 and subject to the limitations set forth in section
2-203, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of this city
shall make a request or complete a written application for such records at the
office of the city clerk during regular office hours, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00
noon and from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except
during legal holidays. A copy of the application is printed at the end of this
article. The application shall be hand delivered, mailed, or sent via facsimile
to the city clerk's office. If the custodian determines that a person's request
is in compliance with the open records law and that the requested records are
immediately available, the custodian shall deliver such records for inspection.
Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the city clerk for
the inspection and no person shall remove original copies of public records
from the offices of any public agency without the written permission of the
official custodian of record. The applicant may inspect public records during
the regular business hours of the city or by receiving copies of the public
records from the city through the mail if the applicant's residence or
principle place of business is outside of Boyle County and he has precisely
described public records which are available within the city. The applicant
shall have the right to make abstracts of the public records, and to obtain
copies of all written public records. When copies are requested, the custodian
may require a written request and advance payment of the prescribed fee as
defined in section
2-201.
   (2)   Referral to proper custodian. If the city clerk does not have custody
or control of the public record requested, the city clerk shall furnish the
name and location of the custodian of the public record, if such facts are
known to him.
   (3)   Non-Commercial purpose. Nonexempt public records used for
noncommercial purposes shall be available for copying in either standard
electronic or standard hard copy format, as designated by the party requesting
the records, where the agency currently maintains the records in electronic
format. Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
copied in standard hard copy format where agencies currently maintain records
in hard copy format. Agencies are not required to convert hard copy format
records to electronic formats.
   (4)   Format. The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as
not less than 8 1/2 inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white
paper, or for electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard
Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
   (5)   Commercial purpose requests. Unless an enactment of the General
Assembly prohibits the disclosure of public records to persons who intend to
use them for commercial purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are
requested for commercial purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable
fee. The public agency from which copies of nonexempt public records are
requested for a commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the
requestor stating the commercial purpose for which they shall be used, and may
require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract
shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a
specified fee. The fee may be based on the cost to the public agency of media,
mechanical processing and staff required to produce a copy of the public record
or records or the cost to the public agency of the creation purchase, or the
acquisition of the public records.
   (6)   Commercial purpose, unlawful. It shall be unlawful for a person to
obtain a copy of any part of a public record for a:
      (a)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (5) of this section: or
      (b)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (c)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
   (7)   Electronic access. Online access to public records in electronic form,
as provided under this section, may be provided and made available at the
discretion of the public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by
electronic means and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a
public agency may require that the party enter into a contract, license, or
other agreement with the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees
shall not exceed:
      (a)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (b)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (5).
   (8)   Public  records not immediately available. If the public record is in
active use, in storage, or not otherwise available, the official custodian
shall immediately so notify the applicant and shall designate a place, time and
date, for inspection of the public records, not to exceed three (3) days,
excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, from receipt of the
application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is given for further
delay and the place, time and earliest date on which the public record will be
available for inspection or duplication.
   (9)   Refusal of unreasonable requests. If the application places an
unreasonable burden in producing voluminous public records or if the custodian
has reason to believe that repeated requests are intended to disrupt other
essential functions of the public agency, the official custodian may refuse to
permit inspection of the public records or mail copies thereof. However,
refusal under this section must be sustained by clear and convincing evidence.
   (10)   Time limitation/denial of inspection. This city, upon any request for
records made under this article, shall determine within three (3) days,
excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the receipt of any such
requests whether to comply with the request and shall notify in writing the
person making the request, within the three-day period, of its decision. An
agency response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record shall
include a statement of the specific exception authorizing the withholding of
the record and a brief explanation of how the exception applies to the record
withheld. The response shall be issued by the official custodian or under his
authority, and it shall constitute final agency action. If the requesting party
wants the Attorney General to review the denial of a request for inspection of
a public record, he shall proceed under the provisions of KRS 61.880 and KRS
61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request, the agency will provide additional
documentation. If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the attorney
general reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or
in part, the request for inspection, the agency may institute proceedings
within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit
court. In addition, if the attorney general disallows the request or if the
city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the attorney general's
opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in circuit
court, the city shall notify the attorney general of such action.
   (11)   Concealing or destroying records. No official of the city shall
willfully conceal or destroy any record with the intent to violate the
provisions of this article.
   (12)   Access to public records. Any person shall have access, to any public
record relating to him or in which he is mentioned by name, upon presentation
of appropriate identification, subject to the provisions of section
2-203.

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this article, public records exempted under

is made to take no action. Provided, however, that the exemptions provided by

§ 1, 4-13-15)
DIVISION 2. PRINCIPLES OF CONDUCT
§ 2-263. Values.
   (A)   The values of any organization are reflected in the quality of the
decisions made. In a public service organization where a public office is a
public trust, the issue of ethics has particular importance.
   (B)   For the city to be an ethical organization, all official actions must
be based on a set of values. The city has developed a set of values to
establish an identity as a professional organization that is committed to doing
the right thing for the citizens of the city. The community vision statement
and the city mission statements all represent examples of the value system of
this city that drives our decision-making.
   (C)   There is no higher honor and privilege than government service. That
is why this city is dedicated to ethics in government. The guiding principle of
the ethics guidelines is simply to know right from wrong; to act in accordance
with what is right; and to avoid even the appearance of what is wrong. Our duty
as public servants is to always serve in the public's best interest and share
the conviction that we must do so only for the right reasons.
   (D)   It is the collective, individual actions of every member of this
organization that will dictate whether the city is considered ethical. This
evaluation will be based on the extent that our actions improve the community
(the "public interest"), rather than serve personal interest and gain. Each of
us is the organization called Danville City government in the actions and
decisions we make every day. There must be full confidence and trust in our
ability to do the right things for the citizens of the city.
   (E)   We must strive for professional excellence and exhibit at all times a
professional attitude based upon sound judgement free of personal biases.
   (F)   The most important responsibility of any city officer or employee is
to believe in, and then act upon, the shared values of the organization.
   (G)   Sections 2.264 - 2.267 further define the organization's values and
establishes the expectations of the city's ethics policy.
(Ord. No. 1504, § 5, passed 4-25-95)
§ 2-264. Personal honesty and integrity.
   Each officer and employee has a responsibility to the organization and his
colleagues to demonstrate the highest standards of personal integrity, honesty,
and fortitude in all public activities. It is in this way that we can inspire
public confidence and trust in city government. With this in mind we must avoid
any action, whether or not specifically prohibited, which might result in or
create the appearance of:
      (1)   using city position for private gain;
      (2)   offering preferential treatment to any person;
      (3)   impeding city efficiency or economy;
      (4)   losing complete independence or impartiality;
      (5)   making a city decision outside of official channels;
      (6)   affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity
of the city;
      (7)   comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, orders, and
regulations, and resolutions in carrying out of our responsibilities;
      (8)   eliminate any and all circumstances which could result in personal
gain from the performance of official duties; and
      (9)   avoid all interests or activities which are in conflict with the
conduct of official duties.
(Ord. No. 1504, § 5, passed 4-25-95)
§ 2-265. Open and accessible government.
   A primary responsibility and fundamental value must be open and honest
government. Our competence is encouraged by subjecting actions to the public
arena and ideas become better when we expose them to public scrutiny. It is
crucial that we maintain an organizational reputation for honesty and
integrity. In order to further our service goals, we must remain accessible to
the public at all times.
(Ord. No. 1504, § 5, passed 4-25-95)
§ 2-266. Fiscal responsibility.
   Proper use of public funds is a trust that must continually be guarded.
Public funds must be managed in the most efficient manner at all times. All
rules and regulations pursuant to their use must be adhered to.
(Ord. No. 1504, § 5, passed 4-25-95)
§ 2-267. Citizen service orientation.
   This organization recognizes that the chief function of local government at
all times is to serve the best interests of all the people. We are committed to
serve the public with respect, concern, courtesy and responsiveness,
recognizing that service to the public is beyond service to oneself.
(Ord. No. 1504, § 5, passed 4-25-95)

taking any action with respect to the matter that is the subject of the
disclosure.

changes that may hereafter be made in the laws of the Commonwealth with
reference to alcoholic beverages or other cause outside licensee's control,
then the city shall refund to licensee the proportionate part of the license
fee for the period during which licensee is prevented from carrying on said

Administrator that such period of inactivity was not the fault of the licensee
or the result of a revocation, suspension or other wrongdoing by licensee, or
an agent or employee of the licensee.
   (b)   In the event a violation of this chapter occurs that results in the
suspension or revocation of the license, the city shall not be required to
refund any portion of the license fee.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10)
Sec. 2.5-19   Regulatory license fee.
   (a)   Pursuant to KRS 243.075, there is hereby imposed a regulatory license
fee upon the gross receipts of the sale of alcoholic beverages of each
establishment located in the city licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. As of
the time of adoption of this chapter, the regulatory license fee shall be five
percent (5%) of gross sales of all alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. In
the case of retail sales of package distilled spirits and wine, the regulatory
license fee shall be four percent (4%) of gross sales. The regulatory license
fee shall be three percent (3%) on gross retail sales of package malt
beverages. Thereafter, pursuant to KRS 243.075, the City Commission shall adopt
at the budget adoption for each subsequent fiscal year, such annual rate for
the regulatory license fee as shall be reasonably estimated to ensure full
reimbursement to the city for the cost of any additional policing, regulatory,
or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the
city. Should the city fail to address the regulatory license fee in any budget,
then the regulatory license fee shall remain at the level at which it was last
fixed until such time as the City Commission shall adjust the fee.
   (b)   Payment of such regulatory fee shall be remitted to the City ABC
Administrator, and shall be held in a separate account maintained for the
purpose of fully reimbursing the city for the estimated cost of any additional
policing, regulatory or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic
beverages in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in addition to any
other taxes, fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit against a
regulatory license fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount equal to any
license fee imposed by the city pursuant to KRS 243.070. Payment of the
regulatory license fee shall accompany the tax return approved for such use by
the City Commission. The return and payment are due no later than by the end of
the month immediately following each calendar quarter.
   (c)   Failure to pay such quarterly remittance within ten (10) days of the
due date constitutes a violation and subjects licensee to suspension or
revocation.
   (d)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay quarterly remittance by
the due date is five percent (5%) of the tax for each ninety (90) days or
fraction thereof. The total late filing penalty shall not exceed twenty-five
percent (25%) of the tax; provided, however, that in no case shall the penalty
be less than ten dollars ($10.00).
   (e)   Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum will apply to any
late payments.

Sec. 2.5-32. Appeals.
   (a)   Appeals from the orders of the City ABC Administrator may be taken to
the state ABC Board by filing with the Board within thirty (30) days a
certified copy of the orders of the City ABC Administrator. The Board shall
hear matters at issue as upon an original proceeding. Appeals from orders of
the City ABC Administrator shall be governed by KRS Chapter 13B.
   (b)   When any decision of the City ABC Administrator shall have been
appealed, or when a protest has been lodged against an application for any
license within the city, and the ABC Board shall have made a decision regarding

of notice of finality of the decision, shall enter such orders and take such
action as required by the final order of the ABC Board. As provided by law, and
as used herein, no order of the ABC Board is final until all appeals or appeal
times shall have been exhausted. A “final order” of the ABC Board is the order
entered by said Board, unless an appeal is taken from the Board's order, in
which case the “final order” is the order entered by the Board upon direction
from the reviewing court of last resort in the final order of said reviewing
court.

   (d)   In addition to the above specified information, the applicant shall

process. The initial questionnaire adopted by the City Commission is a part of
this chapter and incorporated herein as Exhibit 4.3.3 A of Ord. 1765. The

order of the Commission hereafter. In addition to the information contained in
the application and any city ordered questionnaire, the City ABC Administrator
may require such other information as the Administrator may in his or her
discretion deem desirable, reasonable or appropriate to the consideration of
the application.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10)
Sec. 2.5-44. Other conditions.
   In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations required or
permitted by law:
   (a)   The City ABC Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage
license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his or her
place of business shall have been approved by the County Building Inspector,
Danville/Boyle County Planning and Zoning, Boyle County Health Department, and
City Fire Marshal;
   (b)   All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal background check
and shall sign a waiver allowing the release of this information to the City
ABC Administrator; and
   (c)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be granted or
renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any taxes or fees due
the city at the time of issuing the license, nor shall any license be granted
or renewed to sell upon any premises or property, owned and occupied by the
licensee upon which there are any delinquent taxes or fees due the city.
Further, if a licensee becomes delinquent in the payment of any taxes or any
fees due the city at any time during the license period, the license to sell
alcoholic or malt beverages shall be subject to revocation or suspension.
   (d)   No person, whether an applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in
any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the City
ABC Administrator, or any member of his or her staff, or any state ABC
administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This division is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or state ABC
Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a
license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for
appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this
section. This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit monetary settlements
in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order or
revocation or suspension, where the chapter and applicable statutes allow for
such payments in settlement.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10; Ord. No. 1896, § 5, 6-26-17)
Sec. 2.5-45. Form of license. 
   All city licenses shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the City
Commission and shall contain:
   (a)   The name and address of the licensee;
   (b)   The number of the license;
   (c)   The type of license;
   (d)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the licensed
premises;
   (e)   The name and address of the owner of the building in which the
licensed premises are located;
   (f)   The expiration date of the license;
   (g)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a property or
vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to law.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10)
Sec. 2.5-46.   Change of information.
   (a)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the City ABC Administrator within ten (10) days of the change.
   (b)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The
City ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
      (1)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other
business organization herein, the word “change” is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the
corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than ten
percent (10%) of the total ownership or stock shall require a new license.
      (2)   The following information will be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
         a.   Name and address;
         b.   Nature of interest;
         c.   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         d.   Date of birth;
         e.   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of
Kentucky. If a Danville, resident indicate when residence was established;
         f.   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license or
in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license under this act;
         g.   Extent of stock or company ownership;
         h.   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in
any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license in any other state or province.
      (3)   This information shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator as
a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten (10) days of any change of required
information.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10)
Sec. 2.5-47.   Renewal of license.
   (a)   Every year, except in the case of temporary licenses, each licensee
shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the City ABC
Administrator no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the
license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except
where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises
licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act
of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the
premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private
organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
exiting lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less than twenty (20) days from the expiration date of the
license, setting forth these facts, and the City ABC Administrator is hereby
authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a
reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the City ABC
Administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from
the expiration date of the former license or licenses. Said license fee shall
not by payable until application is made for the transfer of said license to a
new location.
   (b)   The renewal by the City ABC Administrator of the license shall not be
construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to
such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the licensee.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10)
Sec. 2.5-48.   Lost or destroyed license.
   When a license shall be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of the
licensee or his or her agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the original
license shall be issued by the City ABC Administrator after the Administrator
shall have been satisfied as to the facts; provided, however, that the
applicant for said duplicate license shall pay a fee of ten dollars ($10.00)
for the duplicate license.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10)
Sec. 2.5-49.   Revocation or suspension. 
   (a)   Any license may be revoked or suspended by the City ABC Administrator
per KRS 243.490 if the licensee shall have violated any of the provisions of
KRS Ch. 241 through 244, administrative regulation of the ABC Board relating to
the regulation of the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic
beverages or of the Department of Revenue relating to the taxation of alcoholic
beverages or if such licensee shall have violated or shall violate any act of
Congress or any rule or regulation of any federal board, agency or commission,
or this chapter now, heretofore, or hereafter in effect relating to the
regulation of the manufacture, sale and transportation or taxation of
intoxicating liquors or any rules or regulations of the city heretofore in
existence or authorized by the terms of KRS Ch. 241 through 244 to be created,
when an agent, servant, or employee of the licensee committed the violation,
irrespective of whether the licensee knew of or permitted the violation or
whether the violation was committed in disobedience of his or her instructions,
or any such license may be revoked or suspended for any cause which the City
ABC Administrator in the exercise of his or her sound discretion deems
sufficient.
   (b)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the City ABC
Administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had
been known.
   (c)   In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be revoked
or suspended for the reasons described in KRS 243.500.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10; Ord. No. 1896, § 6, 6- 26-17)
Sec. 2.5-50.   Proceedings for revocation or suspension of license.
   (a)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any
law enforcement officer or of the City ABC Administrator, the City ABC
Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license
granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after
the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered
mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such
proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in
opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or
in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
   (b)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall be prescribed by the Board of Commissioners of
the City of Danville by municipal order. Such order shall be maintained on file
in the office of the City ABC Administrator and a copy furnished with any
notice of proposed revocation or suspension sent to a licensee. If the
Commission shall fail to adopt such municipal order, the procedures shall be
those set out in the Kentucky Administrative Procedure Act (KRS Chapter 13B).
   (c)   A decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or suspending a
license may be appealed as provided in KRS 243.550.
   (d)   Within three (3) days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the City ABC Administrator.
If the revoked or suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the
licensee, the Chief of Police at the request of the City ABC Administrator
shall immediately cause one of his or her officers to take physical possession
of the license and return it to the City ABC Administrator.
   (e)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee may,
with prior approval of the City ABC Administrator, dispose of and transfer his
or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
   (f)   Appeal from the decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or
suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing of an appeal
shall stay further proceedings for revocation.
   (g)   If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the City ABC
Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at once
suspend all operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the entry of a
final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on
appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under this
license.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10)
Sec. 2.5-51.   Transfer or assignment.

as to licensee or location except with prior approval of the City ABC
Administrator and not then until a payment of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
shall be made to the City ABC Administrator.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10)
Sec. 2.5-52.   Refusal of license; guidelines for approval of quota licenses.
   (a)   The City ABC Administrator may refuse to issue or renew a license for
any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for suspension
or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for state
licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as violation of
any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or the
administration thereof.
      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of license
would be authorized; or
      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
   (b)   In the case of quota licenses, before approving an application, the
City ABC Administrator is hereby directed to consider, in addition to the
factors set out in KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, and any other factors the
Administrator determines in his or her discretion to be reasonable and
pertinent to the license application, the following criteria:
      (1)   Ownership. The City of Danville places great value on business
owners who are invested in the Danville community.
      (2)   Economic Impact. The City of Danville desires businesses which make
the most positive impact on the community, in number of jobs, payroll, property
investment and revenues to the city.
      (3)   Site of Business. The City of Danville is interested in serving all
geographic areas of the city. Therefore, the city does not wish to cluster all
licensed ABC outlets in one area.
      (4)   Aesthetics. The City of Danville is committed to protecting the
character and beauty of our community.
      (5)   Revitalization of Downtown. The City of Danville wholeheartedly
supports the revitalization of downtown and the revitalization and reuse of
existing buildings.
      (6)   Capital. The City of Danville values businesses that demonstrate
their ability to financially support and sustain their viability.
      (7)   Public support of licensed business in the area. The City of
Danville intends that public sentiment and safety be considered in deciding
upon the approval of retail liquor sales licenses in any area of the city.
   (c)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the City ABC
Administrator may appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KRS 241.200.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10)
Sec. 2.5-53.   Review of license; books, records, audio and visual recordings,
and reports.
   (a)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter shall
provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of
any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant's business income is earned from the sale
of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated
with the applicant's quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide
the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identify each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of
food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for
filing of reports notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the
premises of any licensee and examine the books, audio and visual recordings,
and records to determine whether the licensee is in compliance with all parts
of this chapter. In the event the conditions of any license requirement are not
met during any particular quarter, the City ABC Administrator shall have
discretion in determining whether revocation is appropriate or whether the
licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a
good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee, the City ABC Administrator
may apply an accounting period of at least one (1) year in determining whether
or not the food sale percentage requirement has been met.
   (b)   (1)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain upon
the licensed premises adequate books and records of all transactions involved
in the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the City ABC Administrator and such city
employees who may assist the City ABC Administrator in his or her review.
      (2)   For the purpose of assisting the City ABC Administrator in
enforcement of this chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC Board
under KRS 243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the City ABC
Administrator. Copies of any and all reports and correspondences to the ABC
Board required by statute shall be furnished to the City ABC Administrator.
(Ord. No. 1765, 4-12-10; Ord. No. 1822, § 4, 7- 22-13)
Sec. 2.5-54.   Dormancy.
   (a)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after ninety (90) days. Such is the intent of this
section. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her
business interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various
exceptions to the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
   (b)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of
ninety (90) days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth
in division (c) below are proved to the satisfaction of the City ABC
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the City
ABC Administrator.
   (c)   The provisions of division (b) hereof shall not apply to any licensee
who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a license is
issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of
the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency under
power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or
loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the
expiration of ninety (90) days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to
the City ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the fact that the
licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set
forth herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an extension of the
dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect during the license
period or until same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the
fact that no business is transacted during said period; provided, however, no
such license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted there under
within twelve (12) months from the date of notice to the City ABC
Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of
his or her sound discretion.

under the influence of alcoholic beverages, controlled substances, other
intoxicating substances, or any of these substances in combination, to the
degree that the person may endanger any person or property, or unreasonably
annoy persons in the vicinity to remain on the licensed premises. As used

ARTICLE VII. HISTORIC DISTRICTS
§ 4-171. Intent and declaration of public policy.
   (a)   The city commission finds that buildings within the city having
historic, architectural or cultural value have been significantly altered or
destroyed notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of preserving these
buildings or altering them in an appropriate way.
   (b)   The commission finds that the historic and architectural character of
the city is of vital importance in maintaining the economy.
   (c)   The commission finds that the city has played an important role in the
development of Kentucky and that the history of the city is shown today through
buildings representing the activities and events during its growth. The
commission finds that the city has buildings that represent the persons who
live or have lived in the city during a period of more than one hundred (100)
years. It is the finding of the city commission that the distinctive and
significant character of the city can only be maintained by protecting and
enhancing its historic, architectural and cultural heritage and by preventing
unnecessary injury to its historic districts and its landmarks which are civic
and community assets.
   (d)   The commission finds that the federal and Kentucky governments have
passed laws to protect historic districts and landmarks and that the national
Historic Preservation Act was amended in 1980 to establish a certified local
government program creating a new federal-state-local partnership to encourage
the efforts by cities to protect and preserve their historic districts and
landmarks.
   (e)   The commission finds that the adoption of this article to provide a
historic preservation program will benefit all the residents of the city and
all the owners of property.
   (f)   The city commission declares as a matter of public policy that the
preservation, protection and use of historic districts and landmarks are a
public benefit because they have a special character and historic,
architectural, and cultural value and thus serve as visible reminds of the
history and heritage of this city, state, and nation. The commission declares
as a matter of public policy that this article is required in the interest of
the health, prosperity, safety, welfare and economic well-being of the people.
   (g)   The commission finds that the Main Street program has contributed to
the revival of the central business district and has increased the awareness of
the value of the older buildings in the city. The commission also finds that
the historic preservation program will strengthen the current revitalization
work in the city.
   (h)   The purpose of this article is to effect the goals as set forth in the
above findings and declarations of public policy and specifically, but not
exclusively, to:
      (1)   Effect and accomplish the preservation, protection and use of the
historic districts and individual landmarks which have a special character and
historic, architectural and cultural value to the city, state and nation;
      (2)   Promote the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of
the people and safeguard the city's history and heritage as embodied and
reflected in its historic districts and landmarks;
      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values in such districts and the
city as a whole;
      (4)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable accomplishments of the
past;
      (5)   Strengthen the economy of the city;
      (6)   Protect and enhance the city's attractions to residents and
visitors; and
      (7)   Enhance the visual and aesthetic character, diversity and interest
of the city.

Register criteria, or the failure or refusal of the state historic preservation
officer to nominate a property recommended by the State Historic Preservation
Review Board. Such appeals shall conform to the requirements of 36 CFR Chapter

(Ord. No. 1479, 6-30-93; Ord. No. 1802, § 4, 4-23-12; Ord. No. 1838, § 4, 6-23-
14)
§ 4-176. Designation of historic districts and landmarks.
   (a)   Recommendations and designations. The board shall recommend to the
city commission the designation of historic districts and individual landmarks,
and the city commission may make these designations by the enactment of
ordinances. In addition, a property owner, any resident of the city, or any
organization may ask the board to study a property or an area and then to vote
on whether or not to start the process for designating it as historic.
   (b)   Public hearing and notice. To start the designation process, the board
shall assemble information about the district or property being considered for
designation and shall schedule a public hearing on the proposed designation.
Advertised notice of the hearing shall be given, including conspicuous posting
in the proposed district or on the lot of the proposed landmark or property for
fifteen (15) consecutive days immediately prior to the hearing. At least
fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing, written notice shall be given by
first class mail to the owners of property under consideration and the owners
of all adjoining property. The secretary of the board or other officer of the
board shall certify that the notices were mailed. Written notice shall be
considered sufficient when it is mailed to the person listed on the tax rolls
of the city. Owners and any interested person may present testimony and
evidence at the public hearing on the designation. The record on the
designation may also include letters received by the board.
(Ord. No. 1479, 6-30-93)
   (c)   Guidelines. Before its first public hearing on a designation, the
board shall adopt general guidelines that will apply to historic districts and
landmarks or property and will assist owners in the preservation and
rehabilitation of their property. The guidelines shall be submitted to the
planning and zoning commission and the city commission for their approval. The
guidelines shall include the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and may
include other guidelines that will apply to all designated property to the
city. In its guidelines and in its decisions the board shall not limit new
construction to any one (1) architectural style but shall seek to preserve the
character and integrity of the historic districts and landmarks or properties.
The guidelines shall suggest changes that would be appropriate for landmarks or
for property in historic districts and shall refer to appropriate work
completed on property in the city so that applicants may visit those sites. The
board may expand on or amend the guidelines it has adopted provided it holds a
public hearing on the changes and submits the proposed changes to the planning
commission and the city commission for their comments and approval.
   (d)   Criteria for designation. A historic district or a landmark or
property shall qualify for designation when it meets one (1) or more of the
following criteria which shall be discussed in a board report making its
recommendations to the city commission:
      (1)   Its character as an established and geographically definable
residential neighborhood, united by culture, architectural styles or physical
plan and development;
      (2)   Its character as a geographically definable area possessing a
significant concentration of buildings or structures united by past events or
by its plan or physical development;
      (3)   Its value as a reminder of the cultural or archaeological heritage
of the city, state or nation;
      (4)   Its location as a site of a significant local, state or national
event;
      (5)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the city, state or nation;
      (6)   Its identification as the work of a master builder, designer, or
architect whose individual work has influenced the development of the city,
state or nation;
      (7)   Its value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that retains sufficient elements showing its architectural
significance; or
      (8)   Its distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style
valuable for the study of a period, method of construction, or use of
indigenous materials.
   (e)   Report to the city commission. After evaluating the testimony at its
public hearing, survey information and other material it has assembled, the
board shall make its recommendation to the city commission with a written
report on the area or property under consideration. The report shall also
contain information about the buildings which have been identified for
inclusion in the proposed designation. The recommendation and the report shall
also be sent to the planning commission.
   (f)   Report by the planning commission. The planning commission shall hold
a public hearing, after which it shall report on the relationship between the
proposed historic district designation and existing and future plans for the
development of the city. If the planning commission recommends the approval of
the proposed historic district designation, it shall prepare a proposed overlay
for the zoning map showing said historic district. The planning commission
shall forward its comments and recommendation for the proposed zoning map
overlay addition to the city commission. If the planning commission does not
approve of the proposed designation, it shall forward its comments to the city
commission in the form of a recommendation.
   (g)   Action by the city commission. The city commission shall approve,
modify or disapprove the proposed designation and the map amendment within
sixty (60) days after receiving the recommendation for the proposed overlay
from the planning commission. If approved, the official zoning map shall be so
marked.
   (h)   Relationship to zoning. The property in a historic district shall be
subject to the zoning article and subdivision regulations and other rules of
its underlying zoning district. A landmark shall be subject to the zoning
article and subdivision regulations and other rules of its zoning district.
When there is a conflict between this article and the zoning article or
subdivision regulations, the higher standard shall govern. Upon establishment
of an overlay district, development within the area shall conform to all zoning
regulations applicable to the area and shall also conform to all historic
overlay district regulations.
   (i)   Notification of designation. The board shall notify each owner of the
decision relating to his property and shall arrange that the designation of a
property as a landmark or as a part of a historic district be filed by the
county clerk in the land records by owner's name and tax district lot and block
number. The board shall also give notice of the designation to the government
offices in the city and county which shall retain them for future reference.
   (j)   Amendment or rescission of a designation. The amendment or rescission
of any designation shall be accomplished through the same steps as were
followed in the original designation.
(Ord. No. 1479, 6-30-93; Ord. No. 1802, § 5, 4-23-12; Ord. No. 1838, § 5, 6-23-
14)
§ 4-177. Approval of changes to landmarks and property in historic districts.
   (a)   Requirement for certificate of appro priateness. A certificate of
appropriateness from the board shall be required before a person may undertake
the following actions affecting a landmark or a property in a historic
district:
      (1)   Alteration of the exterior part of a building or structure that is
visible to the public;
      (2)   New construction;
      (3)   Demolition; or
      (4)   Relocation.
   Any person applying for a building permit for a project involving designated
property must submit a certificate of appropriateness approving any work listed
in this section; however, a certificate of appropriateness for any work
described in this section is required even when the proposed work does not
require a building permit.
   (b)   Application to the board. The building inspector and/or the codes
enforcement officer shall refer to the board any person who proposes to
undertake an exterior alteration visible to the public, new construction, a
demolition or a relocation affecting a landmark or a property in a historic
district. The person shall supply the board with the information it requests in
order to reach a decision on his application for a certificate of
appropriateness. The applicant shall provide, where applicable, drawings of the
proposed work, photographs of the existing building or site and adjacent
properties, and information about the building materials to be used.
   (c)   Stop work order; injunction. In the event work is being performed
without the required certificate of appropriateness, the board shall direct the
building inspector to issue a stop work order. All work shall cease on the
designated property. No additional work shall be undertaken as long as such
stop work order shall continue in effect. The board shall meet with the owner
or his agent to resolve the problem. The city attorney may seek in circuit
court an injunction and any other appropriate relief in order that the intent
of this ordinance shall be carried out. The procedures authorized in this
subsection may also be used in the event work is being performed which is not
in accordance with the certificate of appropriateness issued by the board.
   (d)   Action by the Danville Architectural Heritage Board; notice.
      (1)   The board shall hold a public hearing on each application for a
certificate of appropriateness within forty-five (45) days after a completed
application is received by the board. The board shall make a decision on the
application within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of a completed
application; provided that the board may extend the time for decision an
additional sixty (60) days when the application is for a demolition or new
construction. Based upon the scope of the application, the board may require
the submission of any information they deem necessary to adequately review the
application, including but not limited to the following: a drawing of proposed
work, architectural plans, proposed signs, elevations of all visible portions
of proposed structures facing streets, photographs of existing building or
structure and adjacent properties, and information about the building materials
to be used. The board shall approve or disapprove each application, and it
shall give its reasons for its decision using the criteria contained in this
section and in its guidelines. The board may suggest modifications to an
application and where the suggested modifications are agreed upon by the owner
or his agent, the board may then approve a certificate of appropriateness
providing for revisions in the plans submitted. If the board fails to decide on
an application within the specified time period, the application shall be
deemed approved.
      (2)   Applicants shall be given notice of the public hearings and
meetings relating to their application and shall be informed of the board's
decision. When an application has been approved, the applicant shall be given a
certificate of appropriateness. Advertised notice of the public hearing shall
be given, including conspicuous posting on the property for five (5)
consecutive days immediately prior to the hearing.
   (e)   Criteria in deciding on applications. In making a decision on an
application, the board shall use its guidelines. The board shall consider:
      (1)   The effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the property in
the historic district upon which such work is to be done; and
      (2)   The relationship between such work and other adjacent or nearby
buildings and property. In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the
board shall consider historical and architectural significance, architectural
style, design, texture, materials, and color. The certificate from the board
shall not relieve the applicant from complying with the requirements of other
state and local laws and regulations.
   (f)   Consultation with applicants. Before an applicant prepares his plans,
he may bring a tentative proposal to the board for its comments. The board
shall be aware of the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of
the applicant. The board shall also recognize the importance of approving plans
that will be reasonable for the applicant to carry out.
   (g)   Routine alterations; ordinary maintenance and repairs.
      (1)   The board may prepare a list of routine alterations that may
receive a certificate of appropriateness without a public hearing, when an
applicant complies with the written guidelines of the board. At each meeting
the board shall be informed of the certificates of appropriateness that have
been issued under this provision. If any question arises as to compliance or if
staff or the applicant feels that the application raises issues deserving
review by the full board, the request shall be referred to the board for
action. The board shall not regulate the color of paint used on designated
property, but it may prepare and distribute material on paint colors
appropriate for different types and styles of buildings.
      (2)   Within the boundaries of a historic district a certificate of
appropriateness is not required for the following:
         a.   Ordinary maintenance and repair where the purpose of the work is
to correct deterioration to the structure or where no change is made to the
appearance of a building or site. Ordinary maintenance and repair shall
include:
            1.    Repainting a building the same color;
            2.    Replacement of window glass (but not the style or type of
windows);
            3.    Caulking and weather-stripping;
            4.    Installation of minor landscaping, including the planting of
vegetable and flower gardens, shrubs, and trees, except when part of overall
landscaping or replanting of yard space;
            5.   Pruning trees and shrubbery and removal of trees less than six
(6) inches in diameter;
            6.   Repairs to walks, patios, fences, and driveways, provided that
replacement material match the original or existing materials in detail and
color;
            7.    Replacement of small amounts of missing or deteriorated
original or existing siding, trim, roof coverings, porch flooring, steps, and
the like, as long as replacement materials match the original or existing
materials in detail and color;
            8.    Replacement of gutters and downspouts as long as the color
and shape matches the original;
            9.    Erection of temporary signs such as real estate and political
signs;
            10.    Installation of house numbers and mailboxes that are
compatible with the original in style, size and material; and
            11.   Repair of existing street or yard lighting.
         b.   Any construction, alteration, or demolition that only affects the
interior of the structure.
         c.   Any alteration of demolition undertaken by the city, or any
alteration or demolition that is necessary to correct or abate a condition that
has been declared unsafe by the Code Enforcement Department and where emergency
measures have been declared necessary by such department.
      (3)   Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a landmark or a property
in a historic district does not change its exterior appearance in any way that
is visible to the public. Every person in charge of a landmark or a property in
a historic district shall keep in good repair:
         a.   All of the exterior portions of such buildings or structure; and
         b.   All interior proportions thereof which, if not so maintained, may
cause such buildings or structures to deteriorate or to become damaged or
otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair. The purpose of this provision is
to prevent a person from forcing the demolition of his building by neglecting
it and by permitting damage to the building because of weather or vandalism.
      (4)   No provision in this article shall be interpreted to require an
owner or tenant to undertake an alteration or to restore his building to its
original appearance. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to the
provisions fo the Kentucky Building Code requiring buildings and structures to
be kept in good repair.
   (h)   Meetings with owners about condition of buildings. The board shall
request a meeting with a property owner when his landmark or his building in a
historic district is in poor repair, and the board shall discuss with the owner
ways to improve the condition of his property. After this step, the board may
request the building inspector to take action to require correction of defects
in any building or structure designated under this article so that such
building or structure shall be preserved in accordance with the purposes of
this article. Action taken by the city may include boarding up the doors,
windows and other parts of the building and additional steps to stabilize
walls, roofs and other parts of the building or structure.
   (i)   Emergency situations. In any case where the building inspector
determines that there are emergency conditions dangerous to life, health or
property affecting a landmark or a property in a historic district, he may
order the remedying of these conditions without the approval of the board. When
it is possible, he shall consult with the chairman or vice chairman of the
board about the action being taken. If consultation is not possible, the city
shall notify the board of the action taken after the completion of the work.
   (j)   Demolition of a landmark or a building or structure in a historic
district.
      (1)   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark or a building or
structure in a historic district, the board shall negotiate with the applicant
to see if an alternative to demolition can be found. The board may ask
interested individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an
alternative to demolition and in obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs
for the threatened building. After its public hearing, the board may decide
that a building or structure in a historic district may be demolished because
it does not contribute to the historic district.
      (2)   On all other demolition applications, the board shall study the
question of economic hardship for the applicant and shall determine whether the
landmark or the property in the historic district can be put to reasonable
beneficial use without the approval of the demolition application. In the case
of an income-producing building, the board shall also determine whether the
applicant can obtain a reasonable return from his building. The board may ask
applicants for additional information to be used in making these
determinations. If economic hardship or the lack of a reasonable return is not
proved, the board shall deny the demolition application unless the board finds
grounds to grant the demolition application under the points contained in
subsection (e).
   (k)   Moving a landmark or a building or structure in a historic district.
When an applicant wishes to move a landmark or a building or structure in a
historic district or when an applicant wishes to move a building or structure
to a lot containing a landmark or to a property in a historic district, the
board shall consider: (i) the contribution the building or structure makes to
its present setting; (ii) whether there are definite plans for the site to be
vacated; (iii) whether the building or structure can be moved without
significant damage to its physical integrity; and (iv) the compatibility of the
building or structure to its proposed site and adjacent properties. These
considerations shall be in addition to the points contained in subsection (e).
   (l)   Signage.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to encourage the use of well
designed signage within historic districts which will enhance the architectural
styles and historic atmosphere of the district, rather than detract from them.
It is recognized that commercial signage is, and always has been vital to the
character and livelihood of historic districts and their merchants. It is
recognized that poorly designed and haphazardly placed signage cannot only
destroy the atmosphere of historic districts, but can spoil their beauty and
character. The inclusion of signage in this ordinance is intended to supplement
the underlying zoning regulations in the zoning ordinance by establishing
additional design standards, guidelines and criteria for development within
historic districts to preserve, conserve, and protect the historical, cultural,
architectural, aesthetic, or other distinctive characteristics of a district.
      (2)   In addition to conforming to zoning sign regulations adopted by
reference in
Chapter 19 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Danville, a certificate of
appropriateness is required for proposed signs in a historic district. A
certificate of appropriateness must be obtained prior to the application for a
sign permit with planning and zoning.
      (3)   The board shall approve or disapprove each application for a
certificate of appropriateness for a proposed sign, and it shall give its
reasons for its decision using the criteria contained in this ordinance and in
its design guidelines, particularly the section titled “Signs”.
   (m)   Length of validity of certificate of appropriateness. A certificate of
appropriateness shall remain valid for one (1) year after it is issued. Work is
required to start before the end of the one (1)-year period. If actual work is
not commenced within one (1) year, the certificate shall expire on the one (1)-
year anniversary of issuance. Actual work is hereby defined to include the
placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition is required preparatory to
rebuilding, such excavation or demolition shall be deemed to be actual work
provided that it shall be carried out diligently.
   (n)   Appeal of the board's decision. The applicant shall have an appeal to
the board of commissioners of the City of Danville from a decision of the
Danville Architectural Heritage Board on an application for a certificate of
appropriateness. An appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days of the action
of the board.
(Ord. No. 1479, 6-30-93; Ord. No. 1802, § 6, 4-23-12; Ord. No. 1813, § 2, 12-
10-12; Ord. No. 1838, § 6, 6-23-14)
§ 4-178. Conformity with the certificate of appropriateness.
   (1)   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall
conform to the provisions of such certificate. It shall be the responsibility
of the building inspector and/or the codes enforcement officer and the board to
inspect from time to time any work being performed to assure such compliance.
In the event work is being performed which is not in accordance with such
certificate, the board shall direct the codes enforcement officer to issue a
stop work order. All work shall cease on the designated property.
   (2)   No additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order
shall continue in effect. The board shall meet with the owner or tenant to
resolve the problem. The city attorney may seek in circuit court an injunction
and any other appropriate relief in order that the intent of this ordinance
shall be carried out.
(Ord. No. 1479, 6-30-93; Ord. No. 1802, § 7, 4-23-12; Ord. No. 1838, § 7, 6-23-
14)
§ 4-179. Penalties.
   Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50), nor more
than five hundred dollars ($500) for each offense. Every day on which a
violation exists shall constitute a separate violation and a separate offense.
To the extent allowable by law, any violation of this article may be enforced
through the issuance of a civil citation, pursuant to KRS 65.8801, by a codes
enforcement officer.

Sec. 4.5-1. Scope and applicability.
   This chapter governs the regulation of cable television rates for basic
service and equipment for any cable operator providing service in the city
subject to regulations under the Act. This chapter is intended to be consistent
with FCC regulations, and the city intends to administer these regulations
consistent with those regulations, as required by the Act, 47 U.S.C. § 543(b).
Likewise, it is the city's intention that the cable operator be bound by the
FCC regulations to the extent allowed by law. For purposes of this chapter,
"basic service" or "basic cable service," and "cable operator" have the same
meaning as defined by the Act and FCC regulations. "Operator" shall have the
same meaning as "cable operator."
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-2. Notice of commencement of regulation.
   Upon adoption of this chapter and the certification of the city by the FCC,
the city shall notify all cable operators subject to the Act who provide
service in the franchise area of the city by certified mail, return receipt
requested, that the city has commenced to regulate the basic rates of the
operator.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-3. Rate filings by operator.
   Within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the city that it has
commenced regulation, the operator shall file with the city (the "rate filing")
a schedule of its current rates for basic service and equipment and
justification therefor. The operator may, if it so chooses, file a proposal
with appropriate justification for an increase in its current rates. An
"increase" shall mean any change, including the lessening of the number of
channels or other service available as well as raising the rate for basic
service or equipment. The operator may at any time thereafter submit a proposal
to increase its rates, consistent with FCC regulations.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-4. Support for rate filings: burden of proof.
   The rate filing submitted by the operator, either for its current rates or
for a change in its current rates, must show that the rates the operator
charges or proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable
and in compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations. The burden of
proof is on the operator to show that the rates are reasonable and in
compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations.
   (1)   If the operator asserts that its current rates or its proposed rates
are no greater than the maximum rate permitted by FCC rules, it must
fullycomplete applicable FCC forms and otherwise provide material to support
its position.
   (2)   If the operator claims that its present rate for which it is seeking
approval or a requested increase in rates is based in whole or in part upon the
adjustments for inflation and external costs contemplated by 47 C.F.R. §
76.922, it must supplement the information provided to the city on standard FCC
forms by providing:
      a.   Evidence of the basis of the inflation adjustment;
      b.   A statement itemizing each external cost claimed on the standard FCC
form, explaining how the external costs shown on the form were derived,
including the total cost to the operator for the external costs it claims, and
providing the basis for any allocation for the external costs between tiers of
service and any accounting and cost allocation decisions or adjustments made
pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.924.
   (3)   For any costs claimed to be for compliance with franchise
requirements, a clear and specific statement of what constitutes those costs,
both direct and indirect, and the basis of any allocation of general
administrative overhead or other costs to the franchise requirements. All
allocations and costs shall be computed and allocated in a manner consistent
with 47 C.F.R. § 76.925.
   (4)   The operator shall provide a sworn statement by the operator's chief
financial officer or an independent, certified accountant stating that he or
she has examined the filing submitted by the operator and that all rate
adjustments being sought on account of external costs are consistent with the
requirements of 47 C.F.R. § 76.922 and § 76.924, including any reductions in
external costs required as a result of deletion of channels, movement of
channels between tiers or substitution of channels.
   (5)   If the operator proposes to justify its rates by making a "cost-of-
service" showing it shall do so in accordance with rules and regulations
adopted by the FCC. In seeking to make a "cost-of-service" showing, the
operator must fully complete applicable FCC forms and otherwise provide
material to supplement its position.
   (6)   If the operator proposes to add or delete channels or service, or to
move certain channels from the basic service tier to the cable programming
service tier as defined by the FCC or to a non-regulated tier, it must explain
in writing the impact of the addition, deletion or removal on its basic service
rates and demonstrate why the addition, deletion or removal complies with FCC
rules and regulations.
   (7)   The operator must show why all rates for all customer classifications
are reasonable.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-5. Decreases in external costs.
   (a)   If it files under the quarterly system, the operator shall adjust its
rates in the next calendar quarter for any decrease in programming costs that
result from the deletion of a channel. The operator must adjust its rates
annually to reflect any decreases in external costs. The operator must also
adjust its rates annually to reflect any changes in external costs, inflation
and the number of channels on regulated tiers that occurred during the year if
the operator wishes to have such changes reflected in its regulated rates.
   (b)   If a cable operator is filing under the annual system, it must adjust
its rates every twelve (12) months to reflect any net decreases in external
costs.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-6. Approval of city necessary.
   Once an operator has been notified that the city has commenced regulation of
its rates, the operator may not thereafter increase its rate for basic service
or equipment without the prior approval of the city, except in accordance with
FCC regulations. This requirement applies in all cases, including increases the
operator has announced but not yet implemented prior to the date it received
notice of rate regulation from the city.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-7. Timing of rate filing.
   Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for
review at least thirty (30) days in advance of the proposed effective date of
the increase for operators filing, under a quarterly system or making a cost-
of-service showing and at least ninety (90) days in advance for operators
filing under the annual system.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-8. Notice to subscribers.
   The operator shall provide written notice to subscribers of any proposed
increase in rates at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-9. Information to be provided.
   In addition to any information it initially provides in support of its
current rates or request for increase in rates, the operator shall provide all
other information requested by the city, subject to a request for
confidentiality pursuant to Sec.
4.5-17. The operator shall provide all information requested in a timely

(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-10. Quarterly filing system or cost-of-service system; effective date
or rates; tolling periods.
   (a)   After the operator has submitted a rate filing to justify its current
rates, or to seek an increase, under the quarterly rate adjustment system, or
if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to 47
C.F.R. § 76.937(c) and § 76.92.4, the current rates will remain in effect
subject to further action by the city. If the city takes no action within
thirty (30) days of the date of filing to approve, disapprove or toll the
period for reviewing the rates, then the current rates or the proposed rates,
as the case may be, shall be deemed approved; provided, however, that the city
through the Mayor or his designee may toll the thirty (30) day period by
issuing a brief written order explaining that the city needs additional time to
request or review additional information or consider comments from interested
parties. The tolling order shall be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   For filings not involving cost-of-service showings, the city may
toll the rates for an additional ninety (90) days after the expiration of the
initial thirty (30) days.
      (2)   For filings seeking a rate increase based upon a cost-of-service
showing, the city may toll the rates for an additional one hundred and fifty
(150) days after the expiration of the initial thirty (30) days. If the city so
desires, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a cost-of-service showing, it
may ask the FCC pursuant to a petition for special relief under 47 C.F.R. §
76.7 that the Commission examine the cable operator's cost-of-service showing.
In such a case, the Mayor or his designee shall issue an executive order prior
to the expiration of the initial thirty (30) days stating that the city is
seeking Commission assistance. The city shall serve a copy of the order on the
cable operator.
   (b)   A tolling order shall direct the operator to keep an accurate account
of all amounts received by reason of the rates in issue and on whose behalf
such amounts were paid.
   (c)   If the operator seeks approval for setting a rate for a new type of
equipment pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.923(o), the city shall have sixty (60)
days from the date it receives the filing to review the requested rate or issue
an accounting order, pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.933(h).
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-11. Annual filing system: effective date of rates.
   (a)   If the operator seeks a change in its existing rates using the annual
filing system pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.922(e), it shall do so no later than
ninety (90) days before the effective date of the proposed rates. The city will
have ninety (90) days from the date it receives the filing to review the rates.
If the city or its designee concludes that the operator has submitted a
facially incomplete filing, the city's deadline for issuing a decision, the
date on which rates may go into effect if no decision is issued and the period
for which refunds are payable will be tolled while the city is waiting for the
requested information, provided that, in order to toll these effective dates,
the city or its designee must notify the operator of the incomplete filing
within forty-five (45) days of the date it receives the filing.
   (b)   If the city has taken no action within the ninety (90) day review
period, then the proposed rates may go into effect at the end of the review
period, subject to a prospective rate reduction and refund if the city
subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates.
If the operator inquires as to whether the city intends to issue a rate order
after the initial review period, the city or its designee must notify the
operator of its intent in this regard within fifteen (15) days of the
operator's inquiry.
   (c)   If a proposed rate goes into effect before the city issues its rate
order, the city will have twelve (12) months from the date the city received
the filing for the rate adjustment to issue its rate order.
   (d)   If the operator files for a rate adjustment under the annual method
for an additional rate adjustment to reflect channel additions to the basic
service tier pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.922(e)(2)(iii)(C), the city shall have
sixty (60) days from the date it receives the filing to review the requested
rate. The city shall follow the timetables and other requirements set out in 47
C.F.R. § 76.933(g)(4).
   (e)   If the operator seeks approval for setting a rate for a new type of
equipment pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.923(o), the city shall be subject to the
requirements of 47 C.F.R. Sec. 76.933(g)(1).
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-12. Rates for equipment and installation.
   (a)   In submitting its request for approval of current rates or for an
increase in rates for equipment and installation, the operator shall submit
information for all equipment that is used to receive the basic service tier,
regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive other
tiers of service, and shall otherwise comply with FCC regulations.
   (b)   The operator shall file its Form 1205 supporting its current rates or
a request for an increase in its rates at such times as comply with 47 U.S.C.
Sec. 76.923.
Sec. 4.5-13. Change in regulatory status.
   (a)   If the operator believes it is subject to effective competition as
defined in 47 C.F.R. § 76.905, it may petition the FCC for a change in its
regulatory status pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Sec. 907. At the time it initiates its
petition, the operator shall forward a copy of its petition to the city via
certified mail. The operator bears the burden of proving the existence of
effective competition.
   (b)   If the operator files a petition for a change in regulatory status,
the city shall within fifteen (15) days provide public notice of the filing of
the petition.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-14. Rates subject to refunds.
   If the city chooses to toll the period to review current rates, the current
rates will remain in effect subject to refund. In like manner, if the city
chooses to toll the period to review a proposed rate increase, it may permit
the proposed rate increase to go into effect subject to refund if ordered by
the city. If the city has taken no action at the end of the additional ninety
(90) days for the quarterly filing system or one hundred and fifty (150) days
for the cost-of-service system, the proposed rate increase shall go into effect
subject to refund. In all cases, the city shall issue a brief written executive
order in accordance with 47 C.F.R. § 76.933, that the operator keep an accurate
account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose
behalf such amounts were paid. Refunds shall be paid to the full extent allowed
by law.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-15. Certification of compliance.
   Within ninety (90) days of any order of the city mandating a reduction in
rates, ordering a refund of rates, or prescribing rates at a level less than
the rate increase sought by the operator, the operator shall file with the city
a certification, signed by an authorized representative, that it has fully
complied with the city's order and describing in detail the steps taken to
implement the order and showing how refunds, including interest, were
calculated and distributed.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-16. Public notice.
   Prior to taking any action to approve or disapprove rates, or prior to the
expiration of any period under this chapter that would result in rates going
into effect subject to refund, the city shall provide appropriate notice to the
public and an opportunity at a public hearing or otherwise at which interested
parties may orally express their views or submit written comments.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-17. Proprietary information.
   (a)   The operator may request that portions of the filings and information
it supplies to the city in support of its current rates or a proposed rate
increase be kept confidential. Such request may be made solely as it relates to
proprietary information. "Proprietary information" for purposes of this section
is information which if openly disclosed would permit an unfair commercial
advantage to competitors of the cable operator. If an operator wants any
information to be kept confidential, it shall stamp or mark each document as
"Proprietary and Confidential." If possible, the portions of the filing that
are proprietary shall be segregated from the nonproprietary information. The
request that the information be kept confidential must state the reason that
the information would permit an unfair commercial advantage to competitors of
the cable operator. The burden of demonstrating that the information requested
is proprietary shall fall on the operator.
   (b)   The Mayor or his designee shall grant the request that the information
be kept confidential if he determines that the preponderance of evidence shows
disclosure would permit an unfair commercial advantage to competitors of the
cable operator. If the operator requests confidentiality and the request is
denied, the operator may withdraw its request for a rate increase and the
information it claims to be proprietary will be returned to it.
   (c)   If the cable operator makes no request for confidentiality, the
material will be considered public records available for inspection by any
person pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-18. Decision.
   (a)   After it completes its review of the rate filing submitted by the
operator, the city shall issue an order approving or disapproving the current
rates sought to be justified or the increased rates sought. If the city had
previously decided pursuant to Sec.
4.5-10 or
4.5-11 to allow rates to remain in effect or go into effect subject to refund,
and if the city disapproves the rates in question, it shall issue an
appropriate order directing that refunds be made. The city may order such
refunds to the full extent permitted by the FCC regulations.
   (b)   The city may order a reduction in rates where necessary to bring rates
into compliance with FCC regulations. If the city determines that the current
rate or a proposed rate is unreasonable, it may prescribe a reasonable rate.
   (c)   Before disapproving a rate or prescribing a rate, or ordering a
refund, the city shall ensure that the operator has had notice and opportunity
to comment on the rate in question or refund. The city shall provide ten (10)
days written notice and give the operator the opportunity to submit written or
oral comments in addition to its rate filing.
   (d)   If the rates are disapproved in whole or in part, or the city
prescribes rates, or orders refunds, the order issued by the city shall specify
the reasons for the decision. The city clerk shall provide written notice to
the operator of the city's decision by providing a copy of the resolution or
order.
   (e)   The city's decision approving or disapproving the rate in whole or in
part, or prescribing rates, may be appealed to the FCC by the operator or by
any citizen who submitted oral or written comment to the city prior to the
order rendering the decision.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-19. Compliance with FCC regulations.
   This chapter is intended to comply with FCC regulations to the extent
required by federal law. If any section of this chapter becomes invalid or
inapplicable because of changes in federal law or FCC regulations, then the
cable operator shall comply with federal law or FCC regulations to the extent
required, and the remaining sections of this chapter shall remain in full force
and effect.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-20. Enforcement.
   The operator is required to comply with the terms and provisions of this
chapter and any order rendered pursuant to it. If the operator violates the
chapter or fails to comply with any order of the city with respect to rates, it
shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500) a day for each day it
is in violation or fails to comply. Violations of this chapter or failure to
comply with any order with respect to rates may be considered a violation of
the Franchise Agreement, if any, between the operator and the city.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)
Sec. 4.5-21. Effective date.
   This chapter shall take effect upon its passage and approval and publication
as required by KRS Chapter 424.
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-8-02)

arising from the same transaction(s) or occurrence(s) upon which the person
seeks relief hereunder. Upon receiving notice of the other charge or complaint,
the Human Rights Commission shall have discretion to dismiss the complaint
filed hereunder. The failure to provide such notice in a timely manner may
result in the immediate dismissal of the complaint filed herein. The complaint

with another agency or that any complaint concerning this matter filed with
another agency has been dismissed by such agency without final judgment on the
merits.

investigation settlement or is such settlement attempt is unsuccessful, then
the city manager shall conduct an investigation to determine whether there is
probable cause to believe the allegations of the complaint. An investigation

made whole to the greatest extent practicable.
      (8)   The city manager shall furnish a copy of such signed conciliation
agreement to the complainant and the person charged.

the complaint to attempt to eliminate the alleged violation by conciliation
agreement. In the event that either the complainant or the person or entity
charged indicates an unwillingness to participate in the conciliation process

been reached with the time provided, the city manager shall refer the complaint
for an administrative hearing. The city manager may continue attempts to reach
a conciliation agreement after referral of the complaint for hearing.

the hearing. The hearing officer shall receive only relevant and material
evidence and all evidence must be presented in the presence of the hearing
officer.
      (6)   Findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence in the
record. The strict rules of evidence governing civil proceedings shall not
apply; however, the hearing officer will abide by the general principles of
evidence in an effort to conduct a rational and reasonable investigation to
seek the truth of the matter. All findings of fact shall be based upon a
preponderance of the evidence. The order of proof shall be that set forth in
the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure. The hearing officer shall have the
discretion to grant a continuance or continue a hearing in progress on a
showing of good cause.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
§ 6-1. Fire protection service for industrial and commercial properties located
outside the city limits.
   (a)   The board of commissioners determines it to be in the best interest of
the economy of the City of Danville and its citizens that industrial and
commercial buildings located within Boyle County, but outside the limits of the
city, be protected against loss by fire, and a policy is hereby established
under which the city will provide fire protection service unto industrial and
commercial properties located outside the limits of the city, but within Boyle
County.
   (b)   Any owner of industrial or commercial property located within Boyle
County, but outside the limits of the City of Danville, desiring fire
protection service shall file an application with the office of the city
manager and pay unto the city an annual fee in advance for the providing of
such services in accordance with the formula or schedule attached hereto and
incorporated by reference. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the
city manager. The formula or schedule of fees may be amended from time to time
by resolution of the board of commissioners.
   (c)   If any industrial or commercial property to which the services are
provided is annexed into the City of Danville, then upon such annexation it
shall no longer be required to pay for its fire protection. Any payment for
service which has been made in advance shall be prorated and a proportionate
amount refunded unto the owner.
   (d)   The providing by the city of fire protection services shall not be
interpreted or construed so as to make the city an insurer or guarantor, and
under no circumstances shall the city be held liable unto the industrial or
commercial owner or occupant for any loss or damage from fire. The city shall
have complete discretion in determining priority in responding to fire calls,
which will be done in accordance with the applicable standard operating
procedures of the city.
   (e)   Any industrial or commercial owner or entity which procures fire
protection services pursuant to this section shall do subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations set forth herein.

   (a)   Applicability. The provisions of this section are applicable to all
open burning within the limits of the city.
   (b)   Definitions. "Open burning" means the burning of any matter in such a
manner that the products of combustion resulting from the burning are emitted
directly into the outdoor atmosphere without passing through a stack or
chimney.
      "Fire Prevention Code" refers to the Kentucky Standards of Safety adopted
by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1990, or any subsequent additions or
amendments thereof.
   (c)   Prohibition of open burning.
      (1)   No person shall cause, suffer, or allow any open burning except as

heating purposes, providing excessive or unusual smoke is not created;
         d.   Fires set for the purpose of bona fide instruction and training
of public and industrial employees in the methods of fighting fires;

economically feasible means of disposal is available and practical.
      (2)    Any person who causes, suffers, or allows any open burning
pursuant to the exceptions set forth in paragraphs (a) - (f) above unless said
fire is in an agricultural-residential (AR-1) zone, as defined by the zoning

      (3)   Where such a permit has been submitted and approved, the applicant
shall make provisions to have the burn site attended and monitored at all
times, and to have adequate hoses or other reliable sources of water delivery
available for extinguishment of the fire and for protection of nearby
exposures.
      (4)   As per the Fire Protection Code, the code official shall prohibit
open burning which will be offensive or objectionable due to smoke or odor
emissions when atmospheric conditions or local circumstances make such fires
hazardous. The code official shall order the extinguishment, by the permit
holder or by the division of fire, of any open burning which creates or adds to
a hazardous or objectionable situation.
   (d)   Penalty.
      (1)   Any person violating any provision of this section shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred
dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding sixty (60) days, or

violation shall constitute a separate offense.
      (2)   In addition to the penalties provided for in paragraph (1) any
condition which constitutes a violation of this section may be abated by the
city, and the costs of such abatement may be charged against the offender.

§§ 6.5-1 - 6.5-20. Reserved.
ARTICLE II. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 6.5-21. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives.
   (a)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky has in KRS 100 delegated to local government units the authority to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Commission of Danville, Kentucky,
hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows:
   (b)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of Danville are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by
the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
   (c)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (d)   Objectives. The objectives of this article are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
      (7)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.

§ 6.5-22. Definitions.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this article its most reasonable application.
   A zone means portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   Accessory use means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the
principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.

percent (1%) annual chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs)
are determined.
   AH zone means an area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between
one (1) and three (3) feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are
shown.

100-year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete
these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding
sources.
   A99 zone means that part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which
is to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system
under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.

flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   B and X zones (shaded) means areas of the two-tenths percent (0.2%) annual
chance (500-year) flood, areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than one (1) foot or with contributing drainage area less than

given year.
   Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four (4) sides.
   Building means a walled and roofed structure that is principally above

floodplain.
   Community means a political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   Community flood hazard area (CFHA) means an area that has been determined by
the floodplain administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,

important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood; and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   D zone means an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,

a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   Existing construction means any structure for which the "start of
construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January
1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also
be referred to as "existing structures."
   Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the
effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by Danville
based on specific technical base flood elevation data which established the
area of special flood hazards.
   Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   Five-hundred (500) year flood means the flood that has a two-tenths percent
(0.2%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the
500-year flood have a moderate to low risk of flooding.
   Flood, flooding, or flood water means:
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See "mudslides."
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See flood-
related erosion.
   Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) means a map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) means a map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e., mud flow), and flood-related erosion areas having
special hazards have been designated as zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means a map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   Flood Insurance Study (FIS) means the report provided by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
containing flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), and/or the
Flood Boundary Floodway Map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
   Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being
inundated by flood waters from any source.
   Floodplain administrator means the individual appointed by a NFIP
participating community to administer and enforce the floodplain management
ordinances.
   Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
ordinances, and open space plans.
   Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation
facilities, structures, and their contents.
   Floodproofing certificate means a certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.
Also referred to as the "regulatory floodway."
   Floodway fringe means that area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   Fraud and victimization, as related in section
6.5-26, Appeals and variance procedures, means that the variance granted must
not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this
requirement, the City Commission will consider the fact that every newly
constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of
the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Structures that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of
the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may
incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
   Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   Functionally dependent use facility means a facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   Governing body means the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality
that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   Historic structure means any structure that is:
   (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
   (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary
of the Interior; or
   (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
      (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior; or
      (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   Increased cost of compliance (ICC) coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the cost to
elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building.
   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential buildings (this
category includes public or government buildings, such as schools, libraries,
and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KRS 151.250 - Plans for dams, levees, etc. to be approved and permit issued
by cabinet (Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet) means:
   (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and the plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to require
approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
   (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the state
shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
subsection (1) above.
   (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.
   Letter of Map Change (LOMC) is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to

LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property
is not located in a SFHA.
   (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) means a revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
   (3)   Letter of Map Revision – Fill (LOMR F) means a determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA.
   Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed
and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain,
control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   Levee system means a flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met:
   (1)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
   (2)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state
agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community
participating in the NFIP.
   Limited storage means an area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck
support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the
completion of construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for
aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include
natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a
structure's foundation system.
   Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this article.
   Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with
or without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required
utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar
transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle (see "recreational
vehicle").
   Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels)
of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   Map means the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   Map panel number means the four (4)-digit number on a flood map, followed by
a letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four (4) digits represent the map
panel. The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter "A" is not used by FEMA; the letter "B" is the first
revision.)
   Market value means the structure value, excluding the land (as agreed
between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent
certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual
cash value) or adjusted assessed values.
   Mean sea level (MSL) means the average height of the sea for all stages of
the tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is
used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain
as shown on a community's FIRM. For purposes of this article, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988.
   Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term
risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
costs of disaster response and recovery.
   Mudslide (i.e., mud flow) means describes a condition where there is a
river, flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result
of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of
water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.
A mudslide (i.e., mud flow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a
landslide is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the floodplain
administrator only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate
cause of damage that occurs.
   Mudslide (i.e., mud flow) area management means the operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area means an area with land surfaces and
slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate
indicate a potential for mudflow.
   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) means the federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929, means a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRMs. Refer
to FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   New construction means structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of Danville's floodplain management
regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of Danville's adopted floodplain management ordinances.
   Non-residential means structures that are not designed for human habitation,
including but not limited to: small business concerns, churches, schools, farm
structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses,
recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial
structures, warehouses, and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less
than six (6) months duration.
   North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988, means a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRMs and digitally referenced FIRMs
(DFIRMs). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   Obstruction includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment, levee,
dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit,
culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure,
vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any
watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   One-hundred year flood (100-year flood) (see "base flood") means the flood
that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter "A" is subject to
the 100-year flood. Over the life of a thirty (30)-year loan, there is a
twenty-six percent (26%) chance of experiencing such a flood with the SFHA.
   Participating community means a community that voluntarily elects to
participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management
regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.
   Pre-FIRM construction means construction or substantial improvement, which
started on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the
initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later.
   Post-FIRM construction means construction or substantial improvement that
started on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community or
after December 31, 1974, whichever is later.
   Probation means a means of formally notifying participating NFIP communities
of violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the
local floodplain management regulations. During periods of probation, each
insurance policy is subject to a fifty-dollar ($50.00) surcharge.
   Program deficiency means a defect in a community's floodplain management
regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation
of those floodplain management standards or of the standards of 44 CFR 60.3,
60.4, 60.5, and/or 60.6.
   Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to safety or
health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

   (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
   (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable to a light duty
truck; and
   (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   Regular program means the phase of a community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
(1) foot. See "base flood."
   Remedy a violation means the process by which a community brings a structure
or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management
regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impact of non-
compliance. Reduced impact may include protecting the structure or other
affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement
provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations,
or reducing state or federal financing exposure with regard to the structure or
other development.
   Repair means the reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing
structure.
   Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
(2) or more separate occasions during a ten (10)-year period where the value of
damages equals or exceeds an average of fifty percent (50%) of the current
value of the structure, beginning on the date when the damage first occurred,
or four (4) or more flood losses of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more
over the life of the structure, or three (3) or more flood losses over the life
of the structure that are equal to or greater than the current value of the
structure.
   Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, and the like.
   Section 1316 means that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968,

whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a one (1)-year period
in which the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
   (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
   (b)   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure;" or
   (c)   Any building that has been damaged from any source or is categorized
as repetitive loss.
   Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions
means repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or improvement of the streets,
utilities, and pads equaling or exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the value of
the streets, utilities, and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or

this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.
   Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which water flows at least periodically.
   Watershed means all the area within a geographic boundary from which water,
sediments, dissolved materials, and other transportable materials drain or are
carried by water to a common outlet, such as a point on a larger stream, lake,
or underlying aquifer.
   X zone means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a two-tenths percent (0.2%) probability
of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood) in any year. Unshaded X zones
(C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance
probability of flooding is less than two-tenths percent (0.2%).

(Ord. No. 1791, Art. 2, 6-29-11)
§ 6.5-23. General provisions.
   (a)   Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all
special flood hazard areas (SFHA), areas applicable to KRS 151.250 and, as
determined by the floodplain administrator or other delegated, designated, or
qualified community official as determined by the City Commission of Danville
from available technical studies, historical information, and other available
and reliable sources, areas within the jurisdiction of the City Commission of
Danville which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens
of Danville.
   (b)   Basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Boyle County, dated July 4, 2011,
with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), other supporting data
and any subsequent amendments thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of these regulations by Danville, and for those land
areas acquired by Danville through annexation. This FIS and attendant mapping
is the minimum area of applicability of this article and may be supplemented by
studies for other areas which allow implementation of this article and which
are recommended to the City Commission by the floodplain administrator and are
enacted by City Commission pursuant to statutes governing land use management
regulations. The FIS and/or FIRM are permanent records of Danville and are on
file and available for review by the public during regular business hours at
Danville City Hall.
   (c)   Establishment of development permit.
      (1)   A development permit shall be required in conformance with the
provision of this article prior to the commencement of any development
activities in the special flood hazard areas (SFHA). See section
6.5-24(b) for instructions and explanation.
      (2)   Application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the floodplain administrator.
   (d)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance
with the terms of this article and other applicable state regulations.
Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Commission from taking such
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
   (e)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this article and another ordinance, easement,
covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (f)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (g)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This article shall not create liability on the part
of the City Commission of Danville, any officer or employee, the Commonwealth
of Kentucky, the Federal Insurance Administration, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (h)   Enforcement, violation notice and penalties.
      (1)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this article including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
      (2)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the floodplain administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this article including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the floodplain administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this article and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this article or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
      (3)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the floodplain administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this article including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the floodplain administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this article or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven (7) days of the date the
citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven (7) days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
      (4)   Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this article or failure
to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special
exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who
violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined no less than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
or imprisoned for not more than sixty (60) days, or both, and in addition,
shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the floodplain administrator from taking such other lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. No. 1791, Art. 3, §§ A - H, 6-29-11)
§ 6.5-24. Administration.
   (a)   Designation of local administrator. The City Commission of Danville
hereby appoints the assistant city engineer to administer, implement, and
enforce the provisions of this article by granting or denying development
permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein referred to as the
floodplain administrator.
   (b)   Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be
obtained before any construction or other development begins within any special
flood hazard area established in section
6.5-23(b). Application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the floodplain administrator prior to any development activities,
and may include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn
to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area
in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials,
drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
      (1)   Application stage.
         a.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
         b.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
non-residential structure will be floodproofed;
         c.   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential floodproofed structure will meet
the floodproofing criteria in section
6.5-25(b)(2) and (d)(2); and
         d.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      (2)   Construction stage.
         a.   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
         b.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The floodplain administrator shall review the lowest floor and
floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make the corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
   (c)   Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator. The floodplain
administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed, authorized and directed to
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this article. The
floodplain administrator is further authorized to render interpretations of
this article, which are consistent with its spirit and purpose, by granting or
denying development permits in accordance with its provisions. The duties and
responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
      (1)   Permit review. Review all development permits to ensure that:
         a.   Permit requirements of this article have been satisfied;
         b.   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained:
review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;
         c.   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner; and
         d.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this article, "adversely
affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with section
6.5-23(b), the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer section
6.5-25. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Commission for
adoption.
      (3)   Notification of other agencies.
         a.   Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division of Water, and
any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse;
         b.   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and
         c.   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      (4)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
         a.   Certification required by section
6.5-25(b)(1) (lowest floor elevations) as shown on a completed and certified
elevation certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to
mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or
substantially improved structures, in accordance with section
6.5-24(b)(2);
         b.   Certification required by section
6.5-25(b)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown
on a completed and certified floodproofing certificate. Verify and record the
actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or
substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with
section
6.5-24(b)(2);
         c.   Certification required by section
6.5-25(b)(3) (elevated structures);
         d.   Certification of elevation required by section
6.5-25(e)(1) (subdivision standards);
         e.   Certification required by section
6.5-25(b)(5) (floodway encroach ments);
         f.   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is

as specified in section
6.5-23(h).
      (5)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         a.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
section
6.5-26(3)(b);
         b.   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with section 6.5-23(b), then the floodplain
administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in
order to administer the provisions of section
6.5-25;
         c.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
floodplain administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with section
6.5-25(b)(2), a floodproofing certificate;
         d.   All records pertaining to the provisions of this article shall be
maintained in the office of the floodplain administrator and shall be open for
public inspection.
      (6)   Right of entry.
         a.   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this article, or whenever the administrator has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any
condition or ordinance violation which makes such building, structure or
premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the administrator may enter such
building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or
perform any duty imposed upon the administrator by this article.
         b.   If such structure or premises are occupied, he or she shall first
present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure, or
premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the
owner or other persons having charge or control of such and request entry.
         c.   If entry is refused, the administrator shall have recourse to
every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
         d.   When the administrator shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or
occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building,
structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the administrator for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this article.
      (7)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this article shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the person
doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.
      (8)   Revocation of permits.
         a.   The administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued under
the provisions of this article, in case there has been any false statement or
misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or plans on which
the permit or approval was based.
         b.   The administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by the
administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this article.
      (9)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the floodplain
administrator's staff, charged with the enforcement of this article, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his duties, shall not
thereby render himself personally liable, and is hereby relieved from all
personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a
result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties. Any
suit brought against any officer, employee, or member because of such act
performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this article
shall be defended by the department of law until the final termination of the
proceedings.
      (10)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A floodplain
construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced construction
within one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days from the date of its issuance
by the floodplain administrator.
(Ord. No. 1791, Art. 4, §§ A - C, 6-29-11)
§ 6.5-25. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
   (a)   General construction standards. In all special flood hazard areas the
following provisions are required:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard
shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for
resisting wind forces.
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      (4)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (5)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding; and if
      (6)   Within zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (7)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
      (8)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (9)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (10)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this article,
shall meet the requirements of new construction as contained in this article.
      (11)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this article,
shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered, extended, or
replaced.
   (b)   Specific standards. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section
6.5-23(b), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork, elevated
no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with standards of section
6.5-25(b)(3).
         a.   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth
number is specified.
         b.   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The floodplain administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states as a part of the technical
requirements for a state floodplain permit: "The applicant shall provide cross
sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base Flood
Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross
sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations."
         c.   In all other zones, elevated one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor
including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection department to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
floodplain administrator.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with section
6.5-25(b)(1) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
         a.   Be floodproofed below an elevation one (1) foot above the level
of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
         c.   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base
flood elevation; or
         d.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall
be provided to the official as set forth in section
6.5-24(b)(1)c.
         e.   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in section
6.5-25(b)(4).
         f.   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, and shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
            1.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect; or
            2.   Have a minimum of two (2) openings with a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwater.
      (3)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements
of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
         a.   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
            1.   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area
of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or
higher than the exterior foundation grade); and
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
         b.   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
         c.   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
      (4)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
         a.   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels;
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; or
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of
a flood.
         All manufactured homes must:
            1.   Be elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1) foot
above the level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
         b.   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage
as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
         c.   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-
30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
article, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured
in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations, is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
      (5)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established
in section
6.5-23(b) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
         a.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided,
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge.
         b.   If this section
6.5-25(b)(5) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
and other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of section
6.5-25.
   (c)   Standards for streams without established base flood elevation
(unnumbered A zones) and/or floodways. Located within the special flood hazard
areas established in section
6.5-23(b), where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided
or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
      (2)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section
6.5-23(b).
   (d)   Standards for shallow flooding zones. Located within the special flood
hazard areas established in section
6.5-23(b) are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1 - 3'),
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall: have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall:
         a.   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
         b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one (1) foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in section
6.5-25(b)(2).
   (e)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood
hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
      (4)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available (zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data
for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five
(5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.
      (5)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed
structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base
flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
floodplain administrator.
   (f)   Standards for accessory structures in all zones beginning with the
letter "A." For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas
designated "A" the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Structure must be non-habitable;
      (2)   Must be anchored to resist flotation forces;
      (3)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one (1) foot above
grade; total openings are to be one (1) square inch per one (1) square foot of
floor area; at least two (2) openings required on opposite walls;
      (4)   Built of flood resistant materials below a level one (1) foot above
the base flood elevation;
      (5)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;
      (6)   Can only be used for storage or parking; and
      (7)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.
   (g)   Critical facilities. Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year
floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible
within the floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no
feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within
the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one (1) foot or more above the
level of the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing
measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by
or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of
the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the
extent possible.
(Ord. No. 1791, Art. 5, §§ A - G, 6-29-11)
§ 6.5-26.   Appeals and variance procedures.
   (1)   Nature of variances.
      (a)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the article are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (b)   It is the duty of the City Commission to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (2)   Designation of variance and appeal board. The Board of Commissioners
hereby establishes an appeal board consisting of the members of the Floodplain
Appeals Committee described in section
6.5-41.
   (3)   Duties of variance and appeals board.
      (a)   The appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this article and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this article.
      (b)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local circuit court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (4)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this article, and the:
      (a)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (b)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (c)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (d)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (e)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (f)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (g)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (h)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (i)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (j)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (k)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (5)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this article, the appeal board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this article.
      (a)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this article. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Commission need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Commission
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
      (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this article); and
         3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under "public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (e)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (f)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (g)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of section
6.5-26(4)(a) - (4)(k) are satisfied and that the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a
public nuisance.
   (6)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty- five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
      (b)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain
administrator in the office of the Danville Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (c)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (7)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (8)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

§§ 6.5-27 - 6.5-30.   Reserved.
ARTICLE III. FLOOD HAZARD AREAS AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Sec. 6.5-31. Purpose.
   It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas. The provisions of this article are intended to
restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion
or in flood heights or velocities; to require that uses vulnerable to floods,
including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage
at the time of initial construction; to control the alteration of natural
floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are
involved in the accommodation of flood waters; to control filling, grading,
dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
to prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. No. 1675, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-32. Objectives.
   The objectives of this article are to protect human life and health; to
minimize expenditure of public money or costly flood control projects; to
minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding, and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; to minimize
prolonged business interruptions; to minimize damage to public facilities and
utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines,
and streets and bridges located in floodplains; to help maintain a stable tax
base by providing the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a
manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and to ensure that potential home
buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Ord. No. 1675, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-33. Definitions.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage,
and to give this article its most reasonable application.
   Addition (to an existing building). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is considered new construction.
   Basement. That portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   Building. A walled and roofed building, including a manufactured home, which
is principally above ground. A building shall include any other man-made
facility, structure or infrastructure, including a gas or liquid storage tank.
   Development. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or permanent
storage of materials or equipment.
   Ecological Hazard District (EHD). That portion of the flood hazard area
subject to periodic flooding due to inundation of subterranean drainage
channels, and delineated by sinkholes and the following soil types in the Soil
Survey of Boyle and Mercer Counties, Kentucky, April 1983: Maury (MaC), Maury
(MaB), McAfee (MaD), McAfee (MaD), Fairmont(FaD), Fairmont (FaC), Caleast
(CaC), and Caleast (CaB).
   Elevated building. A building, without a basement, built to have the lowest
floor elevated above the ground level be means of solid foundation perimeter
walls, pilings, columns (posts and/or piers), shear walls or breakaway walls.
   Existing construction. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975.
Existing construction may also be referred to as an existing structure.
   Flood. A temporary rise in stream flow or stage that results in water
overtopping its bank and inundating areas adjacent to the channel.
   Flood profile. The elevation (usually above mean sea level) of the water
surface in a stream during flood discharges. The flood profile that exists
during a flood depends upon the flood discharge and stream characteristics.
Both the flood discharges of a given frequency and the stream characteristics
change with time, as the land use on upstream watersheds change, and as the
stream is changed due to vegetation, bridges, culverts, obstructions, and the
like. The flood profile can be used to determine the exact limits of the
floodplain.
   Floodplain. That land, adjacent to a stream, channel or body of water, which
has been or may be hereafter covered by flood water, during the regulatory
flood. Floodplain shall include those lands which are included in the Special
Flood Hazard Areas, and those lands that are determined to be included within
the post-development floodplain.
   Floodplain variance. A grant of relief from the requirements of this article
which permits construction or use in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
article because specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   Floodproofing. A combination of structural provisions, changes or
adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the
reduction or elimination of flood damages to properties, water and sanitary
facilities, structures, and contents of buildings in a flood hazard area.
   Functionally dependent use. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, facilities that are necessary for the loading
or unloading of cargo or passengers, and boat repair facilities; but does not
include any residential use or any long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   General Floodplain District (GFD). That portion of the flood hazard area

determined to contribute to the historic significance of a National Register
Historic District or an area that meets the requirement of a National Register
Historic District; is individually listed on the state inventory of historic
places.
   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure.  Lowest floor shall not include an unfinished or
flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage, in an area other than a basement area; provided that such
enclosure is built in compliance with the applicable design requirements of
this article.
   Lowest opening. The lowest opening into a structure, including doors and
windows sills, foundation vents, the top of window wells, crawl space
entrances, and the top landing of exterior stairways and other openings leading
to below grade spaces. Lowest opening shall not include access to an unfinished

building access or storage.
   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
built on a permanent chassis, and designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to required utilities. For the purposes of floodplain
management, this term also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other
similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred and eighty (180)
consecutive days. For flood insurance purposes, the term manufactured home does
not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles.
   New construction. Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of this article, including any
improvements to such structure.
   Obstruction. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel rectification, bridge, conduit, culvert,
building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure or matter in,
along, across or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood
hazard area which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of
water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such
water, or that is placed where the flow of water might carry the same
downstream to the damage of life or property.
   Person.  Any natural person, firm, partnership, association, corporation.
   Post-development floodplain. The portion of land adjacent to a stream which
is anticipated to be covered with water during the one hundred (100) year,

duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   Regulatory flood. A flood of a magnitude having a one percent (1%) chance of
occurring in any given year, and which, over a long period of time, can be
expected to be equaled or exceeded, on the average, once every one hundred
(100) years. The limits of the regulatory flood for a site shall be determined
by reference to the elevations shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency
Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or shall be the
post-development floodplain. Base flood shall be synonymous with regulatory
flood.
   Regulatory flood protection elevation. The elevation of the lowest floor or
the lowest opening of a structure which shall be two (2) feet or more above the
water-surface elevation of the regulatory flood.
   Special Flood Hazard Area. That land shown as the Special Flood Hazard Area
(Zone A), including the channel, floodway and floodplain of the base flood, as
shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate
Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, dated 1985 (and any revisions
thereto including through a Letter of Map Amendment or a Letter of Map
Revision) of the Federal Insurance Administration report (Such maps may
hereafter be referred to as “FEMA maps”).
   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within
one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the
first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a
manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings,
installation of piles, construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or sidewalks; nor
does it include excavation for a basement or footing, piers or foundations, or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of an accessory building.
   Stream. Any river, creek or channel having well-defined banks, in which
water flows for substantial periods of the year. Stream shall include all
perennial streams shown as solid blue line, and intermittent streams shown as
dashed blue line, on the U.S.G.S. 7.5-minute topographic maps. A channel that
is not shown as a dashed or solid blue line on a U.S.G.S. map shall be
considered a stream if it has a drainage area of at least one hundred (100)
acres.
   Substantial improvement. For a structure built prior to the enactment of
this article, any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure taking
place during a five (5) year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure either: (1)
before the initial improvement or repair is started; or (2) if the structure
has been damaged by any means and is being restored, before the damage
occurred. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a
historic structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places, a State
Inventory of Historic Places, or within a Historic Preservation Overlay (HP-O)
District.
   Vegetative buffer strip. An area adjoining the stream which shall be used to
protect the stream from inappropriate activities by allowing no grading,
filling, removal of vegetation, or other disturbance of the soil or ground
cover, or the construction of principal or accessory buildings.
   Watershed. The region or area which drains into a river, lake or stream. The
total area included within a watershed will vary, depending on the drainage
system being considered, but usually the total area above a given point on a
stream, channel or lake that contributes runoff water to the stream or lake at
that point is called a watershed.

(Ord. No. 1675, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-38. Applicable standards.
   Unless otherwise specified, the following standards are applicable in all
Special Flood Hazard Areas, all post-development floodplains, and all
Ecological Hazard Districts (EHD) and General Floodplain Districts (GFD).
   (a)   Prohibited uses. The following uses shall be prohibited Special Flood
Hazard Areas and in post-development floodplains, unless granted through a
special permit or as a floodplain variance.
      (1)   Excavating, grading or filling which disturbs the natural grade of
the floodplain.
      (2)   Principal or accessory buildings for residential, business, office
or industrial use.
   (b)   Permitted activities. The following uses having low obstructive effect
shall be permitted in the floodplain, to the extent that they are not
prohibited by any other ordinance or are not prohibited in the vegetative
buffer strip; and provided that they do not require grading, filling,
structures, storage of materials and equipment, or any other obstructive
features.
      (1)   Agricultural uses, such as general farming, pasture, grazing,
outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, viticulture, truck farming, forestry,
sod farming, or wild crop harvesting. Agricultural fences necessary for these
uses are permitted.
      (2)   Uses accessory to private and public recreational uses, such as
golf courses, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat-launching
ramps, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries,
shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting and fishing
areas, and hiking and horseback-riding trails, pedestrian trails and crossings.
      (3)   Uses accessory to residential uses, such as lawns, gardens, parking
areas, and play areas.
      (4)   Functionally dependent uses as defined herein.
   (c)   Lots or buildings in a Special Flood Hazard Area. Where a new
structure or substantial improvement of an existing structure is proposed on a
lot that includes a Special Flood Hazard Area, and no regulatory flood
protection elevation is shown on the final record plan or the site plan for the
lot, the lowest opening of the structure shall be at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as determined through reference to the Federal
Insurance Administration report. Where a new structure or substantial
improvement of an existing structure is proposed within a Special Flood Hazard
Area, and neither the final record plan, the site plan, nor the Flood Insurance
Study specify a regulatory flood elevation for the stream, a licensed
professional engineer shall determine the regulatory flood elevation, or the
applicant may request assistance from the Kentucky Division of Water. The
engineer may use the contour interpolation method, contained in the Stormwater
Manual, to determine the regulatory flood elevation, which shall be the basis
for establishing the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (d)   Lots with a regulatory flood protection elevation. Where a new
structure or substantial improvement of an existing structure is proposed on a
lot which has a regulatory flood protection elevation noted on the final record
plan, or on the site plan, of the property, the lowest floor and the lowest
opening of the structure shall be at or above the noted elevation.
   (e)   Utility standards. All utilities shall be designed and located to
minimize their potential for flooding during the regulatory flood. All new and
replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood water into the systems. New or replacement sanitary
sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood
waters into the systems, and discharges from the systems into flood waters. On-
site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding. Electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be
designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
   (f)   Additions to existing structures. Additions to structures that were
lawfully constructed on fill, or at an elevation which was permitted prior to
the adoption or amendment of this article, shall be permitted; provided:
      (1)   The addition does not constitute substantial improvement to the
structure;
      (2)   The addition does not require filling in the floodplain;
      (3)   The floor elevation of the addition is proposed to be at least at
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (g)   General standards for major subdivision plans and site plan proposals.
All stormwater facilities shall be designed and constructed, and all post-
development floodplains shall be calculated, in conformance with the
requirements of the Stormwater Manual. All major subdivision plans and site
plans shall, at a minimum, be subject to the following requirements.
      (1)   Preliminary subdivision and site plan requirements. In order to
protect the floodplain during infrastructure construction, a preliminary
subdivision plan and/or a site plan shall indicate the location of a vegetative
buffer strip. The vegetative buffer strip shall be twenty-five (25) feet,
measured horizontally from the centerline, on each side of intermittent
streams; and twenty-five (25) feet, measured horizontally from the edge of the
bank, on each side of perennial streams. The boundary of the vegetative buffer
strip may be located inside or outside the horizontal limits of the floodplain.
Within the vegetative buffer strip, there shall be no mowing, grading, filling,
trenching, soil compaction, removal of vegetation, or other disturbance of the
soil or ground cover (including parallel utilities), or the storage of
equipment or materials during the construction of the infrastructure. Sediment
ponds, and detention ponds along perennial streams, shall be prohibited within
the horizontal limits of the vegetative buffer strip.
      (2)   Floodplain analysis. For any property one (1) acre in size or
larger, containing or adjacent to a Special Flood Hazard Area as defined
herein, or adjoining a stream having minimum drainage area of one hundred (100)
acres or greater, a floodplain analysis shall be required, in conformance with
the Stormwater Manual, to determine the post-development floodplain. Such
analysis shall not be required for the subdivision of property in a residential
or agricultural zone for which no infrastructure improvements are proposed;
however the Planning Commission may require a floodplain analysis for such a
subdivision in locations of known flooding.
      (3)   Revision of the Special Flood Hazard Area. If the watershed study
determines that the proposed development will cause the post-development
floodplain to be at a higher elevation or outside the limits of the Special
Flood Hazard Area, the project engineer shall prepare and submit a Letter of
Map Revision in conformance with the Stormwater Manual. If the post-development
floodplain is a lower elevation or inside the limits of the Special Flood
Hazard Area, and the developer wishes to base the regulatory flood protection
elevations on the lower elevations or narrower limits, then the project
engineer shall prepare, submit and obtain approval of the Letter of Map
Revision prior to the issuance of building permits utilizing the lower
elevations.
      (4)   Final record plan and site plan requirements. Final record plans
and site plans that include or adjoin a Special Flood Hazard Area or a post-
development floodplain shall include and show the floodplain boundaries.
Regulatory flood elevations (in relation to mean sea level) shall be noted on
the plan.
         a.   Regulatory flood protection elevation. The final record plan
shall show the regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) for each lot that
includes or is adjacent to a floodplain, and the site plan shall show the RFPE
for each such building.
         b.   Minimum setback. All lots which contain or adjoin a floodplain
shall have a minimum building setback from the floodplain of ten (10) feet
depicted on the final record plan and on the site plan. This building setback
shall be measured horizontally from the edge of the floodplain and shall be
applicable to all principal and accessory buildings on the lot.
         c.   Vegetative buffer strip. In order to protect the stream from
inappropriate activities, there shall be a vegetative buffer strip of twenty-
five (25) feet, measured horizontally from the centerline, on each side of
intermittent streams, and twenty-five (25) feet, measured horizontally from the
edge of the bank, on each side of perennial streams. The vegetative buffer
strip may coincide with the setback required above. Within the vegetative
buffer strip, there shall be no mowing, grading, filling, removal of
vegetation, or other disturbance of the soil or ground cover; no construction
of principal or accessory buildings; and no construction of other facilities,
including but not limited to, swimming pools, tennis courts, fences, trails,
baseball fields, soccer fields, playground equipment, decks, gazebos, shelters,
or parking lots, whether temporary or permanent.
      (5)   Subdivision and site plan review standards. All subdivision and
site plans shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, and
shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage to it and to
other uses. The following public facilities shall be permitted in the
floodplain.
         a.   Temporary sediment ponds that will be converted to permanent
stormwater management ponds, provided they are located outside the horizontal
limits of the vegetative buffer strip.
         b.   Roadways and utilities that cross at angles within ten (10)
degrees of being perpendicular to the water or to the floodplain.
         c.   Sanitary sewers, which shall be constructed outside the
horizontal limits of the ten (10) year post-development floodplain, with
manhole covers set at an elevation one (1) foot above the elevation of the
regulatory flood.
         d.   Storm sewer pipe outlets where the outlet terminates at the edge
of the post-development floodplain.
(Ord. No. 1675, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-39. Special permit uses.
   (a)   General requirements. Special permit uses in the floodplain may be
permitted only where existing streets or utilities are at elevations which make
construction outside the horizontal limits of the floodplain impractical, or in
other special circumstances.
      (1)   Structures shall ordinarily be located outside the horizontal
limits of the flood plain and at least two (2) feet above the elevation of the
regulatory flood, but may be allowed, as a special permit use, to be elevated
or floodproofed to a point above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (2)   Such structures shall be limited to those that will not be subject
to substantial flood damage, and which will not substantially affect the
capacity of any stream or increase the regulatory flood elevation.
      (3)   All special permit uses shall be located outside the horizontal
limits of the vegetative buffer strip.
      (4)   A licensed professional engineer shall develop and/or review
structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall
certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the requirements herein.
      (5)   Such certification, including the specific elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) to which such structure is elevated or floodproofed, shall
be provided to the City Engineer as a part of the application for the special
permit.
   (b)   Manufactured homes. Any manufactured home permitted in any floodplain
as a special permit use shall be elevated so as to be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation, and anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top and frame ties to ground anchors. Federal
Emergency Management Agency Manual (FEMA #85), "Manufactured Home Installation
in Flood Hazard Areas," published in September 1985, shall be the basis for
determination of compliance with this section. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
   (c)   Floodproofed buildings. New construction or substantial improvement of
an existing structure for business, office, industrial or other non-residential
use, so as to be floodproofed, shall be permitted as a special permit use;
provided that below the regulatory flood protection elevation the structure is
watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
with the structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
   (d)   New structures on fill. New construction or substantial improvement of
an existing structure on fill shall be permitted as a special permit use,
provided the lowest floor and the lowest opening are at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. Such fill shall be at least one (1) foot above the
regulatory flood elevation for the particular area, and shall extend at that
same elevation towards the stream channel for a distance of at least fifteen
(15) feet beyond the limits of the structure thereon. However, no use shall be
constructed which adversely affects the capacity of streams or floodplains of
any main stream or tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other
drainage facility or system, or will increase the regulatory flood elevation.
   (e)   Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated buildings, which include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the base flood elevation, shall be designed to
preclude finished living space, and to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must be certified by a
licensed professional engineer, and shall meet the following minimum criteria:
      (1)   The structure shall have a minimum of two (2) openings having a
total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above grade;
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions;
      (4)   Electrical, plumbing and other utility connections are prohibited
below the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      (5)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) and the limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (6)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms.
   (f)   Temporary parking areas and parking structures. Temporary parking
areas and elevated parking structures shall be permitted in the floodplain as
special permit uses.
   (g)   Other uses. Uses such as tennis courts, for which fences are an
integral requirement, shall be permitted as a special permit use in the
floodplain. All fences must be designed and located to minimize obstruction of
the floodplain. Swimming pools shall not be permitted in the floodplain.
(Ord. No. 1675, 2-28-05)

      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
      (11)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
article.
   (f)   Conditions attached to all special permits. Upon consideration of the
factors listed above and for the purposes of this article, conditions may be
attached to the granting of special permits as are deemed necessary to further
the purposes of this article. Among such conditions, without limitation because
of specific enumeration, may be modification of waste-disposal and water-supply
facilities, limitations on periods of use and operation, imposition of
operational controls, sureties, deed restrictions, requirements for
construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees and other protective
measures, floodproofing measures which shall be designed consistent with the
regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, considering
flood velocities, durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces,
and other factors associated with the regulatory flood. The City Engineer shall
require the applicant to submit a plan or document certified by a licensed
professional engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the
regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the
particular area. The following floodproofing measures may be required, without
limitation because of specific enumeration.
      (1)   Structural anchorage, such as the addition of mass or weight to
structures, to resist flotation, or anchorage to resist flotation and lateral
movement.
      (2)   Waterproofing measures such as installation of watertight doors,
bulkheads and shutters, or similar methods of construction; use of paints,
membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of water through walls; construction of
water supply and waste treatment systems so as to prevent the entrance of flood
waters; installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm drains which
will permit the drains to be closed to prevent back-up of sewage and
stormwaters into the buildings or structures. Gravity draining of basements may
be eliminated by mechanical devices.
      (3)   Structural reinforced construction to resist rupture or collapse
caused by water pressure or floating debris.
      (4)   Water removal devices, such as the installation of pumps, to lower
water levels in structures, and the installation of pumping facilities or
comparable practices for subsurface drainage systems for buildings, to relieve
external foundation, wall and basement flood pressures.
      (5)   Location of hazardous equipment, including all electrical
equipment, circuits and installed electrical appliances, in a manner which will
assure they are not subject to flooding and to provide protection from
inundation by the regulatory flood. Any structural storage facilities for
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, or other toxic
materials, which could be could be hazardous to public health, safety and
welfare, shall be designed and constructed in a manner which will assure the
facilities are at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, or are
adequately floodproofed to prevent flotation of storage containers, or damage
to storage containers, which could result in the escape of toxic materials into
flood waters.
   (g)   City Engineer's review. The City Engineer shall be empowered to
approve, conditionally approve or deny any request for a special permit.
However, this power is not construed to give the City Engineer authority to
grant floodplain variances from the provisions of this article. Any request for
a floodplain variance shall follow the procedures below. Every effort shall be
made to complete the review and to render a decision within sixty (60) days of
the submission of a completed application. However, failure to complete the
review within the time period shall not constitute approval or denial of the
special permit. The City Engineer shall notify the Codes Enforcement Officer of
this decision, in writing, giving reasons for granting or denying the request,
and conditions of approval (if any) of the special permit.
   (h)   Special permits on publicly owned land. Any activity requiring a
special permit that is proposed to be constructed on land owned by the city or
the county shall be approved by the City Commission or the County Commission,
as appropriate, prior to issuance of the special permit.
   (i)   Kentucky Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water. The
Division of Water has authority to review all plans involving any obstructive
effect on the stream and floodplain in accordance with KRS 151. In any
situation where approval of the Division of Water is required, a copy of such
shall be submitted to the Codes Enforcement Officer as a part of the review
materials. If the Division of Water disapproves the request. no officer,
department or board of the city or county government shall have the authority
to approve the request.

(Ord. No. 1675, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-42. Floodplain variances.
   Under the terms of this article, an activity needing a floodplain variance
is defined as any proposed activity in a flood hazard area not considered as
either a permitted use or special permit use in this article. All requests for
floodplain variances shall follow the same procedures as outlined above for an
appeal of the City Engineer's decision, and shall first include review of the
request by the City Engineer. Further review of a floodplain variance request
shall be referred to the Floodplain Appeals Committee as established herein.
The following shall apply to floodplain variance requests.
   (a)   Floodplain variances may be issued for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation or restoration of historic structures, as defined herein;
provided that the Committee finds that the floodplain variance is the minimum
necessary so as to not destroy the historic character and design of the
building; and that such reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration will not
result in the structure losing its historical designation.
   (b)   In its review of floodplain variance applications, the Committee shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and all standards
specified in other sections of this article. In consideration of such factors
and the purposes of this article, the Committee may attach such conditions to
the granting of floodplain variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this article.
   (c)   Floodplain variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodplain if any increase in flood levels during the regulatory flood would
result.
   (d)   Floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the floodplain variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
   (e)   Floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant the floodplain variance
would result in exceptional hardship; a determination that the granting of a
floodplain variance will not result in extraordinary public expense, create
nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
   (f)   Any applicant to whom a floodplain variance is granted shall be given
written notice by the Codes Enforcement Officer of Planning, specifying the
difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the
structure is to be built, and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

or a General Floodplain District, and the site is not located in a Special
Flood Hazard Area or a post-development floodplain, and where detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic calculations have not been performed in conjunction
with the development, the Codes Enforcement Officer shall refer the request to
the City Engineer for review. In his or her review, the City Engineer may
require the elevation of the lowest floor and the lowest opening of the
structure to be not less than two (2) feet above the nearest regulatory flood
elevation for the stream (as shown on the FEMA Maps), or not less than two (2)
feet above any calculated or known high-water level that the City Engineer has
on file for the watershed; or may require the submission of information
prepared by a licensed professional engineer that the elevation is at least two
(2) feet above the elevation of the regulatory flood, and will not obstruct the
floodplain or create adverse flooding conditions on adjacent properties. In
addition, the Codes Enforcement Officer shall require the submission of a
foundation and footer detail prepared by the private professional engineer
prior to the issuance of the building permit. Appeals of the elevation
requirements of the City Engineering shall be referred to the Floodplain
Appeals Committee and shall follow the review procedure therein.

more of its value, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this article.
   (d)   Any alteration, addition or repair to any nonconforming structure
which would result in substantially increasing its flood-damage potential shall
be prohibited.
(Ord. No. 1675, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-46. Existing structures not nonconforming.
   Structures or uses which were lawfully constructed on fill, or elevated, so
as to be at least one (1) foot above the regulatory flood elevation, shall be
considered conforming uses.
(Ord. No. 1675, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-47. Enforcement.
   The provisions of special use permits shall be enforced by the Codes
Enforcement Officer and by the City Engineer. Generally, the City Engineer
shall determine compliance with elevation requirements and drainage features,
and the Building Inspector shall enforce structural requirements where
floodproofing of the structure is required. Minimum floor elevations shall be
enforced through an elevation certificate, prepared by a registered land
surveyor or a professional engineer, and submitted to the Codes Enforcement
Officer after the elevation of the lowest opening is established and before any
further work on the structure proceeds.
(Ord. No. 1675, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-48. Penalties.
   Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variance or special permits, shall constitute a

ARTICLE IV. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE
Sec. 6.5-51. Findings; authority.
   (a)   Findings.
      (1)   The city maintains a system of storm and surface water management
facilities including but not limited to, inlets, conduits, manholes, channels,
ditches, drainage easements, retention and detention basins, infiltration
facilities, and other components, as well as natural waterways.
      (2)   The stormwater system in the city requires regular maintenance and
improvements.
      (3)   Stormwater quality is degraded due to erosion and the discharge of
nutrients, metals, oil, grease, toxic materials, and other substances into and
through the stormwater system.
      (4)   The public health, safety, and welfare is adversely affected by
poor ambient water quality and flooding.
      (5)   All real property in the city either uses or benefits from the
maintenance of the stormwater system.
      (6)   The extent of use of the stormwater system by each property is
dependent on factors that influence runoff, including land use and the amount
of impervious areas of their property on the stormwater management system.
      (7)   The cost of improving, maintaining, operating and monitoring the
stormwater system shall be allocated, to the extent practicable, to all
property owners based on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of
their property on the stormwater management system.
      (8)   Management of the stormwater system to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare requires adequate revenues and it is in the interest of the
public to finance stormwater management adequately with a use fee system that
is reasonable and equitable so that each user of the system pays to the extent
to which they contribute to the need for it.
      (9)   The city is required to develop a stormwater quality program
through the NPDES Phase II stormwater program that is required by state and
federal law.

considered part of the stormwater collection system.
   Water means any stormwater, surface water, snow melt or groundwater.
(Ord. No. 1726, § 1, 12-13-07)
Sec. 6.5-53. Stormwater management fund—establishment; purpose.
   (a)   Establishment.
      (1)   The stormwater management program is established and the stormwater
system is provided to protect the waterways and land in the City of Danville by
managing flooding and to benefit the natural environment. The cost of
designing, developing, improving, operating, maintaining, and monitoring the
stormwater system required in the City of Danville should, therefore, be
allocated, to the extent practicable, to all property owners based on their
impact on the stormwater system. In order to provide revenue to fund those
costs and to fairly allocate those costs, a stormwater management fund (“the
fund”) is established.
      (2)   All revenues collected for the purpose of stormwater management
from user fees, grants, permit fees, and other charges collected under this
article, shall be deposited into the fund. The City Commission may make
additional appropriations to the fund. All disbursements from the fund shall be
for the purposes of the fund as set forth in this article.
   (b)   The fund shall be used for the following purposes:
      (1)   The acquisition by gift, purchase, or condemnation of real
property, and interests therein, necessary to construct, operate, and maintain
stormwater management facilities.
      (2)   All costs of administration and implementation of the stormwater
management program, including the establishment of reasonable operation and
capital reserves to meet unanticipated or emergency stormwater management
requirements.
      (3)   Engineering and design, debt service and related financing
expenses, construction costs for new facilities, and enlargement or improvement
of existing facilities.
      (4)   Operation and maintenance of the stormwater system.
      (5)   Monitoring, surveillance, and inspection of stormwater control
devices.
      (6)   Water quality monitoring and water quality programs.
      (7)   Retrofitting developed areas for pollution control.
      (8)   Inspection and enforcement activities.
      (9)   Costs of public education related to stormwater and related issues.
      (10)   Billing and administrative costs.
      (11)   Other activities which are reasonably required.
(Ord. No. 1726, § 1, 12-13-07)
Sec. 6.5-54. Stormwater management fee.
   A monthly service fee is imposed upon all real property in the City of
Danville, beginning no earlier than January 1, 2008, to fund stormwater
management programs. This service fee shall be known as the stormwater
management fee (“fee”). Any real property developed or added through annexation
into the City of Danville after January 1, 2008, shall be subject to a monthly
service fee. The fee is based on (1) the extent to which runoff from each
property creates the need for the stormwater management program; (2) the amount
of impervious area on each property; and (3) the cost of implementing a
stormwater management program.
(Ord. No. 1726, § 1, 12-13-07)
Sec. 6.5-55. Classification of property for determination of stormwater
management fee.
   For purposes of determining the stormwater management fee, all properties in
the City of Danville are classified into one of the following classes:
   (a)   Single family residential (SFR) property. The Commission finds that
the contribution to runoff of most parcels of real property in the City of
Danville classified as single family residential is similar and that it would
be excessively and unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square
footage of the improvements (such as building, structures, and other impervious
areas) on each parcel. Therefore, all single family residential properties in
the city shall be charged a flat stormwater management fee, equal to the base
rate, as provided in section
6.5-56.
   (b)   Non-single family residential (non-SFR) property. The fee for non-SFR
property in the City of Danville shall be the base rate multiplied by the
numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area (square feet)
of the property by the ERU. The impervious surface area for non-SFR property is
the square footage for the buildings and other improvements on the property. At
the sole discretion of the City Commission, the impervious surface area of non-
SFR property may be approximated through site examination, mapping information,
aerial photographs, and other available information. The minimum stormwater
management fee for non-SFR property shall equal the base rate for single family
residential property.
   (c)   Non-developed property. The fee for non-developed property in the City
of Danville shall be a flat stormwater management fee, equal to the base rate,
as provided in section
6.5-56.
(Ord. No. 1726, § 1, 12-13-07)
Sec. 6.5-56. Rates.
   (a)   Base rate. A monthly base rate for the stormwater management fee is
established for all single family residential property per ERU.
   (b)   Schedule of monthly rates for stormwater management fee. The following
schedule of rates shall apply to each property owner. This schedule includes
the rate for the stormwater fees.
 
RATE CATEGORY                 RATE PER MONTH
Single family residential     $3.36
                              $3.36, multiplied by the numerical factor
Non-single family residential obtained by dividing the total impervious area
                              (square feet) of the property by one (1)
                              equivalent
 
(Ord. No. 1726, § 1, 12-13-07; Ord. 1759, § 2, 10-12-09)
Sec. 6.5-57. Fee for tax-exempt properties; exemptions.
   (a)   The City Commission finds that all real property in the City of
Danville contributes to runoff and either uses or benefits from the maintenance
of the stormwater system. Therefore, all real property in the city, including
property that is tax exempt from property tax by the Kentucky Revised Statutes,
as amended, shall be subject to the fee.
   (b)   Property which is owned by the City of Danville shall be subject to
the fee.
   (c)   All federal, state, county, and city roads are exempt from the fee and
are considered to be part of the City of Danville drainage systems.
(Ord. No. 1726, § 1, 12-13-07)
Sec. 6.5-58. Assessment notices.
   (a)   The City Commission may, but is not required to, send assessment
notices for the fee to property owners prior to the billing for the fee.
   (b)   If assessment notices are sent, the notice shall include the following
information:
      (1)   The classification of the property for purposes of determining the
fee;
      (2)   For property classified as other developed property:
         a.   The impervious surface area of the property; and
         b.   The method by which the impervious surface area of the property
was determined; that is whether the computation of the impervious surface area
of the property is based on information in the Boyle County Property Valuation
Office, site examination, mapping information, aerial photographs, or other
methods.
      (3)   The amount of the base rate (i.e., the single family residential
fee), and for other developed property, the number of base units on the
property.
(Ord. No. 1726, § 1, 12-13-07)
Sec. 6.5-59. When payable; penalties; lien on rental property; abatement of
small amounts due.
   (a)   The fee shall be billed on the water bill on the same cycle and
frequency as the water bill for the property. The City Commission shall
determine the most effective method of billing. Billings for any particular
billing cycle shall be made by the due date shown on the bill. Any payment not
received by the delinquency date as shown on the water bill shall be considered
delinquent and the city may disconnect and terminate water service to the
premises subject to Danville Code of Ordinance, Chapter 18.
   (b)   If a bill is rendered to a party who is not the property owner and the
bill becomes unpaid and/or delinquent, then the property owner shall bear the
responsibility of payment.
   (c)   A delinquent fee that is not paid by the delinquency date shown on the
bill will incur a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the bill.
   (d)   The fee, including the penalty of ten percent (10%) of the total bill,
when overdue shall constitute a lien on real property and may be collected by a
suit against the property owner or in an in rem action against the property.
   (e)   The City Commission may abate the fee, including penalties, if the
cost of collection is reasonably estimated to exceed the amount of the fee,
including penalties, due and payable.
(Ord. No. 1726, § 1, 12-13-07)
Sec. 6.5-60. Request for correction of stormwater management fee.
   (a)   A property owner may request correction of the fee by submitting the
request in writing to the City Engineer’s Office within thirty (30) days after
the date the assessment notice or the bill is mailed or issued to the property
owner. Grounds for correction of the fee include:
      (1)   Incorrect classification of the property for purposes of
determining the fee;
      (2)   Errors in the square footage of the impervious surface area of the
property;
      (3)   Mathematical errors in calculating the fee to be applied to the
property; and
      (4)   Errors in the identification of the property owner of a property
subject to the fee.
   (b)   The City Engineer’s Office shall make a determination within sixty
(60) days after receipt of the property owner’s completed written request for
correction of the fee. The City Commission decision on a request for correction
of the fee shall be final.
   (c)   A property owner must comply with all rules and procedures adopted by
the City Commission when submitting a request for correction of the fee and
must provide all information necessary for the City Engineer’s Office to make a
determination on a request for correction of the fee. If a property owner
alleges an error under division (a)(2) above, the request for correction must
include a certification by a registered engineer or professional land surveyor
of the impervious surface area of the property. Failure to comply with the
provisions of this division (c) shall be grounds for denial of the request.
(Ord. No. 1726, § 1, 12-13-07)
ARTICLE V. EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
Sec. 6.5-61. Intent. 
   The intent of this article is to protect property, prevent damage to the
environment, and promote the public welfare in the city, by guiding,
regulating, reviewing comments, and controlling the design, construction and
use of excavation, grading and other similar activities which disturb or break
the topsoil, or result in the movement of soil. During construction, soils are
the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. This eroded soil endangers
water resources by reducing water quality, and causing the siltation of aquatic
habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates the
repair and cleaning of storm sewers, ditches and other facilities in the
stormwater system. The regulations contained in this article are intended to
prevent soil erosion, and to provide procedures for submission, review and
approval of erosion control plans prior to soil disturbance.
(Ord. No. 1674, 2-28-05; Ord. No. 1991, § 1, 4-25-22)

Sec. 6.5-66. Best management practices.
   Erosion and sediment control plans shall utilize the following best
management practices, and shall conform to the provisions of the Stormwater
Manual, to minimize erosion and control sedimentation. Any best management
practices may be selected provided that they are, at a minimum, as protective
as Kentucky’s General Permit for Stormwater Construction Sites (KYR10).
   (a)   Nonstructural best management practices. The following nonstructural
practices shall be incorporated into all erosion and sediment control plans.
      (1)   Avoidance of the floodplain.
         a.   Temporary sediment control in a permanent pond shall be allowed
in the post-development floodplain, but not in the stream.
         b.   Roadways and utilities may only cross the floodplain at angles
within ten (10) degrees of perpendicular to the water.
         c.   In order to protect floodplains, streams and watercourses during
grading, stripping, excavating, filling or other disturbance of the natural
ground cover, a vegetative buffer strip of twenty-five (25) feet, measured
horizontally from the edge of the stream bank, shall be provided on each side
of the stream, or in absence of clear stream banks, twenty-five (25) feet,
measured horizontally from the centerline of the stream. Within the vegetative
buffer strip, there shall be no grading, filling, removal of vegetation, or
other disturbance of the natural ground cover or natural features. The buffer
shall be expanded to 50 feet in areas where the receiving waters have been
designated as Coldwater Aquatic Habitat or Outstanding State Resource Water,
categorized as an Outstanding National Resource Water or Exceptional Water, or
has been listed in the most recently approved Integrated Water Quality 305(b)
Report to Congress as an Impaired Water (sediment impaired) for which an
approved TMDL has not been developed for pollutants of concern that may be
discharged from the facility in accordance with the KYR10 permit.
      (2)   Construction of on-site measures prior to soil disturbance.  All
on-site measures required by the erosion and sediment control plan shall be
made functional prior to commencing soil disturbance on the site. Clearing,
except as is necessary to establish such on-site measures, shall not begin
until all on-site measures have been installed.
      (3)   Reduced exposure time. Permanent and temporary soil stabilization,
as provided in the Stormwater Manual, shall be applied to all disturbed areas
within fourteen (14) days after final grade is reached. Soil stabilization also
shall be applied to all disturbed areas not at final grade which have been
inactive for fourteen (14) days.
      (4)   Control waste. Construction site operators shall control waste such
as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and
sanitary waste at the construction site that may cause adverse impacts to water
quality.
   (b)   Structural best management practices for soil stabilization. The
following best management practices shall be used to achieve soil
stabilization.
      (1)   Slope stabilization. To minimize the adverse effects of steep
embankment slopes, constructed fill slopes and cut slopes shall not be steeper
than three (3) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical. For slopes of four (4)
feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical or steeper, with slope lengths of
greater than one hundred (100) feet, temporary diversion ditches shall be
constructed at the top of the slope and every one hundred (100) feet
horizontally down the slope.
      (2)   Mulch. Mulch shall be used as soil stabilization for any disturbed
area inactive for fourteen (14) days or longer. Areas requiring stabilization
during December through February shall receive only mulch held in place with
bituminous material. Mulch shall be used whenever permanent or temporary
seeding is used.
      (3)   Temporary seeding. Temporary seeding shall be used for soil
stabilization when grades are not ready for permanent seeding, except during
December through February. Only rye grain or annual rye grass seed shall be
used for temporary seeding.
      (4)   Permanent seeding. Permanent seeding shall be applied within
fourteen (14) days after final grade has been reached, except during December
through February. Permanent seeding shall be applied on any areas that will not
be disturbed again for a year, even if final grades have not been reached.
      (5)   Sod. Sod shall be used for disturbed areas that require immediate
vegetative cover as specified in the Stormwater Manual. Sod may be installed
throughout the year.
      (6)   Construction entrance. A stabilized construction entrance, as
provided in the Stormwater Manual, shall be constructed wherever vehicles are
leaving a construction site to enter a public road, or at any unpaved entrance/
exit location. The construction entrance shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet
long, and shall be an on-site measure to be constructed prior to commencing
further construction.
      (7)   Road and parking stabilization. Gravel or paving material, as
provided in the Stormwater Manual, shall be used to stabilize permanent roads
and parking areas, as well as temporary roads and parking areas used repeatedly
by construction traffic. Stabilization shall be accomplished within fourteen
(14) days of grading or beginning use for construction traffic.
      (8)   Dust control. Dust control, as provided in the Stormwater Manual,
shall be provided in conjunction with all grading, stripping, excavating,
filling or other disturbance of the natural ground cover, and in areas with
frequent construction traffic.
      (9)   Geotextiles. Mulch netting, erosion control matting, or turf
reinforcement matting shall be used on sloping areas, and may be used in other
areas as specified in the Stormwater Manual.
      (10)   Gabion mattresses. Gabion mattresses shall be used at the outlets
of all culverts and storm drains with an exit velocity greater than five (5)
feet per second when flowing full, except where paved ditches are used. Gabion
mattresses shall also be used at the outlet of impact stilling basins.
      (11)   Temporary diversion ditches. Temporary diversion ditches shall be
used to collect sediment-laden runoff from disturbed areas, and to direct it to
a sediment pond, where applicable. Because temporary diversion ditches are
expected to be used for less than one (1) year, no stabilization is required.
      (12)   Level spreaders. Level spreaders shall be constructed at the
outlets of temporary diversion ditches, and at the outlets of permanent
constructed waterways where they terminate on undisturbed areas.
      (13)   Permanent vegetated waterways. Permanent constructed waterways
shall be used to divert stormwater runoff from upland undisturbed areas, around
or away from areas to be disturbed during construction. Constructed waterways
that are expected to be in place for at least one (1) year shall be considered
permanent. Permanent waterways shall be lined with sod, nets or mats, or have
permanent seeding as provided in the Stormwater Manual.
      (14)   Pipe slope drains. Whenever it is necessary to convey water down a
slope which is not stabilized or which is prone to erosion, pipe slope drains
shall be used, unless a paved ditch is used.
      (15)   Impact still basins. Impact stilling basins shall be used at the
outlet of culverts and storm sewers with calculated exit velocities greater an
fifteen (15) feet per second when flowing full.
   (c)   Structural best management practices for sediment control. The
following best management practices shall be used to achieve sediment control.
      (1)   Check dams. Check dams shall be constructed, as provided in the
Stormwater Manual, prior to the establishment of vegetation in newly
constructed, unpaved, open channels which are used to drain ten (10) acres or
less.
      (2)   Sediment traps.  Sediment traps shall be installed, as provided in
the Stormwater Manual, below all disturbed areas of less than five (5) acres
which do not drain into a sediment pond.
      (3)   Sediment ponds. Sediment ponds shall be installed, as provided in
the Stormwater Manual, below all disturbed areas of five (5) acres or more. The
maximum area for a single pond shall be one hundred (100) acres. The pond shall
be designed to reduce peak discharges during construction to the pre-
development level for the one hundred (100) year, one (1) hour storm.
      (4)   Silt fences. Silt fences shall be installed, as provided in the
Stormwater Manual, down-slope of areas to be disturbed prior to clearing,
grading, stripping, excavating, filling or other disturbance of the natural
ground cover. The silt fence must be located such that the total area draining
to the fence is not greater than one-fourth (1/4) acre per one hundred (100)
feet of fence. Silt fences shall be used for storm drain drop-inlet protection
and around soil stockpiles.
      (5)   Storm drain inlet protection. Storm drain inlet protection shall
only be used around drop-inlets when the up-slope areas draining to the inlet
has no other sediment control.
      (6)   Filter strips. Filter strips, as provided in the Stormwater Manual,
shall be used on each side of streams, wetlands, sinkholes and permanent
constructed waterways.
      (7)   Stream-crossing structures. Stream-crossing structures shall be
used at locations where construction traffic, permanent traffic or utilities
must cross a stream.
      (8)   Pump-around flow diversions. Pump-around flow diversions shall be
used to divert flow-around construction activities occurring in a stream, when
those activities are reasonably expected to cause the erosion or deposit of
sediment in a stream.

Sec. 6.5-67. Requirements for low density residential projects.
   (a)   Construction of, or an addition to, a residential structure of four
(4) units or less, including an accessory structure for such a residential
structure, shall not require the submission of a separate erosion and sediment
control plan as a condition to the issuance of a building permit.
   (b)   However, the following shall be required during construction.
      (1)   Installation of a silt fence or other sediment control. In order to
prevent sediment from washing into streets, catch basins, storm sewers, grassed
open channels and adjacent properties, sediment controls shall be installed.
Such controls shall include silt fences, diversion ditches, earthen berms,
grass strips at least twenty-five (25) feet wide, or other controls as
specified in the Stormwater Manual. Disturbed areas that drain directly to a
sediment pond or a sediment trap by means of a temporary diversion ditch do not
require additional sediment controls.
      (2)   Seeding and mulching. All disturbed areas shall be seeded and
mulched within fourteen (14) days after final grading of the property and in
areas not to grade which will be inactive for more than fourteen (14) days.
      (3)   Temporary gravel pad. A temporary gravel pad, thirty (30) feet
wide, shall be installed from the edge of the street at least twenty (20) feet
into the property, to provide a temporary construction entrance.

permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection. An illicit connection shall include, but not be limited to, the
connection of a line conveying sewage to the storm drainage system, or allowing
such a connection to continue.
(Ord. No. 1676, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-82. Suspension of access to the storm drainage system.
   (a)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The City
Engineer may, without prior notice, suspend discharge access to the storm
drainage system to a person, when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the storm drainage system or the waters of Danville. If the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the City
Engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage
to the storm drainage system or the waters of Danville, or to minimize danger
to persons.
   (b)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the storm drainage system in violation of this article may have
their access terminated, if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The City Engineer shall notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its storm drainage system access. A person commits an offense if
the person reinstates access to premises terminated pursuant to this section,
without the prior written approval of the City Engineer.
(Ord. No. 1676, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-83. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with such permit may be required, in a form acceptable to
the City Engineer, prior to allowing discharges to the storm drainage system.
(Ord. No. 1676, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-84. Monitoring of discharges.
   (a)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   (b)   Access to facilities. The City Engineer shall be permitted to enter
and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article, as often as
may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to the City Engineer.
      (1)   Facility operators shall allow the City Engineer ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as
defined by state and federal law.
      (2)   The City Engineer shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary, in the opinion of the City Engineer, to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
      (3)   The City Engineer has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator, at the written or oral request of the City Engineer, and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City Engineer access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense, if
the person denies the City Engineer reasonable access to the permitted facility
for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
article.
      (6)   If the City Engineer has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample, as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article, or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the City Engineer may seek issuance of a search
warrant.
(Ord. No. 1676, 2-28-05)
Sec 6.5-85. Best management practices.
   The City Engineer shall adopt requirements identifying best management
practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drainage
system, or the waters of Danville. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the storm drainage system or watercourses, through the use of these
structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at such person's expense, additional structural
and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
storm drainage system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid
NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
NPDES permit.
(Ord. No. 1676, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-86. Protection of the waters of Danville.
   Every person owning property through which the water of Danville passes
shall keep and maintain that part of such water within the property free of
trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other material that could pollute or
contaminate water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner shall
maintain the property adjacent to the water free of such trash, debris,
excessive vegetation, and other materials that could pollute or contaminate the
watercourse during periods of flooding.
(Ord. No. 1676, 2-28-05)
Sec. 6.5-87. Notification of spills.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials, which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage system, or the
waters of Danville, such person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, such person shall immediately notify the
Director of Emergency Management Services, the Chief of the Fire Department,
and the City Engineer. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials,
such person shall notify the persons listed above by phone, in person, or by
facsimile, no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice, addressed and mailed to the above
listed persons, within three (3) business days of the phone or personal notice.
If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner and/or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge, and the actions taken
to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
(3) years.
(Ord. No. 1676, 2-28-05)

sidewalk and may not be located closer than ten (10) feet to the property line
unless placed on an existing impervious driveway. It shall be the obligation of
the property owner to secure the units in a manner that does not endanger the
safety of persons or property in the vicinity. The owner or user of the
portable moving and storage unit may apply to the codes enforcement officer for
an extension of time, not to exceed an additional one (1) week for placement of
the unit and the codes enforcement officer, upon showing of good cause, shall
grant the requested extension. Any extension shall be in writing. The keeping
or maintaining of a portable storage structure as set out herein shall
constitute permitted temporary outdoor storage. The keeping or maintenance of
such structure except as set out in this definition shall not constitute
permitted temporary outdoor storage and shall be deemed a public nuisance for
all purposes of this chapter.
   Temporary outdoor storage shall include portable moving and storage units,
as limited and defined above, and shall also mean the limited exterior storage
for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from date of placement on property
(or any adjoining or adjacent parcel) of raw materials, lumber and/or building
supplies essential for the addition, renovation, or restoration of a one (1) or
two (2) family dwelling or its premises. This includes structural, sheathing,
or decorative materials, trim materials, other housing components including
fixtures, and landscaping materials including uninstalled fencing materials,
uninstalled pools and ancillary equipment, bulk landscaping materials, and
components for detached buildings. The codes enforcement officer shall have the
authority, upon written application by the property owner prior to the
extension of the initial sixty (60) day penalty stating with particularity the
reason an extension is needed and stating further the expected date of removal
of materials stored outdoors, to extend the permitted outdoor storage time
limit by two (2) separate additional thirty (30) days. All temporary outdoor
storage shall be confined to the rear or side yard of the residence and no
front yard storage shall be permitted. All such materials shall be covered or
tarped during periods when no work is being performed, including nights and
weekends. Temporary outdoor storage shall not include scrap piles, waste piles,
brush piles, or similar materials covered adequately in other areas of this
article. Renovation and demolition debris are considered as refuse and trash
under this article. Storage of raw materials in front yard of a residence shall
be considered a public nuisance under this chapter. Storage of raw materials,
lumber, building equipment or materials in excess of the time limit shall not
be deemed temporary and shall be considered a public nuisance under this
chapter. For all purposes under this article, including the right of entry and
enforcement, the terms “nuisance item” or “nuisance items” shall be deemed to
include non-compliant portable moving and storage units, raw materials, lumber
and/or building supplies stored in the front yard or stored for a period
exceeding the time limitations as set out in this section.

§ 8-26. Notice.
   (a)   Whenever the code enforcement officer deems a public nuisance to exist
pursuant to section
8-23, he shall issue a notice to the parties hereinafter stated, and such
notice shall:
      (1)   Be in writing.
      (2)   Specify the public nuisance and its location.
      (3)   Request the public nuisance to be abated.
      (4)   Advise such party that he has ten (10) days to abate the nuisance
or to make a written demand for a hearing before the code enforcement officer,
or else the public nuisance will be removed and abated by the city.
   (b)   The notice shall be sent by registered mail, return receipt requested,
to the last known address of the owner of the property whereon the nuisance is
located, as it appears on the current tax assessment roll. Where the owner of
the property is not the occupant thereof, such notice shall be mailed also to
the occupant. The code enforcement officer shall coordinate his efforts to
determine ownership of a junked motor vehicle or mobile home with the police
department, and notice shall also be sent to the last registered and legal
owner of record of the junked motor vehicle or mobile home, unless the owner or
occupant of the premises whereon the nuisance is located, and unless
identification numbers are not available to determine ownership of the vehicle
or mobile home. If the owner, or his address, of any junked motor vehicle or
mobile home is not known or cannot be readily ascertained, the notice to him to
abate, and of his right to a hearing, may be given by attaching such notice to
the vehicle or mobile home, no less than ten (10) days before action is taken.
If the latter method ofservice is used, the code enforcement officer shall make
an affidavit attesting to such facts. Where a junked motor vehicle or mobile
home is found to be upon any public property within the city, notice to the
owner of the vehicle or mobile home is all that shall be required. Where a
junked appliance or other item declared to be nuisance under this article is
found on public property, no notice shall be required.
(Code 1977, § 65.020(5)(a), (b); Ord. No. 1692, § 4, 11-28-05)
§ 8-27. Hearing.
   If a hearing following receipt of a notice as provided for in section
8-26 is demanded, the hearing shall be held within five (5) days after the
demand is made and shall be conducted by the code enforcement officer, who
shall hear all the facts and testimony on the condition of the junked motor
vehicle, appliance or other item of nuisance, and the circumstances concerning
its location. Such hearing shall not be limited by the technical rules of
evidence. The code enforcement officer may impose such conditions and take such
other action as he deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the
purpose of this article. He may delay the time for removal of the junked motor
vehicle, appliance or other item of nuisance, if, in his opinion, circumstances
justify it. At the conclusion of any hearing, the code enforcement officer may
find that a nuisance item, junked motor vehicle or appliance has been
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or is inoperative on private or public property,
and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and order
disposal of same. The order requiring removal shall include a description of
the nuisance item, junked appliance or junked motor vehicle, and the correct
identification number and state license tag number of the junked motor vehicle
or mobile home, if available at the site.

§ 8-28. Appeals.
   Any interested party may appeal the decision of the code enforcement
officer, by appealing to any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the
rules of civil procedure, within fourteen (14) days after the decision. If no
appeal is taken within the time prescribed, or immediately after a final
judicial review affirming the right to remove the nuisance, the code
enforcement officer shall cause the junked motor vehicle, appliance or other
nuisance item to be removed and disposed of in any manner as he may provide.

pursuant to this article by any owner-occupant or owner of private property who
has been notified and ordered to abate such public nuisance within the times as
set forth in section
8-26, the code enforcement officer is hereby authorized, empowered and directed
to remove same and dispose of it.
   (b)   The cost of such removal and disposal shall be accounted for by the
code enforcement officer, and where the full amount due the city for such
service is not paid by such owner within thirty (30) days after the disposal of
such nuisance, then and in that case, the code enforcement officer shall cause
to be recorded in the county court clerk's office a sworn statement showing the
cost and expenses incurred for the work, the date the work was done, and the
location of the property on which such work was done. The recordation of such
sworn statement shall constitute a lien and privilege on the property, and
shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal and
interest, plus cost of court, if any, for collection, until final payment has
been made. Sworn statements recorded in accordance with the provisions of this
article shall be prima facie evidence that all legal formalities have been
complied with, and shall be full notice to every person concerned that the
amount of the statement, plus interest, constitutes a charge against the
property designated or described in the statement, and that the same is due and
collectible as provided by law.

from the premises prior to the time for removal by the city shall be considered
in compliance with the provisions of this article, and no further action shall
be taken against the owner of the junked motor vehicle, appliance or other
nuisance item, or against the owner or occupant of the premises. Written
permission given to the enforcement officer for the removal of the junked motor
vehicle, appliance or other nuisance item by the owner of same or the owner or
occupants of the premises on which it is located, shall be considered
compliance with the provisions of this article on their part, and no further
action shall be taken against the ones giving such permission, except for
collection of towing charges or hauling costs for the removal of the nuisance.

§ 9-7 Smoking in public places and places of employment.
   (a)   (1)   Findings; intent. The Board of Commissioners of the city finds
that:
         a.   According to numerous studies, tobacco smoke is a major
contributor to indoor air pollution. Breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of
disease in healthy non-smokers. These diseases include heart disease, stroke,
respiratory disease and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined
in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to
65,000 Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI)).
         b.   The Public Health Service’s National Toxicology Program (NTP) has
listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health
Information Service (EHIS)).
         c.   Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to the elderly,
individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airways
disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma,
respiratory infections, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), developmental
abnormalities and cancer. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal
EPA)).
         d.   The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple

   (d)   Mobile food unit vendors shall only use lighting which is affixed to
the mobile food unit and which does not cause any glare that creates a public
hazard, nuisance or distraction to other vehicles or neighboring businesses. No
flashing, strobe or neon lighting shall be permitted.
   (e)   Mobile food unit vendors shall supply their own electrical power and
shall not connect to city power outlets.
   (f)   Mobile food unit vendors shall be equipped with at least one 2A-40 BC
fire extinguisher; if fryers are used a 2A-40 BC, class K fire extinguisher;

officers shall be authorized to inspect the permitted mobile food unit without
notice and without consent during normal operating hours.
   (l)   Consent for mobile food units to operate on any city property other
than an approved location shall be obtained from the City Manager or his or her
designee prior to operating on such city property. The city may impose
conditions for the approval of such requests as it deems necessary for health
and safety and to mitigate the impact of vending that conflicts with city
operations. The city has the authority to limit or prohibit such operation on
other city properties.
   (m)   Mobile food unit vendors shall not sell or serve alcoholic beverages
except under the applicable state and local license.
   (n)   The city may grant relief from the above provisions pursuant to an

public.
      (2)   If the Codes Enforcement Department exercises the right to suspend
or revoke a permit issued under this chapter, written notice shall be provided
to the vendor at the address on file for the permit. Delay or failure to issue
a suspension or revocation of any permit shall not constitute a waiver of this
section. No reimbursement for any portion of the permit fee shall be made in
the event a permit is suspended or revoked, or if a mobile food unit is
required to relocate temporarily or permanently.
   (c)   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Codes Enforcement Department

a sum as set from time to time by order of the board of commissioners, to
ensure the proper restoration of the ground and laying of the pavement. Where
the amount of the deposit is clearly inadequate to cover the cost of relaying
the surface of the ground or pavement, the city engineer may increase the
amount of the deposit to an amount considered by him to be adequate to cover
the cost. From this deposit shall be deducted the expense to the city of
relaying the surface of the ground or pavement and of making the refill if this

be by himself, his subcontractor, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by
him. Such insurance shall cover collapse, explosive hazards, and underground
work by equipment on the street, and shall include protection against liability
arising from completed operations. The amount of the insurance shall be
prescribed by the city engineer in accordance with the nature of the risk
involved; provided, that the minimum liability insurance shall be set from time
to time by order of the board of commissioners.

this time limitation unless permission for an extension of time is granted by
the city engineer.

cannot be found, it shall be the duty of his agent in charge of the property
upon receipt of such notice, to make the repairs as required in this section,
and if there be no such agent, it shall be the duty of the occupant of the
property, upon receipt of such notice, to make such repairs as are required in

according to specifications.
(Code 1977, § 11.540(5))
§ 14-76. Abatement by city and imposition of lien against property.
   Upon the failure of the owner of the property to comply with section
14-71 and/or section
14-73, the city may effect or cause to be effected the repair of such defect in
the sidewalk, and the same shall be done at the expense of the owner of the
property. The city shall have a lien against the property for the reasonable
value of labor and materials used in the making of such repairs. The affidavit
of the building inspector shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount
of the lien and the regularity of the proceedings pursuant to this section, and
shall be recorded in the office of the Boyle County Clerk. The lien shall be
notice to all persons from the time of its recording and shall bear interest at
six (6%) percent per annum thereafter until paid. The city shall have the
option of enforcing collection of such expenses against the responsible person
either by filing of an appropriate civil action or by enforcement of the lien.

§ 14-107. Police protection.
   (a)   The Chief of Police shall determine whether and to what extent
additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the parade or public
assembly for traffic control and public safety. The Chief of Police shall base
this decision on the size, location, duration, time and date of the event, the

the event. If additional police protection for the public assembly is deemed

from a consideration of the application and from such other information as may
otherwise be obtained, he finds that:
      (1)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not substantially
interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other pedestrian or vehicular
traffic contiguous to its route or location;
      (2)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not require the
diversion of so great a number of city police officers to police properly the
line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police
protection of the city;
      (3)   The concentration of person, animals, and vehicles at public
assembly points of the parade or public assembly will not unduly interfere with
property, fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas
contiguous to such public assembly areas;
      (4)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly is not reasonably
likely to cause injury to persons or property;
      (5)   The parade or public assembly is scheduled to move from its point
of origin to its point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable
delays en route;

in the parade;

and location is already granted or has been received and will be granted;
      (11)   No parade or public assembly permit application for the same time
but not location is already granted or has been received and will be granted,
and the police resources required for that prior parade or public assembly are
so great that in combination with the subsequent proposed application, the
resulting deployment of police services would have an immediate and adverse
effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property; and
      (12)   No event is scheduled elsewhere in the city where the police
resources required for that event are so great that the deployment of police
services for the proposed parade or public assembly would have an immediate and
adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property.
      (13)   The parade, if it takes the form of cruising, has the approval in
writing of the owner or an authorized agent of the owner for the use of the
parking lot which is the site of the parade.
   (b)   No permit shall be granted that allows for the erection or placement
of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a city street, sidewalk,
or right-of-way unless advance approval for the erection or placement of the
structure is obtained from the Board of Commissioners.
(Ord. No. 1574, 6-27-00)
§ 14-109. Non-Discrimination.
   The Chief of Police shall uniformly consider each application upon its
merits and shall not discriminate in granting or denying permits under this

related grounds.

after notice of the action of the Chief of Police, file a written notice or

requirements of, and shall have the effect of, a parade or public assembly
permit issued under this article.

location, but shall be required to pay a special event permit fee of twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) per booth/stall/space leased, rented or otherwise
provided, and such permit shall be valid for a period not to exceed five (5)

unless within twenty (20) days following the conclusion date of the event, the
permittee requests and applies for a reconciliation of the actual permit fee
due to the city, in which case the amount of additional fees or the amount of
refund due shall be determined and paid. The city shall also have the right to
request a reconciliation from the permittee within twenty (20) days following
the conclusion date of the event to verify the number of booths/stalls/spaces
leased, rented or otherwise provided in order to confirm that the correct
number of permits were paid for and whether additional permit fees need to be
collected or refunded.
         c.   This required special event permit fee shall not be required of
any person, firm, or business entity already possessing or otherwise required

sole purpose of religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, civic
or fraternal purposes, where no part of the earnings, incomes or receipts of
such unit, group or association, inures to the benefit of any private
shareholder or other person.

15; Ord. 1882, § 1, 5-23-16; Ord. 1894, § 1, - -)
Sec. 16-19. Apportionment.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, profit shall be
apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in subsection (b) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in subsection (c) of this section,
and the denominator of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
subsection (c) of this section.
      (3)   For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the business entity
shall file an apportionment form provided by the Occupational Tax Office.
   (b)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (c)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         a.   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city, regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         b.   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
or other place of storage in the city, and the purchaser is the United States
government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property, or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city, and
the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-
producing activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (d)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will
fairly represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (e)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by anemployee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records to establish apportionment. For
the purposes of this subsection, the employer or employee, as specified in
section
16-20 of this article, shall file a payroll apportionment form as supplied by
the Occupational Tax Office.
(Ord. No. 1687, 9-26-05)
Sec. 16-20. Employers to withhold.
   (a)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee shall
deduct and withhold, upon the payment of the compensation, any tax imposed
against the compensation by the city. Amounts withheld shall be paid to the
city in accordance with section
16-18 of this article.
   (b)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter ending
thereafter, on or before the end of the month following the close of each
quarter, make a return and report to the city, and pay to the city the tax
required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or
required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the city.
   (c)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any sums
required by this article to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to be
withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (d)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (e)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually, on or before February 28 of each year, complete and file, on a
form furnished or approved by the city, a reconciliation of the occupational
license tax withheld where compensation is paid or payable to employees. Either
copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax statements, or
a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the city, shall be submitted.
   (f)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement, on or before
January 31 of each year, showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the
employee, for payment to the city during the preceding calendar year.
   (g)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (h)   The president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this section shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one (1) or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
subsection unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for,
or pay over the tax imposed by this article at the time that the taxes imposed
by this article become or became due.
   (i)   Not withstanding subsections (g) and (h) of this section, every
employee receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under
section
16-18 of this article shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all
cases where the employer does not withhold the tax levied under this article
from the employee, such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing
with the city each quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer. If
an employer fails or is not required to withhold, report orpay the license fee,
it shall become the duty of the employee to file with the city. The only
employer not required to withhold, report and pay the occupational license tax
is the federal government, including the United States Postal Service. The
payment required to be made by an employee can be made quarterly, for the
periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year,
or at any time the employee wishes to make an estimated payment for the year in
which wages are earned. All license fees must be received by February 28 for
the preceding calendar year, together with a copy of the employee's W-2 form.
Employers not required to withhold, report or pay the license fee must
annually, during the month of January of each year, make a return to the
Occupational Tax Administrator, in which is set forth the name and Social
Security Number of each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar
year, giving the amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation
earned during such preceding year by each such employee. This list shall
include all current full-time employees, part-time employees, temporary
employees, and terminated employees, whether such termination was voluntary or
involuntary.
(Ord. No. 1687, 9-26-05)
Sec. 16-21. Returns required.
   (a)   All business entity returns for the preceding taxable year shall be
made by April 15 of each year, except returns made on the basis of a fiscal
year, which shall be made by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
the close of the fiscal year. Blank forms for returns shall be supplied by the
city or its designated agent.

shall be upon the local government to establish that a violation occurred. If
the court finds that a violation occurred, the owner shall be ordered to pay to
the City of Danville all fines, fees and penalties occurring as of the date of
the judgment. If the court finds that a violation did not occur, the City of
Danville shall be ordered to dismiss the citation and the plaintiff shall be
authorized to recover all costs.

upon the streets or thoroughfares within the city or parked, stopped or
standing upon a street or public way within its jurisdiction in violation of
any ordinance or statute prohibiting parking, stopping or standing in the
location, manner or at the time the vehicle is cited or for any other lawful
reason, including but not limited to the arrest of the operator of the vehicle.
   (b)   All violators shall be subject to the schedule of fines levied for
parking and traffic offenses. Violators shall pay all reasonable towing and
handling charges, not to exceed thirty-five dollars ($35.00), and all
reasonable storage charges, not to exceed five dollars ($5.00) per day or
portion thereof.
   (c)   Impounded vehicles shall be released only upon advance payment of the
towing, handling and storage charges imposed thereon, unless the owner or other
person entitled to possession challenges the validity of the impoundment
pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. A vehicle may be released to the
owner or other person entitled to possession only upon proof of ownership or
right to possession. The City of Danville, any Danville police officer, or any
other party in custody of the impounded motor vehicle may in their discretion
require reasonable security, bond or other assurances of indemnification from a
person who is not the registered owner of the vehicle prior to releasing the
vehicle to such person.
   (d)   The owner of a motor vehicle impounded pursuant to this section or
other person entitled to possession may challenge the validity of such
impoundment by requesting in writing a hearing before the hearing board. The
hearing shall be conducted within ten (10) business days of the date of the
request, unless the owner or other person entitled to possession waives the
limitation or the hearing board shows good cause for such delay. The City of
Danville shall retain possession of the vehicle pending the hearing, unless the
owner or other person claiming the right of possession posts a bond in the
amount equal to the fine and fees accrued as of the date of the hearing
request, or seventy-five dollars ($75.00) whichever is less. If the owner or
person claiming possession of the vehicle is unable to pay the amount of the
bond, the hearing shall be held within seventy-two (72) hours of the date the
request for hearing is received, unless such person requests or agrees to a
continuance.
   (e)   (1)   No less than five (5) days prior to the date set for hearing,
the person requesting the hearing shall be notified of the date, time and place
of the hearing. In the case of a hearing required to be held within seventy-two
(72) hours of the date of the request as provided in sub-section (d) of this
section, the person requesting the hearing shall be informed at the time of
request or as soon thereafter as is practicable of the date and time of the
hearing.
      (2)   Any person who refuses or, except for good cause, fails to appear
at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have conceded on
behalf of that individual and on the owner's behalf the validity of the
impoundment.
      (3)   At the hearing, after consideration of the evidence, the hearing
board shall determine whether the impoundment was valid and reasonable. If the
impoundment is found unjustified, an order releasing the vehicle shall be
entered. All fines and fees paid or amounts posted as bond because of the
impoundment of the vehicle shall be returned. If the impoundment was justified,
the hearing board shall uphold the impoundment and condition the release of the
vehicle upon payment of all accrued fines and fees. If bond has been posted as
security for release of the vehicle, said bond shall be forfeited to the City
of Danville. Any fines or fees in excess of the amount of the bond posted shall
be ordered to be paid by the owner of the vehicle to the City of Danville. The
board shall furnish the owner or person appearing on the owner's behalf with a
copy of its order.
      (4)   The hearing board may consider a parking citation and any other
written report made under oath by the issuing officer in lieu of the officer's
personal appearance at the hearing.
      (5)   An appeal from the hearing board's determination may be made to the
Boyle District Court within seven (7) days of the hearing board's
determination. The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a
copy of the hearing board's order in the same manner as any civil action. The
action shall be tried de novo and the burden shall be on the City of Danville
to establish that impoundment was justified. If the court finds that the
impoundment was justified, the owner shall be ordered to pay all fees and fines
accruing as of the date of judgment. If the court finds the impoundment
unjustified, the City of Danville shall be ordered to release the vehicle, if
applicable, and to return all fines and fees paid as a result of the
impoundment and the plaintiff shall be authorized to recover all costs.
      (6)   The judgment of the Boyle District Court may be appealed to the
Boyle Circuit Court in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.

§ 17-195. Issuance and sale of revenue bonds.
   (a)   The city may provide funds for carrying out of the purposes hereunder
by the issuance and sale of revenue bonds. The city may, from the proceeds for
the bonds, reimburse its general fund for any expenditures for such purposes
made by it before sales and delivery of the bonds. The bonds shall not
constitute an indebtedness of the city but shall be secured by such revenues as
the PAD board of commissioners provides by and through ordinances enacted by
the city commission. The PAD board of commissioners may pledge all or any part
of any one (1) or more of the following:
      (1)   The revenues derived from the property acquired or constructed from
the proceeds of such bonds.
      (2)   Any revenues of any other similar project, whether acquired from
the proceeds of similar bonds or otherwise.
      (3)   Any revenues derived by the city from street parking meters.
   (b)   The bonds shall be designated on their face "Public Off-Street Parking
Facilities Revenue Bonds." It shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond
that it does not constitute an indebtedness of the city within the meaning of
any constitutional provisions or limitations, or at all. The bonds shall be
authorized by ordinance of the PAD board of commissioners. The bonds shall be
dated, shall bear interest at rates not exceeding six and one-half percent (6
1/2%) per annum, shall be in the denominations, shall be payable at the place,
which may be at any bank within or without the commonwealth, shall mature at
the time not exceeding forty (40) years from their date, and may be made
redeemable before maturity, at the option of the city, at prices and under the
terms and conditions, and shall be executed in the form and manner, all as
fixed by the PAD board of commissioners prior to the issuance of the bonds. The
PAD board of commissioners shall determine the form of the bonds, including any
interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the
bonds. In case any officer whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons
ceases to be such officer before the delivery of the bonds, such signatures
shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he
had remained in office upon delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupons in
registered form, or both, as the PAD board of commissioners may determine, and
provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal
alone and also to both principal and interest and for the reconversion of any
bond registered as to both principal and interest into coupon bonds. Such bonds
shall be exempt from taxation by the commonwealth and by the city and any
political subdivision of the commonwealth or the city to the extent permitted
by law. Such bonds may be issued without a vote of voters and without any other
proceedings or happenings or any other conditions or things than those
proceedings, conditions and things which are specified and required by Kentucky
Revised Statutes.
   (c)   The PAD board of commissioners may authorize the sale of the bonds in
the manner and for the price it determines to be for the best interest of the
city, but no sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of
interest on the money received therefor at more than six and one-half percent
(6 1/2%) per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the
bonds and in accordance with standard tables of bond values. If the proceeds of
the bonds by error or calculation or otherwise are less than the cost of the
facilities for which the bonds are authorized, additional bonds may in like
manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficit unless otherwise provided
in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds; shall be deemed to be
of the same issue; and shall be entitled to payment from the same funds without
preference or priority of the bonds first issued. The ordinance authorizing the
bonds may make such other conditions and provisions therefor, including
provisions for the issuing of additional bonds and prescribing the relative
priority thereof as the PAD board of commissioners deems desirable. Bonds
issued pursuant to the Kentucky Revised Statutes shall have and are hereby
declared to have, in the hands of a bona fide holder, all of the qualities of a
negotiable instrument under the Uniform Commercial Code.
(Ord. No. 1445, § 5, 6-27-91)
§ 17-196. PAD board of commissioners to fix rates for use of facilities.
   (a)   The PAD board of commissioners shall fix and revise from time to time
fees, rates, rentals and charges for the use of the facilities constructed or
acquired hereunder; and such fees, rates, rentals and charges shall be so fixed
and adjusted as to provide such funds as the PAD board of commissioners deems
appropriate; but in no event shall the funds be less than sufficient to pay the
costs of maintaining, repairing or operating the facilities, and paying the
interest on and the principal of the revenue bonds issued hereunder for the
construction or acquisition of such facilities and to create necessary reserves
for the foregoing purposes. Upon the payment of all of the bonds issued for any
project, the revenue from such project in excess of costs of maintenance and
operations may be used for general municipal purposes as determined by the city
commission.
   (b)   The rates or fees to be charged by the PAD shall be fixed at the
lowest possible rates consistent with the achieving of the purposes of this
article, which shall, together with any additional income, defray the cost of
maintaining, operating and administering the parking facilities and of meeting
the charges for principal and interest on any indebtedness incurred under this
article, including reserves for such purposes and a margin of safety.
(Ord. No. 1445, § 6, 6-27-91)

§ 17.5-2. Planting; permit.
   Any person may plant a tree within the public right-of-way immediately
adjacent to his property upon obtaining a permit from the office of the city
engineer.

integrity or appearance of an area's tree population. Further, where such
action would promote the public welfare, the office of the city engineer may
condition the granting of a permit upon the applicant's agreement to plant only
a certain species of tree.
   The office of the city engineer may deny a permit although all conditions
have been met, but only for just cause based on circumstances unique to the
property affected which would create a threat to public welfare and/or safety
if the proposed planting were permitted.

fourteen (14) days after an application is filed. Failure to issue such
decision within said time period shall have the same effect as approval of the

DIVISION 2. EXTENSION OF WATER AND SANITARY SEWER SERVICE
§ 18-31. Policy.
   (a)   In order to promote the orderly growth and advancement of existing and
proposed residential, commercial and industrial areas inside, and outside, the
city limits; adjacent to, and surrounding the city, so that such areas may at
the proper time be served by the water and/or sewer service and those areas
outside the city limits be orderly annexed to the city, the board of
commissioners of the city hereby decrees that henceforth city water or sanitary
sewer service will not be extended to any of the aforesaid such areas,
including those within the city limits, except under the terms and conditions
set forth in this chapter.
   (b)   This policy is based on the plan adopted many years ago by the mayor
and board of commissioners for the financing of the municipally owned water and
sanitary systems, which plan provides generally:
      (1)   For all local water distributions mains, including valves, fire
hydrants, fire hydrant gate valves, and service connections, and all local
collector sewers, including manholes and service connections, to be paid for by
the subdivider, developer, or property owner.
      (2)   Operation and maintenance expenses are to be paid for from service
charges.
(Code 1977, § 11.080; Ord. No. 1289, § 1, 5-12-81; Ord. No. 1317, § 1(1), 6-28-

§ 18-32. Applications - Required.
   The subdivider, developer or property owner requesting an extension of city
water and/or sewer service shall file an application as provided in section 2.1
of the Standard Construction Specifications, rules and regulations as adopted
in section
18-17.
(Code 1977, § 11.080; Ord. No. 1289, § 1, 5-12-81; Ord. No. 1317, § 1(2), 6-28-
83)
§ 18-33. Same - General rules of priority for consideration.
   (a)   Applications for extension of city water and/or sewer services will be
considered in accordance with the following order of priorities.
      (1)   The area requesting service is located within existing city
boundaries.
      (2)   The area requesting service is adjacent or contiguous to the
existing city boundary.
      (3)   The area requesting service is located within the city's growth
management area (City of Danville Growth Management Report, Appendix H, Plan
#1).
      (4)   The area requesting service is located adjacent or contiguous to an
existing city water and/or sewer service line.
      (5)   All other requests for services.
   (b)   The provisions in subsection (a) apply to all such applications;
however, the board of commissioners may, by resolution or order, grant a waiver
of any or all of these provisions when it is deemed to be in the best interest
of the city to do so.
(Code 1977, § 11.080; Ord. No. 1289, § 1, 5-12-81; Ord. No. 1317, S 1(3), 6-28-
83)
§ 18-34. Same—Agreements required.
   (a)   Applications for extension of city water and/or sewer services will
generally not be considered unless:
      (1)   The subdivider, developer or property owner agrees in writing that
the area so served, if not already inside the city limits, will be annexed to
the city at the city's option at such time as the city determines such
annexation is in the best interest of the city and the area so served and the
subdivider, developer or property owner agrees therein not to protest such
annexation.
      (2)   The subdivider, developer or property owner agrees to pay the cost
of all local water distribution mains, including valves, fire hydrants, fire
hydrant gauge mains, and service connections, and the cost of all collector
sewers, including manholes and service connections, under one or other of the
payment plans set out in sections
18-35 and 18-36.
      (3)   The subdivider, developer or property owner agrees to furnish
without the cost to the city sufficient and adequate easements on which water
or sewer mains may be placed within the area to be served.
      (4)   The subdivider, developer or property owner understands his
obligation to abide by the subdivision and zoning regulations of the Danville-
Boyle County Planning and Zoning Commission and the
Standard Construction Specifications, Rules and Regulations of the city.
      (5)   It is understood and agreed that in areas where annexation is
reasonably certain in the foreseeable future, the city water service will not
be extended unless city sanitary sewer service is also extended.
   It is intended that the requirements set out hereinabove be included in a
written agreement between the city and the subdivider, developer or property
owner as a condition precedent to any and all extension of water or sanitary
sewer service to the area being developed, whether within or without the city
limits.
   "Extension" shall be defined as any addition to the existing system and/or
any change in the scope of existing services.
   (b)   The above requirements apply to such applications; however, the board
of commissioners may, by resolution or order, grant a waiver of any or all of
these provisions when it is deemed to be in the best interest of the city to do
so.
(Code 1977, § 11.080; Ord. No. 1289, § 1, 5-12-81; Ord. No. 1317, § 1(4), 6-28-
83)
§ 18-35. Developed areas.
   (a)   Water distribution mains or local collector sewers in developed areas
where numerous property owners are involved shall be installed and paid for
under one (1) of the following payment plans:
      (1)   Deferred annexation. Property owners must organize and make their
own arrangements to construct, operate and pay for required facilities subject
to all the terms and conditions set out in this division, including section
18-36(a)(2)a; and dedication of facilities to city without cost and in first
class condition upon such annexation completion.
      (2)   Presently inside city limits or immediate annexation. Installation
and payment shall be by one (1) of two (2) methods;
         a.   All benefited property owners shall pay into an escrow fund an
amount equal to their proportionate share of the total estimated cost of the
installation of water or sanitary sewers prior to the beginning of
construction. The basis of prorating the costs shall be determined by mutual
agreement between the city and the property owners on the front foot, land
value or other such mutually acceptable basis. When the entire amount has been
paid into the escrow fund, the city shall then cause the construction to be
accomplished under its usual and customary procedures for public works
construction. At the completion of construction when actual costs are known,
the escrow account shall be adjusted either up or down, whichever may apply,
with each property owner paying to or receiving from the fund his appropriate
share to properly adjust said fund to the actual coat of the work.
         b.   Installation by the city on an assessment basis under applicable
chapter of KRS.
   (b)   Method a. above will require the concurrence of all property owners
within the area proposed to be benefited, whereas method b. can be undertaken
in accordance with KRS.
(Code 1977, § 11.080; Ord. No. 1289, § 1, 5-12-81; Ord. No. 1317, § 1(4), 6-28-
83)
§ 18-36. Undeveloped areas.
   (a)   Local water distribution mains or local collector sewers in
undeveloped areas shall be undertaken and paid for by one of the following
methods:
      (1)   Deferred annexation. The subdivider, or developer, must make his
own arrangements to construct, and pay for required facilities subject to all
terms and conditions set out in this division, including subsection (2)a. of
this section and dedication of facilities to city without cost and in first
class condition upon such completion;
      (2)   Immediate annexation or presently inside of city limits.
Installations and payment shall be by one (1) of the following methods:
         a.   Full cost of the installation of water mains and sanitary sewers
to be borne by the subdivider or developer under whatever terms may be included
in a contract between the city and the subdivider or developer. Installations
by this procedure may be planned or constructed by either party to the contact.
If the subdivider or developer undertakes the construction with his own forces
or contracts for such construction, he shall be wholly and entirely responsible
to see that the work conforms to the city's current Standard
Specifications for Water and Sewer Construction. In order to ensure compliance
with city specifications, it shall be his responsibility to pay the cost of
providing an adequate number of competent, approved resident inspectors during
construction. Completed facilities must meet the required performance tests.
         b.   Installation by the city on an assessment basis under applicable
chapter of KRS.
   (b)   Trunk sewer mains in undeveloped areas shall be undertaken and paid
for by one of the following methods:
      (1)   Construction of sewer trunk mains, major pumping stations or other
sewer facilities which service large areas of the city will be built by the
city. The cost of these sewer facilities shall be shared by the city, the
developer, and/or property owners who have need of the sewer system. It is
intended that the city's share of the cost will be recovered by charge of tap
fees on all services connected to this pipe within twenty (20) years of the
completion of the project. A financial analysis should be made to determine if
the city can reasonably expect a return on its investment as revenue expected
from tap fees. The share required of the developer shall be equal to an amount
equal to one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per acre, not to exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the total project. The tap fees shall be calculated
based on number of acres expected to develop within twenty (20) years. Each tap
will be charged a fee equal to the amount calculated per acre times the acreage
in the lot. A written agreement containing these details is required between
city and the developer.

   (j)   Connection to Public Sewer. The building sewer shall be connected into
the public sewer at the curb or property line, if a service branch sewer or wye
is available at a suitable location. Where no property located service branch
sewer or wye is available an authorized agent of the superintendent will cut a
neat hole into the main line of the public sewer and install a suitable wye or
tee saddle and extend a service branch sewer at such a point of connection with
a wye saddle shall be in the upper quadrant of the main line of the public
sewer. A neat workmanlike connection not extending past the inner surface of
the main public sewer will be made and the saddle made secure and watertight by
encasement in concrete.
   (k)   Elevation. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to
the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in
which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,
sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved
means and discharged to the building sewer. No sanitary inlet which is lower
than six (6) inches above the top of the lowest of the two (2) adjacent public
sanitary sewer manholes shall be connected by direct drainage to the building
sanitary sewer.
   (l)   Trenches. All excavations required for the installation of a building
sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the
superintendent; and all such trenches shall be kept open until the pipe has
been inspected, tested and approved by the superintendent. Except where bends
are supplied, trenches shall be straight in direction and grade to accommodate
prefabricated joints. Trenches shall be at least twenty (20) inches wide
opposite center line of the pipe. Building sanitary sewers laid in undisturbed
ground must be laid on at least six (6) inches of pea gravel, sand, or other
approved grillage to support the pipe. The trench shall be filled with the same
approved grillage on each side of the pipe and six (6) inches over the same.
   (m)   Connection of Surface Runoff or Groundwater to Building Senior. No
person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains,
areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building
sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a
public sanitary sewer.
   (n)   New Connections From Inflow Sources. New connections to the sanitary
sewer systems from inflow sources is prohibited, as defined and in satisfaction
of the requirements of Regulation No. 35.927.4 promulgated under Title II of
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, or any amendment
thereof.
   (o)   Barricading and Lighting; Restoring Excavations. All excavations for
building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded for barricades and
lights so as to protect the public from hazards. Furthermore, all pertinent and
applicable OSHA requirement shall be met. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and
other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in
a manner satisfactory to the superintendent.
   (p)   Connection at Property Line or Easement; Wye or Tee Connections. The
building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the easement or
property line. Where no properly located service branch is available, an
authorized agent of the superintendent shall cut a neat hole into the main line
of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle installed to receive the
building sewer. The invert of the building sewer at such point of connection
with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant of the main line of the public
sewer. A neat workmanlike connection not extending past the inner surface of
the public sewer shall be made and the saddle made secure and watertight by
encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A wye and H
bend fitting shall be installed at the property line between the public sewer
and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a cleanout and
for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After the testing, a
riser will be inserted in this fitting and brought flush with the ground
surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type joint applicable to the pipe
used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion of groundwater or surface
water.
   (q)   Inspections, Notification. The applicant for the building sewer
permit, or his licensed plumber, shall notify the superintendent when the
building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The
inspection shall be made within a reasonable period of time after the receipt
of notice. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
superintendent or his representative.
   (r)   Testing. All building sewers shall be smoke or air tested through the
wye and H bend fitting at the public sewer connection, with public sewer
tightly plugged off, after connections at both ends are made and after all pipe
is properly bedded and backfilled to the top of pipe. At time of test, any
openings into the building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or
plugged. Any leakage of smoke from building sewer or building drain and
plumbing shall be located at test and repaired to stand repetition of smoke
test without leakage. A suitable low-pressure air test may be considered to be
equal to smoke testing. All trenches or other excavated areas shall be kept
open until the pipe has been tested and approved by the superintendent.

   (d)   Discharge of Potentially Harmful Wastes. No person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged the following described substances, materials, waters or
wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the superintendent that such
wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment;
endanger life, limb or public property; or constitute a nuisance. In forming
his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the superintendent will
give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in
relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of
the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage
treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment
plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are:
      (1)   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred
fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius). However, the
temperature of sewage at the point of entry into the sewage treatment plant
shall not exceed one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit, and in the event of
such occurrence, the superintendent shall have appropriate authority to
determine the cause of major causes of such excessive temperature and shall
have the authority to exercise those procedures and remedies set forth in
subsection (f).

forth in the federal pretreatment standards mentioned in paragraph (4), or any
other requirements or standards of the state, federal, or other public agencies
of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
      (6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      (7)   Materials which exert or cause:
         a.   Concentrations of inert suspended solids exceeding three hundred
fifty (350) milligrams per liter, such as, but not limited to, fuller's earth,
lime slurries, and lime residues; or of dissolved solids in quantities
sufficient to have a detrimental effect on the treatment process;
         b.   Excessive discolorations exceeding three hundred (300) standard
color units, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions, unless approved by the superintendent.
         c.   Unusual chemical requirements which constitute a significant load

effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
   (e)   Industrial Discharge Limits. The superintendent of the WWTP is
authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). These
limitations are for characteristics of any wastewaters to be discharged into
the municipal sewer system, subject to any compliance schedule as established
in the industrial user permit. All significant industrial users must comply
with these discharge limitations where they are more stringent than applicable
state and federal regulations. Based upon the sampling program at the Danville
Wastewater Treatment Plant, the discharge limitations may be adjusted to
reflect the POTW's needs. The following individual waste limitations are
provided in addition to others set forth in this division:

   (f)   Actions Regarding Potentially Harmful Wastes. If any waters or wastes
are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which
waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in this
section and which in the judgment of the superintendent may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
superintendent may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes.
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers.
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions
of subsection (k).
   If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the superintendent, and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (g)   Grease, Oil, Sand Interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients;
except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters
or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the superintendent and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the
owner shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate
means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and
means of disposal which are subject to review by the superintendent.
   (h)   Preliminary Treatment; Flow-Equalizing Facilities. Where preliminary
treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for the wastes or waters,
they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation
by the owner at his expense.
   (i)   Control Manhole. When required by the superintendent, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install
a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the industrial wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be
installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so to be
safe and accessible at all times.
   (j)   Measurements, Testing, Analysis. All mea- surements, tests, and
analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made
in this division shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR 136 or other
applicable standard or authority, and shall be determined at the control
manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The cost
of having tests run on industrial waste shall be at the expense of the
industrial user.
   (k)   Special Agreements Between City and Industrial Users. No statement
contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city
for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern. However,
any such special agreement the city and any industrial user cannot be less
stringent than any applicable federal pretreatment standard or categorical
regulation pursuant to Section 307 of the Clean Water Act and must be approved
by the office of the Pretreatment Section KPDES Branch Division of Water.
   (l)   Emptying Septic Tanks or Grease Traps Outside City Limits Into Sewer
System. Before any person shall empty the contents of septic tanks or grease
traps located outside the city limits into the sewer system of the city, he
shall first secure a permit from the superintendent and shall pay a fee in
accordance with the schedule maintained by the superintendent. In addition, no
such matter shall be emptied into the sewer system except at such locations as
designated by the superintendent. Furthermore, the content of such matter shall
not violate the requirements and restrictions set forth in this section.
   (m)   National Categorical Standards. The City of Danville has received
authority through the U.S. EPA and state statutes to enforce the requirements
of 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, parts 405-471 and 40 CFR part 403. All users
shall comply with the requirements of those regulations. The WWTP
superintendent and/or his designee may require the development and
implementation of best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in
individual wastewater discharge permits to implement local limits and the
requirements of this ordinance.
(Ord. No. 1331, § II, 7-10-84; Ord. No. 1277, Art. VI, 7-8-80; Ord. No. 1450, §
3, 4, 8-27-91; Ord. No. 1630, 7-8-02; Ord. No. 1640, 11-25-02; Ord. No. 1803, §

§ 18-57. Pretreatment of incompatible pollutants by industrial users.
   In addition to the requirements set forth in section
18-56, which section applies to all users, including industrial users, all
industrial users are further required to meet the pretreatment requirements
Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available (BPT) if they are
discharging incompatible or toxic pollutants, as defined by the applicable
federal pretreatment regulations. The superintendent or other authorized agent
of the city shall be allowed to enforce upon industrial users any and all
pretreatment requirements necessary to ensure compliance by the city with the
terms and conditions of its NPDES permit, as well as to ensure compliance by
all industrial users with the pretreatment standards and any other applicable
requirements promulgated pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,
or other federal laws and regulations.
(Ord. No. 1277, Art. VII, 7-8-80)
§ 18-58. Additional disposal requirements.
   (a)   Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions contained in this
division, and in addition thereto, it shall be unlawful for any person to
dispose into the sewage works any pollutant except in compliance with federal
standards promulgated pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendment of 1972, and other applicable federal law, as may from time to time
be enacted.
   (b)   All users must notify the superintendent of any hazardous wastes
discharges to the POTW. Notification must comply with requirements of 40 CFR
403.12(p).
(Ord. No. 1277, Art. VIII, 7-8-80; Ord. No. 1450, § 5, 8-27-91)
§ 18-59. Significant industrial user.
   (a)   A significant industrial user shall be defined in section
18-52. Any change in the definition of a significant industrial user as a
result of promulgations in response to section 307 of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act, or other applicable law, shall immediately become a part
of this division.
   (b)   All significant industrial users, categorical industrial users and
other industrial users as deemed necessary by the superintendent, shall file to
the superintendent quarterly reports or on dates specified in the industrial
user permit, unless required more frequently by the permit, a report
indicating, at a minimum, the nature and concentration of pollutants in the
effluent which are limited by pretreatment standards or the discharge permit.
The report shall also include the chain-of-custody (COC) forms, field data and
any other information required by the superintendent. In addition, this report
shall include a record of all daily flows or the average daily flow. At the
discretion of the superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local
high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the superintendent may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
40 CFR 403.12 and this division.
   (c)   The significant industrial users shall employ such methods and
procedures for sampling, preparing of records and reports, and using and
maintaining monitoring equipment as required by the superintendent. Test
procedures shall be set forth in 40 CFR 136.3, and other applicable federal
regulations. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge. All analyses shall be performed by a
laboratory acceptable to the city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance
with procedures established by the U.S. EPA Administrator pursuant to Section
304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto and
40 CFR 261 or with any other test procedures approved by the U.S. EPA
Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator. Except as indicated in subsections (a)
and (b) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24)-
hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the superintendent. Where
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
superintendent, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four
(24)-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the superintendent, as appropriate. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
limits. (a) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques. (b) For sampling required in support of baseline
monitoring and ninety (90)-day compliance reports required in 40 CFR 403.12(b)
and (d), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the superintendent may authorize a
lower minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to
assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant(s) in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication
"Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants," April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
   (d)   If sampling methods and laboratory procedures by and for the
industrial user fail to provide the information required, and further provided
that the superintendent:
      (1)   Has good reason to believe that the industrial user is in
noncompliance with all or part of its permit; or
      (2)   Believes the industrial user be causing excessive maintenance with
transmission facilities or upsets of the biological treatment processes;
   The superintendent shall first notify in writing the offending or
noncomplying user and shall give such user a reasonable time in which to take
such remedial action deemed necessary by the superintendent; and if the user
fails to do so, then the superintendent shall follow the enforcement actions as
provided for in this division and the city's enforcement response plan. The
superintendent shall be authorized to obtain the services of outside
specialists, consultants or laboratory services to sample and/or analyze the
sewage discharge by the industry. The cost of these services shall be at the
expense of the industry.
   (e)   All significant industrial users must report all self-monitoring
results that the user has obtained whether requested or not. The user may not
change any monitoring points prior to approval in writing by the
superintendent.
   (f)   All SIU must notify the superintendent immediately of any slug loading
or hazardous waste discharge by the industrial user. Upon notification of such
slug the superintendent may within seven (7) days notify the industrial user of
the requirements of a slug control plan. The required plan will contain the
elements as follows, along with other requirements as necessary by the
superintendent.
      (1)   Description of discharge practices.
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals.
      (3)   Procedures for notification of the POTW.
      (4)   Prevention procedures for spills.

§ 18-60. Powers and authority of inspectors.
   (a)   Right of Entry; Cooperation With. All agents of the sewage works of
the city and of the state and/or EPA, bearing proper credentials and
identification, shall be permitted to enter all properties, including that of
all industrial users, for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, and testing. All industrial users shall cooperate with such agents
and officials as may be necessary to enforce the compliance of all federal and
state laws.
   (b)   Right of Entry Onto Easements. The superintendent and other duly
authorized employees or consultants of the city bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which
the city holds a duly negotiated easement and/or; a contractual agreement for
entry for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the sewage
facilities lying within such easement, All entry and subsequent work, if any,
on such easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly
negotiated easement and/or contractual agreement for entry pertaining to the
private property involved.
   (c)   Obtaining Information. The superintendent or other duly authorized
employees are authorized to obtain information concerning industrial processes
which have a direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the sewage
collection system. The industry may withhold information proven to be
confidential. The industry must establish that the revelation to the public of
the information in question might result in an advantage to competitors. The
city shall be empowered to seek judicial determination as to any claims of
confidentiality.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless
the user specifically requests in writing and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the user.
   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made

may modify an industrial user permit for good cause, including, but not limited
to, the following reasons:
      (1)   To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirements;
      (2)   To address significant alterations or additions to the user's
operation, processes or wastewater volume or character since the time of the
individual wastewater discharge permit issuance;
      (3)   A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent
reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
      (4)   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat
to the Danville POTW, personnel, biosolids disposal and/or the receiving
stream;
      (5)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the industrial user permit;
      (6)   Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting;
      (7)   Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment
standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13; or
      (8)   To correct typographical or other errors in the discharge permit.
   (d)   Conditions of Permits. Wastewater discharge permits and wastewater
contribution permits shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this
division and all other applicable regulations, user charges and fees
established by the city. The superintendent may authorize an industrial user
subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a
pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial
user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the
pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge or is
present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in
the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is
subject to the conditions established in 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2). Permits may
contain the following:
      (1)   The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the
wastewater to be discharged to a community sewer.
      (2)   Effluent limits, including best management practices and slug
controls, on the average and maximum rate and time of discharge or requirements
for flow regulations and equalization, wastewater constituents and
characteristics.
      (3)   Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and
sampling facilities.
      (4)   Specifications for monitoring programs; which may include sampling
locations, frequency of sampling, number, types and standards for tests and
reporting scheduling.
      (5)   Compliance schedules.
      (6)   Requirements for submission of technical reports or discharge
reports. See subsections (f) and (g) of this section.
      (7)   Requirements for maintaining and retaining plant records relating
to wastewater discharge as specified by the city; and affording city access
thereto as required by 40 CFR 403.12(o)(2).
      (8)   Requirements for notification to the city of any new introduction
of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character
of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the wastewater treatment
systems.
      (9)   Requirements for notification of slug discharges as per section 18-
56(d)(7)d.
      (10)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the city to ensure
compliance with this division.
      (11)   Where an effluent from an industrial process is mixed prior to
treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process,
fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge permit by
the superintendent. These alternative limits shall be applied to the mixed
effluent. These alternative limits shall be calculated using the combined
wastestream formula and/or flow- weighted average formula given in 40 CFR 403.6
(e). Where the effluent limits in a categorical pretreatrnent standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production
(production-based standard), the superintendent may convert the limits to
equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant that may be
discharged per day or of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent permit limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be
subject to all permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c)
and must fully comply with these alternative limits. All categorical industrial
users subject to production-based standards must report production rates
annually so that alternative permit limits can be calculated if necessary. The
categorical industrial user must notify the superintendent thirty (30) days in
advance of any change in production levels that might affect the flow or other
data used to calculate the effluent limits in the discharge permit.
      (12)   The permit may require the user to reimburse the city for all
expenses related to monitoring, sampling and testing performed at the direction
of the superintendent and deemed necessary by the city to verify that the user
is in compliance with the permit.
      (13)   A statement that indicates the industrial user permit issuance
date, expiration date and effective date.
      (14)   A statement that the industrial user permit is nontransferable.
      (15)   Requirements to control slug discharge, if determined by the
superintendent to be necessary.
      (16)   The process for seeking a waiver from monitoring for a pollutant
neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge in accordance with
this chapter. Any grant of a waiver by the superintendent must be included as a
condition in the user's permit.
      (17)   A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for
violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable
compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance
beyond that required by applicable federal, state or local law.
   (e)   Duration of Permits. Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five (5) years. A permit may be issued for a period less
than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply
for permit reissuance a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing permit, The terms and conditions of the
permit may be subject to modification by the city during the term of the permit
as limitations or requirements as identified in subsections (b) through (d) of
this section are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be
informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least thirty (30) days prior
to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit
shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
   (f)   Transfer of Wastewater Discharge Permit. Wastewater discharge permits
are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge
permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user,
different premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval of the
city. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and
conditions of the existing permit.
   (g)   Compliance Data Report. Within ninety (90) days following the date for
final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a
new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the
POTW, any user subject to federal categorical pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the superintendent a report indicating the nature
and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process
which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average
and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user’s facility which are
limited by such categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. The report
shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or
requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional
operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user
into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user, and certified to by a qualified professional.
   (h)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)   All significant industrial users shall submit to the superintendent
quarterly reports, unless required more frequently in the wastewater
contribution permit or by the superintendent, a report indicating the nature
and concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or the wastewater contribution permit. The report shall
also include all information necessary to determine that best management
practices are being implemented as required, the chain-of-custody (COC) forms,
field data and any other information required by the superintendent. In
addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows or the average
daily flow. At the discretion of the superintendent and in consideration of
factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the
superintendent may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are
to be submitted. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12 and section 52.61 of this chapter. Users
subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make
available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional
records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by
the user independent of such requirements and documentation associated with
best management practices as may be required. Records shall include the date,
exact place, method and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking
the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the
analytical techniques or methods used and the results of such analyses. These
records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This
period shall automatically be extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning the user or the city or where the user has been specifically
notified of a longer retention by the superintendent.
      Where compliance schedules are required, the following conditions shall
apply:
         A.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);
         B.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months; and
         C.   The user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule. The following
conditions shall apply to all compliance schedules required by this division:
            (i)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards.
            (ii)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months.
            (iii)   The user shall submit a progress report to the
superintendent no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or
not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and,
if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule; and in no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the superintendent.
      (2)   The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in
other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such
cases, the report required by paragraph (1) of this subsection (h) shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the
effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where requested by the superintendent, of pollutants
contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards.
The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standard. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the administrator pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test
procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. Where 40 CFR part
136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in
question sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the EPA publication, "Sampling and Analysis Procedures
for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants," April 1977, and
amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures
approved by the administrator.
   (i)   General. The city through the superintendent or his designee, to
insure compliance with this division, and as permitted through 40 CFR
Subchapter N, 401 through 471 and 401 KAR 5:055, Section 9 may take the
following enforcement steps against users in noncompliance with this division.
The remedies available to the superintendent include injunctive relief, civil
and criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of discharges and/or water
service, and the publishing of the list of significant violators annually. The
enforcement authority shall be vested in the superintendent of the POTW or his/
her designee. All violations of requirements of this division must be reviewed
and responded to by the superintendent or his representative. In general, the
superintendent shall notify the industrial user when a violation occurs. For
all violations, the superintendent shall receive an explanation and, as
appropriate, a plan from the industrial user to correct the violation within a
specific time period. If the violation(s) persist or the explanation and/or
plan are not adequate, the superintendent's response shall be more formal; and
commitments or schedules, as appropriate, for compliance will be established in
an enforceable document. The enforcement response selected will be related to
the seriousness of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if
compliance is not achieved expeditiously after the initial action. A
significant violation will require a formal enforcement action. The full scale
of enforcement actions will be detailed in the city's pretreatment program
enforcement response plan.
   The superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a
wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary, in the
opinion of the superintendent, in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to
the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES permit.
   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or
the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the superintendent shall take such steps as deemed
necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection and/or water
service to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The superintendent may reinstate the wastewater contribution
permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of
the non-complying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within fifteen
(15) days of the date of occurrence.
   (j)   Enforcement Actions.
      (1)   Informal notice: These actions include statements made to the
industrial user during sampling and/or inspection visits, telephone calls to
the appropriate company official, informal meetings, warning or reminder
letters. These informal notices shall be used for minor violations.
      (2)   Formal notice: These actions include the following:
         a.   Administrative order: Any person found to be violating any
provision of this division, wastewater discharge permit, or any order issued
hereunder shall be served by the POTW superintendent with a written notice
staling the nature of the violation. The offender must permanently cease all
violations.
         b.   Show-cause hearing: The superintendent may issue to any user who
causes or contributes to violations of this division, discharge permit or order
issued hereunder an order to appear and show cause why more severe enforcement
action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place of the hearing to be held by the superintendent regarding the
violation and the reasons why the action is to be taken. The notice of the
hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be
made on any agent or officer of the facility. Whether or not a duly notified
industrial user or its representative appears, immediate enforcement action may
be pursued.
      The city itself may conduct the hearing and take evidence or may
designate a representative to:
            (i)   Issue in the name of the city notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in such hearings.
            (ii)   Take the evidence.
            (iii)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, together
with recom mendations of the city for action thereon.
      After the city has reviewed the evidence, it may issue a note to the user
responsible for the violation directing that, following a specified time
period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Further notices and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
   (k)   Protection from Accidental and Slug Discharges.
      (1)   Each significant user shall provide protection from accidental and/
or slug discharges of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this ordinance which adversely affects the POTW. Facilities to prevent
accidental and/or slug discharges of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Once every two (2)
years, the superintendent will determine whether each industrial user needs to
develop or update a plan to control slug discharges. If the superintendent
determines that a slug control plan or revision is necessary, the plan shall
contain the following:
         a.   Description of discharge practices.
         b.   Description of stored chemicals.
         c.   Procedures for notifying POTW.
         d.   Prevention procedures for spills.
   In the case of all possible or actual accidental and/or slug discharges, it
is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW
of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
      (2)   Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental
discharge, the user shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator a detailed
written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by
this article, the enforcement response plan or other applicable law.
      (3)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   (l)   Pretreatment. All significant industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this ordinance and achieve
compliance with any applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards
within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment
regulations. The city may require the development of a compliance schedule for
installation of pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any industrial user
that cannot meet discharge limits required by this ordinance. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level required by this ordinance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the pretreatment coordinator for review, and shall be acceptable to the city
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an effluent that complies with the
provisions of this ordinance. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.

§ 18-109. Penalties and enforcement.
   Any person who violates the provisions of this article, who fails to carry
out duties and responsibilities imposed by this article, or who impedes or
interferes with any action undertaken or ordered pursuant to this article shall
be subject to the following penalties.
   (a)   If the mayor, city manager, any law enforcement officer, city
engineer, utility director, or other city official or officials charged with
implementation and enforcement of this article or a water supply shortage or
emergency resolution learn of any violation of any water use restriction
imposed pursuant to this article, a written notice of the violation shall be
affixed to the property where the violation occurred and either mailed or
delivered to the consumer of record and to any other person known to the city
who is responsible for the violation or its correction. Said notice shall
describe the violation and order that it be corrected, cured or abated
immediately or within such specified time as the city determines is reasonable
under the circumstances. If the order is not complied with, the city may
terminate water service to the consumer subject to the following procedures.
      (1)   The city shall give the consumer notice by either mail or delivery
that water services will be discontinued within a specified time due to the
violation and that the consumer will have the opportunity to appeal the
termination by requesting a hearing scheduled before the city governing body or
a city official designated as a hearing officer by the governing body.
      (2)   If such a hearing is requested by the consumer charged with
violation, he or she shall be given an opportunity to be heard before
termination is ordered.
      (3)   The governing body or hearing officer shall make findings of fact
and order whether service should be terminated.
   (b)   A fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be paid for the reconnection of
any water service terminated pursuant to subsection (a). In the event of
subsequent violations during a continuous period of declared shortage or
emergency, the reconnection fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the
second violation and three hundred dollars ($300.00) for any additional
violations.
   (c)   Any person violating this article may also be prosecuted in Boyle
District Court. Any person so charged and found guilty of violating the
provisions of this article shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor. Each day's
violation shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty for an initial
violation shall be a mandatory fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), which may
not be adjusted by the court. In addition, such person may be required by the
court to serve a definite term of confinement in the county jail, which shall
be fixed by the court and which shall not exceed thirty (30) days. The penalty
for a second violation during a continuous period of declared shortage or
emergency shall be a mandatory fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00) which may
not be adjusted by the court. In addition, such person shall serve a definite
term of confinement in the county jail which shall be fixed by the court and
which shall not exceed thirty (30) days. Penalties for additional violations
shall be the same as for the second violation,

Chapter 19 ZONING*
   
Sec. 19-1.   Adoption of zoning provisions.
   *Editor's note--Ord. No. 1399, adopted July 13, 1988, which adopted the
"Zoning Ordinance for Boyle County and the Cities of Danville, Junction City
and Perryville," was not specifically amendatory of the Code; therefore, it has
been treated as superseding the provisions of former § 19-1 and § 19-2, and
adopted by reference as § 19-1 at the discretion of the editor. Former § 19-1,
provisions saved from repeal, derived from the Code of 1977, §§ 101.120-
101.616; and former § 19-2, amendments, derived from Ord. No. 1364, adopted May
27, 1986. Copies of the zoning ordinance are on file and available for
inspection in the office of the city clerk.

ORDINANCE DISPOSITION TABLE FOR 1977 CODE OF ORDINANCES
   The following disposition table consists of a chronological or numerical
enumeration of all ordinances passed of record in the City of Danville,
Kentucky prior to adoption of the 1977 Code of Ordinances. In addition to the
ordinance number and date of passage, a brief description of the topic matter
contained in the ordinance, along with the current status of the ordinance and
the location of the ordinance in this Code, is given.
   The table is not intended nor shall it be construed to be a part of the Code
or to have any legal effect. In the event of error, mistake, or conflict with
the code as to any information contained in the following table, the Code shall
prevail. This table is intended merely for the convenience of the user and to
provide a quick reference or comparison between the old ordinances and the new
codification.
   The following symbols used under the heading of “Current Status” shall have
the following meaning:
   E = effective
   R = repealed
   S = superseded
The numerical numbers immediately following some of the above symbols are
references to ordinances numbers. For example, Ordinance Number 3 was
superseded by Ordinance Number 15; Ordinance Number 51 was repealed by
Ordinance Number 1015. The user will immediately note the table does not
provide information as to the specific ordinance which either superseded or
repealed a specific ordinance in the majority of the cases. This is for the
obvious reason that many ordinances are repealed or superseded by implication
or by virtue of a conflict with a later enacted ordinance. In such event, it is
difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain precisely in every event the
specific affected or affecting ordinance.
The heading “1977 Code” indicates whether or not the ordinance, or any part
thereof, is contained in the 1977 Code. If the ordinance is not contained
within the code, the symbol “NI” meaning “not included” is entered in the
appropriate column. If the ordinance is contained in the Code, the chapter or
chapter numbers in which the ordinance is contained is entered in the
appropriate column.

ORDINANCE DISPOSITION TABLE FOR THIS CODE OF ORDINANCES
   The following disposition table consists of a chronological or numerical
enumeration of all ordinances passed of record in the City of Danville,
Kentucky after the 1977 Codification. In addition to the ordinance number and
date of passage, a brief description of the topic matter contained in the
ordinance, along with the current status of the ordinance in this Code is
given.
   The table is not intended nor shall it be construed to be a part of the Code
or to have any legal effect. In the event of error, mistake, or conflict with
the code as to any information contained in the following table, the Code shall
prevail. This table is intended merely for the convenience of the user and to
provide a quick reference or comparison between the old ordinances and the new
codification.
   The following symbols used under the heading of “Current Status” shall have
the following meaning:
   E = effective
   R = repealed
   S = superseded
The numerical numbers immediately following some of the above symbols are
references to ordinance numbers. For example, Ordinance Number 1270 was
repealed by Ordinance Number 1316. The user will immediately note the table
does not provide information as to the specific ordinance which either
superseded or repealed a specific ordinance in the majority of the cases. This
is for the obvious reason that many ordinances are repealed or superseded by
implication or by virtue of a conflict with a later enacted ordinance. In such
event, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain precisely in every
event the specific affected or affecting ordinance.
   The heading “Section this Code” indicates whether or not the ordinance, or
any part thereof, is contained in this Code. If the ordinance is not contained
within the Code, the symbol “NI”, meaning “not included” is entered in the
appropriate column. If the ordinance is contained in the Code, the section
number or numbers in which the ordinance is contained is entered in the
appropriate column.
