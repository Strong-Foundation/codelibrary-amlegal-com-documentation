subsequent meeting of Council as long as it takes effect prior to the effective
date of the original repealer.

unchanged with respect to an amendment which is repealed at the same meeting of
Council which enacted the amendment.

with respect to that amendment if the ordinance making the amendment is
repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of Council as long as the
repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the original
amendment.
   (E)   No other action of Council repealing a repealer or an amendment shall
have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or amendment
as the case may be.
(KRS 446.100)
§ 10.09 RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES ACCRUING BEFORE REPEAL OF ORDINANCE.
   No new ordinance shall be construed to repeal a former ordinance as to any
offense committed against a former ordinance, nor as to any act done, or
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred, or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance

clearly intended to express the intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and

manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the

§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.

records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872 (6))

to provide a written response, a complaining party shall provide a copy of the
written request. The Attorney General shall review the request and denial and

a written decision stating whether the agency violated provisions of KRS 61.870

twenty (20) day time limit by sending written notice to the complaining party

legal holidays. As used in this section, UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES means, but only

agency for substantiation. The Attorney General may also request a copy of the
records involved , but they shall not be disclosed.
   (C)   Each agency shall notify the Attorney General of any actions filed
against that agency in circuit court regarding the enforcement of KRS 61.870 to

circuit court actions regarding the enforcement of KRS 61.870 to 61.884, nor
shall he have any duty to defend his decision in circuit court or any
subsequent proceedings.
   (D)   If a person feels the intent of KRS 61.870 to 61.884 is being
subverted by an agency short of denial of inspection, including but not limited
to the imposition of excessive fees, delay past the five (5) day period
described in division (A) of this section, excessive extensions of time, or the
misdirection of the applicant, the person may complain in writing to the
Attorney General, and the complaint shall be subject to the same adjudicatory
process as if the record had been denied.
   (E)   (1)   A party shall have thirty (30) days from the day that the
Attorney General renders his decision to appeal the decision. An appeal within
the thirty (30) day time limit shall be treated as if it were an action brought
under KRS 61.882.
      (2)   If an appeal is not filed within the thirty (30) day time limit,
the Attorney General's decision shall have the force and effect of law and
shall be enforceable in the circuit court of the county where the public agency
has its principal place of business or the circuit court of the county where
the public record is maintained.

§ 51.07 CITY TO ACCEPT DEDICATED STREETS AND STORM SEWERS FOR MAINTENANCE
PURPOSES.
   (A)   All public improvements consisting of streets and storm sewers within
the city which have been dedicated to public use, which have been platted, and
which plats have been approved by the City Planning and Zoning Commission,
shall be accepted by the city for maintenance purposes.
   (B)   All public improvements including streets and storm sewers, except for
any streets which are included in the country road system or the state road
system, which streets, sanitary sewers, and storm sewers are considered to be
owned by the city, are hereby accepted by the city for maintenance purposes.
   (C)   In situations where a property owner and/or developer have had a
subdivision final plat approved conditionally by the Planning Commission and/or
have offered for dedication public improvements which are not yet completed in
situations where a construction guaranty and bond have been put in place, and
the completion of the public improvements are expected to take over four weeks;
or in a situation wherein the plat has been conditionally approved or approved
subject to a construction guaranty/bond and the public improvements have not
been completed within four weeks of such approval, a sign shall be posted in
the subdivision designed to notify the public of such facts under the following
circumstances:
      (1)   Intent. The intent of this division (C) is to provide guidelines
for the city to install temporary signs at the entrance to future public
dedicated improvements in which the applicant has applied for and received
conditional approval of final plats, thus allowing the applicant to transfer
title of real property prior to completing all improvements.
      (2)   Purpose. The purpose for posting the sign is to protect citizens
who may be unaware that the public improvement, for which the sign is posted,
is not accepted for maintenance by the legislative body. This situation exists
primarily when a final plat is accepted with contingencies and when a bond has
been posted for the uncompleted improvements. The unknowing public may
logically assume, by appearance, that the improvements have been accepted by
the city. This situation could be very harmful to the public should the
applicant fail to meet contingencies set forth for approval of the final plat
and the street not be accepted by the city. This notification is for the
protection of the health and welfare of the citizens of the city.
      (3)   Application. The informative sign should be used when conditions
warrant. Those conditions include, but are not limited to, the following: When
the time taken by the applicant to comply with all relevant contingencies of
the final plat is shorter than four weeks from the time of the conditional
approval, there is no need for the sign.
      (4)   Responsibility. It shall be the responsibility of the Mayor to see
that the appropriate signs are installed in timely manner at the proper
location so that the intent of this division is complied with. The signs shall
be installed in a timely manner. The signs shall be removed upon acceptance of
the improvements by the city, or the withdrawal of the application by the
applicant.

wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of the constituents upon the sewage works and to determine
the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from periodic
grab samples.

different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or "Go": Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop": Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed
until it can do so without danger.
   (E)   Flashing yellow alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall
reduce its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection controlled by
such signal.
   (F)   "Yield Right-of-Way": Vehicular traffic facing the “Yield Right-of-
Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a “Yield Right-of-Way”
sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a speed in excess
of fifteen (15) miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not apply to
vehicles entering an expressway.
   (G)   Lane lights: When lane lights are installed over any street for the
purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing yellow lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from

§ 90.17 VICIOUS AND DANGEROUS ANIMALS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, a VICIOUS OR DANGEROUS ANIMAL is
defined as:
      (1)   Any animal which constitutes a physical threat to human beings or
other domestic animals by virtue of a known or displayed propensity to endanger
by pursuing, wounding, or attacking any other domestic animal or human being,
whether or not such dangerous animal bears any license tag required by state
law. Exceptions - Any animal shall not be deemed dangerous if:
         (a)   It bites, attacks, or menaces anyone assaulting its owner, or
any person or other animal who has tormented or abused it; or
         (b)   It is otherwise acting in defense of an attack from a person or
other animal upon the owner or other person; or
         (c)   It is protecting or defending its young or other domestic
animal.
      (2)   Any animal trained, owned, or harbored for the purpose, primarily
or in part, of animal fighting.
      (3)   Any animal which has been trained to attack persons independently
or upon oral command, excepting animals owned by public law enforcement
agencies.
      (4)   If any animal attacks or injures or attempts to injure any person
unprovoked, such conduct is prima facie evidence that the animal is vicious and
dangerous.
      (5)   Likewise, it is prima facie evidence that the animal is vicious and
dangerous if any animal has approached and/or chased a human being or domestic
animal in such a terrorizing manner as to reasonably require the human being or
domestic animal to seek immediate shelter or to require the human being or
domestic animal to defend oneself against such attack, or to require an
intervening third party to stop the animal from approaching or chasing the
human being or domestic animal in such a terrorizing manner. It shall not
matter whether the human being or domestic animal sustains any physical injury.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for the owner or keeper of a vicious or dangerous
animal to permit the animal to go or be taken off the premises of the owner or
keeper for any reason other than grooming or veterinary care, to be loose upon
the premises of the owner or keeper, or elsewhere at any time. The dog or cat
shall be kept at all times either confined within an enclosure from which it
cannot escape, or firmly secured by means of a collar and chain or other
similar device.
   (C)   Following are duties and responsibilities of animal owners:
      (1)   Responsibility of all animal owners. It shall be the duty of every
owner of any animal, or anyone having an animal in his possession or custody,
to exercise reasonable care and to take all necessary steps and precautions to
protect other people, property, and animals from injuries or damages which
might result from their animal's behavior, regardless of whether such behavior
is motivated by mischievousness, playfulness, or ferocity.
      (2)   Parent or guardian liability. In the event the owner or keeper of
any animal is a minor, the parent or guardian of such minor shall be
responsible to insure that all provisions of this section are complied with.
      (3)   Duty to keep animal under restraint while on owner, possessor, or
custodian's property. It shall be the duty of every owner of any animal, or
anyone having any animal in his possession or custody, to insure that the
animal is kept under restraint and that reasonable care and precautions are
taken to prevent the animal from leaving, while unattended, the real property
limits of its owner, possessor, or custodian, and that it is securely and
humanely enclosed within a house, building, fence, pen, or other enclosure out
of which it cannot climb, dig, jump or otherwise escape on its own volition.
Such enclosure must be securely locked at any time the animal is left
unattended, or it must be securely and humanely restrained by chain, cable, and
trolley, or other tether of sufficient strength to prevent escape, or it must
be on a leash under the control of a competent person,
      (4)   Additional requirements for precautions that must be taken by
owners of vicious or dangerous animals. Whenever outside of its enclosure as
provided herein, but is on the owner's property, a vicious or dangerous animal
must be attended by the owner and restrained by a secure collar and leash of
sufficient strength to prevent its escape. No vicious or dangerous animal shall
be chained, tethered, or otherwise tied to any inanimate object, such as a
tree, post, or building outside of its own enclosure as provided herein. Owners
of vicious or dangerous animals who maintain their animal out of doors, must
have a portion of their property fenced with a perimeter or area fence. Within
this perimeter fence, the vicious or dangerous animal must be humanely confined
inside a pen or kennel of adequate size. The pen or kennel may not share common
fencing with the area or perimeter fence. The kennel or fence must have secure
sides and a secure top attached to all sides. The sides must either be buried
two (2) feet into the ground, sunken into a concrete pad, or securely attached
to a wire bottom. The gate to the kennel must be locked.
      (5)   Duty to keep animal under restraint while off property. It shall be
the duty of the owner of any animal or anyone having an animal in his
possession to keep the animal under restraint and in control at all times while
the animal is off the real property limits of the owner, possessor, or
custodian. For purposes of this section, the animal is deemed under control
when, it is securely confined within a vehicle parked or in motion, or it is
properly confined within a secure enclosure with the permission of the owner of
the property where the enclosure is located, or it is securely restrained by a
leash or other device held by a competent person.
      (6)   Additional requirements that must be taken by owners of vicious or
dangerous animals. Except when being transported in, and securely confined
within, a vehicle, no vicious or dangerous animal shall be permitted off the
property of his owner except when it is attended by its owner, and is
restrained by a secure collar and leash (not to exceed six (6) feet in length),
both collar and leash to be of sufficient strength to prevent escape, and
muzzled by sufficient means to prevent its biting other persons or domestic
animals.
   (D)   The following are enforcement of restrictions on vicious and dangerous
animals:
      (1)   In the event that any law enforcement, code enforcement, or animal
control officer has probable cause to believe that a vicious or dangerous
animal is being harbored in violation of this section, s/he may:
         (a)   Order the violation immediately corrected and issue a citation
to the owner or keeper, or
         (b)   If the violation cannot be immediately corrected and the animal
is posing an imminent serious threat to human beings or other domestic animals,
the animal may be seized and impounded, in which case the owner or keeper will
be issued a citation for the violation, At the owner's request and expense,
such impoundment may be at a veterinarian or licensed kennel of the owner's
choosing and at the owners' expense. If the ultimate disposition of the
citation is that the animal is not vicious or dangerous as defined, it will be
released to the owner. If the ultimate disposition of the citation is vicious
or dangerous as defined, the animal will be released to the owner only after
payment of any fines, fees and penalties, and upon presentation of proof that
the animal will now be kept restrained or confined as specified in this
section.
      (2)   If the owner or keeper of an alleged vicious or dangerous animal
fails to either provide proof that the animal will now be kept restrained or
confined in compliance with the provisions of this section, or fails to reclaim
it after impoundment, and if it cannot be adopted by someone providing proof
that it will be kept restrained or confined as specified in this section, it
may be humanely euthanized.
   (E)   Warning signs. All owners, keepers, or harborers of any guard dog or
vicious or dangerous animal shall display in a prominent place on their
premises, and at each entrance or exit to the area where such animal is
confined, a sign easily readable by the public using the words "Beware of
Vicious and Dangerous Animal" or "Beware of Vicious and Dangerous Dog".
   (F)   Complaints.
      (1)   Any person who has been pursued or attacked by an allegedly vicious
or dangerous animal, or anyone on behalf of such person, may make a complaint
with the City, charging the owner, possessor, or custodian of such animal with
harboring a vicious or dangerous animal. A copy of such complaint shall be
transmitted to the appropriate law enforcement, code enforcement, or animal
control officer for investigation and action. In the event that the law
enforcement, code enforcement, or animal control officer determines that the
facts support the complaint that a vicious or dangerous animal is being
harbored in violation of this section, s/he may proceed according to §
90.17(D), above.
      (2)   If a subsequent complaint is filed against the same owner,
possessor or guardian for an animal previously determined or found to be a
vicious or dangerous animal, and if the ultimate disposition of the subseguent
complaint is that the animal is vicious or dangerous as defined, the final
order shall reguire the owner, possessor, or guardian of that vicious or
dangerous animal to immediately remove the animal from the City or order the
animal humanely euthanized.
   (G)   Other laws and regulations. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to limit or prohibit application of any other public law or governmental
regulation. Further, nothing in this section shall in any manner limit the
civil liability of any owner, possessor, or guardian of any animal to any
aggrieved person for damages.

proof in order to determine whether or not there is reason to believe that the
dog or cat is rabid or mad. The judge, in his discretion, may among other
alternatives have the dog or cat impounded for observation, order the dog or
cat killed. If the owner or keeper of the dog or cat makes a request in writing
to the district judge that the dog or cat be held by some reliable veterinarian
for a proper period of observation, and agrees in writing to pay the charges
therefor, the dog or cat may, at the discretion of the court, be delivered for
observation to the veterinarian who shall be approved by the court. The
veterinarian shall make a report of his findings to the district judge and may
then declare whether or not the dog or cat is rabid or mad. Any dog or cat
judged to be rabid or mad by the district judge shall immediately be destroyed
by the S.P.C.A. or the police in a humane manner if so ordered by the district
judge.

§ 2 APPLICATION AND PERMITS.
   (A)   Road opening permits shall be issued by the City Maintenance
Supervisor in pursuance of a written application filed with him. Application
forms shall be provided by the City Maintenance Supervisor.
   (B)   The application shall give the location and dimensions of the proposed
opening, the purpose for which the opening is to be made, the kind of pavement
or surface to be opened, and the approximate date the opening will be made. The
period of time allowed for closing an opening will be governed by the size and
nature of the opening. If the work is not completed within the time designated
on the permit, the permit may be cancelled, and a cancellation charge of five
dollars ($5.00) applied.
   (C)   If the work has been started but not completed within the time

passed 1-18-01).
§ 3 DEPOSIT OR SECURITY FOR PAYMENT.
   (A)   Restoration of pavement or payment of the cost thereof must be assured
in one of the following ways:
      (1)   The applicant has made a cash deposit equal to the estimated charge
for restoration at current rates.
      (2)   The applicant has opened a running account by making an initial
deposit suitable to the City Maintenance Supervisor, to be replenished by the
applicant voluntarily or upon request by the City Maintenance Supervisor. No
permit shall be issued under this provision unless there is an unencumbered
amount in the applicant's account sufficient to cover the estimated restoration
charge on permit applied for.
      (3)   The applicant is the city department whose functions require the
installation or maintenance of underground structures.
      (4)   The applicant is a corporation whose franchise empowers it to make
its own paving restoration, but such permits will be issued only when the
restoration work keeps fully apace with the openings being made. Such
corporations shall pay promptly all bills for inspection at current rates.
   (B)   If at any time during the course of the work it appears that the cash
deposit is inadequate to cover the cost of restoration, an additional sum shall
be deposited by the permittee in an amount equal to the difference between the
deposit and the revised estimate of charge.
(Ord. 10-83, passed 10-13-83; Am. Ord. 8-94, passed 8-3-94; Am. Ord. 2001-02,
passed 1-18-01).
§ 4 INTERFERENCE WITH VEHICULAR TRAFFIC.
   (A)   The permittee shall carry on the work authorized by the permit in a
manner as to cause a minimum of interference with traffic. He shall provide
adequate warning signs and devices to warn and guide traffic, and shall place
the signs and warning devices in a position of maximum effectiveness.
   (B)   If the City Maintenance Supervisor deems it necessary to have flagmen
because of the hazardous conditions created by the openings, the permittee
shall furnish flagmen at his own expense.
(Ord. 10-83, passed 10-13-83; Am. Ord. 8-94, passed 8-3-94; Am. Ord. 2001-02,

§ 5 RESTRICTED WORKING HOURS.
   (A)   Unless a cut must be made in an "EMERGENCY" situation, Alexandria
streets have restricted working hours from 8:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. Approval is
necessary for any deviation.
(Ord. 10-83, passed 10-13-83; Am. Ord. 8-94, passed 8-3-94; Am. Ord. 2001-02,
passed 1-18-01).
§ 6 TUNNELING, TRENCHING, BACKFILLING, AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Tunneling.
      (1)   All streets are to be bored or tunneled unless otherwise approved
by the City Maintenance Supervisor.
      (2)   Tunneling is often necessary where pipe or conduit passes under
curb, or other underground facilities. The permittee shall not do any tunneling
except by permission of the City Maintenance Supervisor. Where tunneling has
been resorted to, the permittee shall bed the pipe or conduit as specified in
"Backfilling and Restoration" in division (C) below. The remainder of the space
from top of this fill to the roof of the tunnel shall be completely filled with
1:4:8 concrete of suitable consistency, thoroughly tamped to fill the entire
space, and to afford a rigid support for the tunnel roof for its entire area.
The complete backfilling of the tunnel shall be performed to pass the approval
of the City Maintenance Supervisor.
      (3)   In the installation of small service pipes, it is suggested that
the pipe be jacked through or that a hole of sufficient size be bored. In such
cases, charge for inspection and issuance of permit only will be made for that
portion of street over services installed.
   (B)   Trenching.
      (1)   Whenever culverts, sewers, manholes, valve chambers, catch basin
connections, water mains, gas pipe, electric conduits, or house connections
thereto, or any type of subsurface facilities are exposed in excavating, the
permittee shall, at his own expense, protect them from damage.
      (2)   The permittee shall use all necessary precautions to protect
persons or property from injury or damage. Barricades and sufficient warning
lights shall be placed along the opening. Flagmen shall be provided by the
permittee if considered necessary by the City Maintenance Supervisor.
      (3)   The length, width, and location of the trench, also the manner in
which the work is done, shall be under the control of the City Maintenance
Supervisor. Every precaution shall be taken to safeguard the work, and to
inconvenience the public as little as possible.
      (4)   The permittee shall carefully sawcut and remove the paving and base
course materials and store them in piles separated from the excavated earth.
Excavated material shall be placed so as not to obstruct gutters or drains and
is such manner as will cause minimum inconvenience to the public. If necessary,
temporary covers for gutters shall be installed to insure adequate drainage. In
special cases, it may be necessary to haul part or all of the excavated
material from the street.
      (5)   Openings shall be properly sheeted and braced where necessary, to
prevent caving, slipping, or cracking of sides. Sheeting and bracing used to
support the sides of the opening shall be carefully removed as the backfilling
of the trench progresses, but if considered, by the City Maintenance
Supervisor, necessary for the protection of the banks, the sheeting and bracing
shall be cut off two feet below the surface of the subgrade and left in place.
If pavement along the sides of the opening is, or becomes undermined and
unsupported, permittee shall, at his own cost and expense, break down and
remove the undermined pavement and the foundation thereof and shall also remove
loose earth and replace with earth properly compacted or low strength mortar
backfill in the manner provided under "Backfilling and Restoration" in division
(C) below.
   (C)   Backfilling and Restoration.
      (1)   Backfill and restoration of pavement and sod areas shall conform to
the following details.
      (2)   Low-Strength Mortar Backfill Material.
      Description: This work shall consist of the placement of a flowable
mixture of Portland cement, fly ash and sand for backfilling conduits under
public roadways.
      Materials: Materials shall be:
         (a)   Cement   801.01
         (b)   Fly Ash shall meet ASTM C-618
         (c)   Fine aggregate shall be natural sand or sand manufactured from
stone, gravel, or air-cooled slag. The gradation of the sand shall meet the
requirements of 804. The sand shall be fine enough to stay in suspension in the
mixture to the extent required for proper flow. The Engineer reserves the right
to reject the sand if a flowable mixture cannot be produced.
         (d)   Water used for mortar backfill shall be free from oil, acid,
strong alkalies or vegetable matter.
      Mortar Mix Proportioning: The initial trial mixture shall consist of the
following quantities of materials per cubic yard:
                           Class LSM - 50
                  Cement      50 lbs.
                  Fly Ash      250 lbs.
                  Sand         2910 lbs.
                  Water (Target)   500 lbs.
      Adjustments of the proportions may be made by the Engineer providing the
total absolute volume of the materials is maintained.
      Mix Adjustment: The supplier shall make one or more one-cubic yard trial
batches at different water contents to insure a flowable mortar. Mixture is too
dry when cracks develop in the mortar as it flows into place.
      To expedite settlement of the mortar, it will be necessary for bleed
water to appear on the surface immediately after the mortar is struck off. A
delay in bleeding indicates there are too many fines in the mixture, so the fly
ash quantity shall be reduced in increments of 50 lbs. until the mixture is
bleeding freely. Approximately 60 lbs. of sand shall be added to replace each
50-lb. increment of fly ash to maintain the original yield.
      Mixing Mortar: The mortar shall be delivered to the site of the work and
discharge shall be completed within 2.5 hours.
      Placing Mortar: Flowable mortar shall be discharged from the mixer by any
reasonable means in to the space to be filled. The fill material shall be
brought up uniformly to the fill line shown on the plans or as directed by the
Engineer. Placing of material over low-strength mortar backfill may commence as
soon as the surface water is gone or as directed.
      Before placing the flowable mortar as backfill for a Storm Sewer Conduit,
the Contractor shall secure the conduit to prevent it from floating during
placement of the flowable mortar. The Contractor's proposed method of backfill
placement and proposed method of holding the conduit at the plan grade and
flowline elevations should be discussed prior to construction.
      (3)   Excavation Material for Compacted Backfill.
      Any material from excavation of trenches which is desired to be used for
backfill above pipes, which is to be compacted, shall be clean and shall be of
such composition that said material can be compacted to 95 percent relative
density with near optimum water content.

passed 1-18-01).
§ 7 RESPONSIBILITY FOR SETTLEMENT IN RESTORED AREAS.
   (A)   The permittee in accepting and acting under a street opening permit
thereby agrees to assume full responsibility of injury or damage to persons or
property incurred because of any settlement of a restored area, and further
agrees to pay all costs involved in reconditioning such areas.
   (B)   If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of one
year from date of completion of the permanent restoration, it shall be
considered as conclusive evidence of defective backfilling. Any expense
incurred by the city in correcting such settlement shall be paid by the
permittee.

passed 1-18-01).
§ 8 RESPONSIBILITY FOR DUST, DIRT, AND APPEARANCE.
   The permittee shall do everything possible to keep down dust and dirt, and
to keep the appearance of the area surrounding the street opening in good
order. The permittee shall use calcium chloride or equal to keep dust to a
minimum. After the close of each working day, the permittee shall see that the
surrounding area around the opening is swept up, and as clean as possible. At
no time will it be permissible to leave piles of excavated dirt in the street
or sidewalk. If necessary, the area will be washed with water. The permittee
shall do whatever the City Maintenance Supervisor deems necessary to clean up
the area.

passed 1-18-01).
§ 9 NEW ROADS.
   No new street shall be opened except with permission of the City Maintenance
Supervisor, and then only in emergency cases, such as a broken sewer line,
water line, or the like. This shall be for a period of three weeks. Permittee
may be required, if the City Maintenance Supervisor sees fit, to pave the
entire street with a one-inch course, with length of paving up to the
discretion of the City Maintenance Supervisor.

§ 10 INSPECTION.
   The inspection fee to be paid by the permittee will be twenty dollars
($20.00) per hour, with a minimum charge of twenty dollars ($20.00). This shall
be paid promptly after inspection of restoration and billing to the permittee
by the City Maintenance Supervisor.

§ 92.04 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of the authorized city official to serve or cause
to be served a notice upon the owner or occupant of any premises on which there
is kept or maintained any nuisance in violation of the provisions of this
chapter and to demand the abatement of the nuisance within the time specified
unless the nuisance constitutes an immediate danger to the health and well-
being of the community. If such danger is present, the nuisance may be abated
immediately by the city. Notice shall be deemed proper if mailed to the last
known address of the owner of the premises and if posted in a conspicuous place
on the premises affected by the notice.
   (B)   If the person so served does not abate the nuisance within five days,
or sooner if the nuisance constitutes an immediate danger to the health and
well being of the community, the city is hereby empowered to enter upon the
private property to abate the nuisance, keeping an account of the expense,
including, but not limited to, the labor and materials, of the abatement, and
the expense shall be charged to and paid by the owner or occupant.
   (C)   Charges for nuisance abatement shall be a lien upon the premises.
Whenever a bill for charges remains unpaid for ten (10) days after it has been
rendered, the City Clerk may file with the County Clerk an affidavit of the
responsible officer, which shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount
of the lien, and the regularity of the proceedings pursuant to this chapter and
KRS 65.8840. The lien shall be notice to all persons from the time of its
recording and shall bear interest thereafter until paid. Notice of the lien
claim shall be mailed to the last known address of the owner of the premises
and shall be posted in a conspicuous place on said premises. However, failure
to record the lien claim or to mail the notice, or the failure of the owner to
receive the notice, shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for
charges as provided in division (D) below.
   (D)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid nuisance abatement charges shall
be sold for nonpayment and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the
charges after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory
liens. This foreclosure shall be in equity in the name of the city. In addition
to the abovementioned remedy or any other remedy authorized by law, the owner
of a property upon which a lien has been attached pursuant to this section
shall be personally liable for the amount of the lien, including all interest,
civil penalties, and other charges and the city may bring a civil action
against the owner and shall have the same remedies as provided for the recovery
of a debt owed.
   (E)   The City Attorney is authorized and directed to institute such
proceedings, in the name of the city, in any court having jurisdiction over the
matter, against any property and/or property owner for which the bill has
remained unpaid sixty (60) days after it has been rendered.
   (F)   In the alternative to the abatement procedure described in this
section, any police officer, the Building Inspector, the Zoning Administrator
or other responsible officer designated by the Mayor may issue a written notice
of violation of a nuisance which is a violation of §
92.02 or
92.03. If the person receiving the notice of violation does not abate the
nuisance within five (5) days, a citation may be issued citing the person to
appear in the County District Court for a violation of the specified provisions
involved, or this section shall be enforced as provided in §
92.99, which provides for a mail-in ticket procedure. The amount of the fine
shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for the first offense, and fifty dollars
($50.00) for each subsequent offense, if paid within five (5) working days of
the date on which the citation is received, provided that such fine shall be
fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first offense, and one hundred dollars ($100.00)
for each subsequent offense, if not timely paid within such five working days.

nuisance be created or contributed to by the owner, occupant, or person having
control or management of the premises, but merely that the nuisance be created
or contributed to by licensees, invitees, guests, or other persons for whose
conduct the owner or operator is responsible, or by persons for whose conduct
the owner or operator is not responsible, but by the exercise of reasonable
care ought to have become aware of.

§ 92.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   In arriving at realistic penalties for violations of provisions
contained in this chapter, the primary objective has been to establish them as
part of the simplest possible enforcement system. The system had these
features.
      (1)   A mail-in ticket which:
         (a)   Identifies the violator.
         (b)   Lists and identifies violations of the code provisions by
section numbers.
         (c)   States the prescribed fine beside each violation listed.
         (d)   Provides simple instructions on where the ticket is to be mailed
with a check or money order in the amount of the stipulated fine.
         (e)   States a simple procedure to follow if the violator elects to
appear in court to plead his case rather than mail in the fine.
      (2)   Use of the above ticket by all department and city personnel
authorized to enforce the sections of this chapter.
      (3)   Use for particularly flagrant violations (those nuisances which are
dangerous or unhealthful or which are detrimental to the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens and visitors of the city). This would be in the form of
a direct summons to the court, with penalty range substantially above those on
the mail-in ticket.
   (B)   Fines.
      (1)   The schedule of penalties for violations of this chapter is as
follows:
         (a)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of §§
92.02 or
92.03 shall be guilty of an offense and shall be punished by a fine of twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) for the first offense, and fifty dollars ($50.00) for
each subsequent offense.
         (b)   The fine provided in division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be
double if not paid within five (5) business days after the issuance of a
citation. If the fine is not paid within ten (10) business days after the
issuance of a citation, the violator may be cited to appear before the Campbell
District Court and all court costs shall be borne by the violator in addition
to any fine imposed by the court.
         (c)   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter and is found
guilty in District Court shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined
not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred dollars
($500.00) for each offense. Each day’s continued violation shall constitute a
separate offense.
   (C)   Any creditor that fails to register vacant residential property with
the city shall be subject to a civil fine of $100 payable to the city for each
day of delinquency.

   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, gross receipts
shall be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the gross receipts by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the gross receipts by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) of this section; and
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (A) through (E) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the city.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenue, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will
fairly represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of gross receipts.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage that the compensation
for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to the total
wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to verify the
accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this subsection, the
taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
"passed through" these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

withheld shall be paid to the city in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter ending
thereafter, on or before the end of the month following the close of each
quarter, make a return and report to the city, and pay to the city, the tax
required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or
required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the city.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any sums
required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to be
withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational

a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the city, shall be submitted.
   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or before
January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee
for payment to the city during the preceding calendar year.
   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to

severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
section unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for, or
pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes imposed by
this chapter become or became due.
   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H) of this section, every employee
receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
117.03 of this chapter shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all
cases where the employer does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter
from the employee, such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing
with the city each quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer or
as otherwise required by the city. If an employer fails to or is not required
to withhold, report, or pay the license tax it shall become the duty of the
employee to file with the city. The only employer that is not required to
withhold, report, and pay the occupational license tax is the Federal
Government including the United States Postal Service. The payment required to
be made by an employee can be made quarterly, for the periods ending March 31,
June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, or at any time the employee
wishes to make an estimated payment for the year in which wages are earned. All
license fees must be received by February 28 for the preceding calendar year,
together with a copy of the employee’s W-2 form. Employers not required to

preceding calendar year, giving the amount of salaries, wages, commissions or
other compensation earned during such preceding year by each such employee.
This list shall include all current full-time employees, part-time employees,
temporary employees, and terminated employees whether it be voluntary or
involuntary.

with a license renewal application:
            1.   Information regarding any change in ownership, or any
initiated, pending, or concluded investigation or proceeding, during the period
of the initial license or prior renewal period, by any governmental or
administrative agency, including an investigation or proceeding involving
theft, loss, or possible diversion of medicinal cannabis by the licensee or
from the licensee's facility;
            2.   Information regarding the licensee's ability to continue with
licensed activities, including any staffing issues, delays, medicinal cannabis
shortages, medicinal cannabis product recalls, location issues, and financial
issues that occurred since the license was issued; and
            3.   The licensee's history of compliance with KRS Chapter 218B and
915 KAR Chapter 1, including a summary of any noncompliance and corrective
action taken during the current and any previous licensing period or a
statement indicating that the licensee has not violated KRS Chapter 218B or 915
KAR Chapter 1 as of the date the renewal application is submitted.
         (g)   The city shall acknowledge receipt of a renewal license
application within fifteen (15) calendar days of submission by the applicant.
The city shall review each application to determine whether the application is
complete. If the city determines an application is not complete, the city shall
provide written notice to the applicant of the identified deficiencies in the
application. The applicant shall have ten (10) calendar days from the date of
the deficiency notification to cure the identified deficiencies and provide any
missing information or documentation to the city in the manner prescribed by
the city. If the applicant fails to cure any deficiency within ten (10)
calendar days from the date of the deficiency notification, the city shall
reject the application as incomplete.
         (h)   If the city determines that a license renewal application is
lacking sufficient information upon which to make a renewal determination, the
city shall notify the licensee in writing of the factors that require
additional information and documentation. The licensee shall have ten (10)
calendar days from the date of the notice to provide the requested information
and documentation to the city. A licensee's failure to provide the requested
information to the city by the deadline shall be grounds for denial of the
license renewal application.

facilities and records to assist with determining continuing compliance with
KRS Chapter 218B and 915 KAR Chapter 1.

upon expiration if the licensee has not filed a license renewal application and
paid the required renewal fee in accordance with this administrative
regulation. If a licensee properly submits a timely renewal application with
applicable renewal fee, the city may extend its existing license from the date
the existing license expires until the city can complete its renewal
application review and issue a determination.

City Council shall exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, unduly
repetitious, or excludable on constitutional or statutory grounds or on the
basis of evidentiary privilege recognized in the courts of this Commonwealth.
Hearsay evidence may be admissible, if it is the type of evidence that
reasonable and prudent persons would rely on in their daily affairs, but it
shall not be sufficient in itself to support findings unless it would be
admissible over objections in a civil court of law.
      (2)   All testimony shall be made under oath or affirmation. Any part of
the evidence may be received in written form if doing so will expedite the
hearing without substantial prejudice to the interests of any party.

by law. The city may prepare a transcript of a hearing or a portion of a
hearing upon request but the party making the request shall be responsible for
the transcription costs. The form of all requests and fees charged shall be
consistent with KRS 61.870 to 61.884.

ex-officio police officers; or any other law enforcement officers from
discharging, while on duty, such weapons as shall be necessary in the proper
discharge of their duty.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful to discharge any air-gun or air-pistol, “BB” gun
or pistol, or air rifle or air pistol, whether gas-operated or spring gun, or
any instrument, toy, or weapon, commonly known as a pea shooter, sling shot, or
bow made for the purpose of throwing or projecting missiles of any kind or by
any means whatsoever, whether such instrument is called by any name set forth
above or by any other name, unless the discharge of the instrument described
above is done on private property and the projectiles from the instrument do
not go beyond the property line of the private property, all within the city
limits.
   (D)   Any police officer of the city, or any other police officer with

controlled substance.
      (3)   It is unlawful for any person to place in any newspaper, magazine,

or intended for use as drug paraphernalia.
(KRS 218A.500(2) – (4))
   (C)   Factors to be considered in determining whether an object is drug

division (B) above; the innocence of an owner or of anyone in control of the
object, as to a direct violation of division (B) above shall not prevent a
finding that the object is intended for use or designed for use as drug
paraphernalia;
      (7)   Instructions, oral or written, provided with the object concerning
its use;
      (8)   Descriptive materials accompanying the object which explain or

legitimate supplier of like or related items to the community, such as a
licensed distributor or dealer of tobacco products;
      (12)   Direct or circumstantial evidence of the ratio of sales of the
object to the total sales of the business enterprise;
      (13)   The existence and scope of legitimate uses for the object in the

vehicle, a peace officer may inquire as to the presence of needles or other
sharp objects in the areas to be searched that may cut or puncture the officer
and offer to not charge a person with possession of drug paraphernalia if the
person declares to the officer the presence of the needle or other sharp
object. If, in response to the offer, the person admits to the presence of the
needle or other sharp object prior to the search, the person shall not be
charged with or prosecuted for possession of drug paraphernalia for the needle
or sharp object or for possession of a controlled substance for residual or
trace drug amounts present on the needle or sharp object.
      (2)   The exemption under this division (E) shall not apply to any other
drug paraphernalia that may be present and found during the search or to
controlled substances present in other than residual or trace amounts.

required thereunder. The officer shall take the minor to the city police
headquarters where the name of the minor’s parent, guardian, or person having
legal custody of him shall be ascertained, or if the child is committed, the
Department of Juvenile Justice or the cabinet, as appropriate, and if the
parent is not available, then a relative, guardian, or person exercising
custodial control or supervision of the child, that the child has been taken
into custody, give an account of specific charges against the child, including
the provisions of this section alleged to have been violated, and the reasons

taken into the custody, the investigating officer shall follow the requirements
set forth in KRS Chapter 610 and other applicable provisions of the Kentucky
Unified Juvenile Code, regarding detention or release of the child.
      (3)   Unless the nature of the offense or other circumstances are such as
to indicate the necessity of keeping the child in secure custody, the officer

subject to the procedures and penalties provided for by the Kentucky Unified

railroad right-of-way meet the requirements of those sections of state statue
which regulates such uses.
§ 3.7 EXCAVATION, MOVEMENT OF SOIL, TREE REMOVAL AND EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION
CONTROL.
   (A)   No use, building or structure shall be conducted or constructed in
such a way to cause hazard to the occupants or users of any facility or to
other wise create hazards or degradation of the natural environment in areas of
steep slopes and susceptibility to erosion. On no property shall anyone strip
vegetation, grade land or erect a building or a structure for other than
agricultural purposes.
   (B)   On no property shall anyone, an entity or a governmental entity strip,
excavate, fill or otherwise move soil, trees or other vegetation for sale, or
any other purpose, except for minor changes such as the filling of small
pockets in lots, removal of vegetation which is diseased or endangering the
public safety, flower beds and other similar operations, in any zone set forth
in this ordinance without first ensuring that all requirements of Article 10 of
this ordinance and the subdivision regulations of the city, if applicable, have
been fulfilled and then obtaining a permit from the Building Inspector for such
stripping, excavation, filling or other means of soil movement including
wholesale removal of trees and other vegetation.
   (C)   The developer for a proposed development shall be required to submit
to the Planning Commission a detailed plan for erosion and/or sedimentation
control. The plan shall contain proposed methods for slope stabilization,
erosion control and water pollution abatement and shall be reviewed by the
Planning Commission. The Commission shall require that such a plan or part
thereof be submitted with or prior thereto the site plan.
      (1)   No site plan may be approved where the site has been graded,
stripped, excavated, de-vegetated or otherwise disturbed so that slipping,
erosion and/or water pollution has or may reasonably be expected to occur until
such conditions are corrected to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector.
      (2)   The current “Soil Survey of Boone, Campbell and Kenton Counties,
Kentucky”, issued by the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service, in cooperation with the Kentucky Agricultural
Experimental Station, is hereby made a part of these regulations and will be
used for informational and reference purposes.
      (3)   The Building Inspector may issue the required permit only after
being informed by letter from the City Engineer that the resulting change of
grade or removal of trees and other vegetation in the affected area will not be
against the best interests of the local area. The provisions of this section
shall not be construed to prohibit normal excavation or grading incidental to
the construction or alteration of a building on the premises for which a
building permit has been granted as required otherwise in this ordinance, but
shall include all road cuts thereto.
      (4)   Until street, sewers, utilities and appurtenances thereto, and
other public improvements are 100% complete and 51% of the lots in a
subdivision have been sold, the subdivider shall take such measures as are
necessary to prevent erosion of graded surfaces, and to prevent the deposit of
soil and debris from graded surfaces onto public streets, into drainage
channels or sewers or onto adjoining land.
      (5)   Failure to comply with regulations of this section shall result in
a written and/or oral notification by the Building Inspector to the subdivider.
The subdivider shall then be responsible for the clean up of all ground
occupied or affected by non-compliance, as distinguished by the Building
Inspector, within 24 hours or be subject to a fine and/or the costs incurred
for clean up by the city.
      (6)   Commonly accepted good practice for erosion and sediment control
include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   All slopes and graded areas are to be seeded as soon as
practical after the grading operation has been completed and/or building
development has been finished;
         (b)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one
time during development, consistent with the developer’s capability to complete
restoration work;
         (c)   Where necessary, temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be
used to protect critical areas exposed during development and areas that cannot
be restored to final condition;
         (d)   Sediment basins (debris basins or silt traps) shall be installed
and maintained until ground cover has been completed to remove sediment from
runoff waters from land undergoing development;
         (e)   On-site provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the
increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development. Drainage swales, silt checks, temporary retention dams and the
like are to be used during the grading operation;
         (f)   Permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as
soon as practical in the development and/or according to development schedule;
         (g)   The site plan shall be compatible with the topography and soils
so as to create the least erosion potential;
         (h)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained and
protected; and
         (i)   Maintain existing drainage in the pre-development condition and
allow storm water drainage from areas upstream to flow around or through the
development by protected channels or pipes.
      (7)   The owner of lots, and any builder of homes thereon, are to adhere
to the requirements of this section relating to erosion and sedimentation
control.
§ 3.8 DEFERRED EXTERIOR MAINTENANCE.
   No rubbish, salvage materials, junk or miscellaneous refuse shall be openly
stored or kept in the open and weeds shall not be allowed to go uncut within
any zones when the same may be construed to be a menace to the public health
and safety by the appropriate health department, or have a depressing influence
upon property values in the neighborhood, in the opinion of the Zoning
Administrator. Grass and weeds above eight inches in height shall be considered
a nuisance under this regulation. In no case shall the use of inoperable
vehicles, buses, mobile homes, trailers and the like constitute enclosure of
refuse materials, as defined in Article 2 of this ordinance. All exterior
dumpsters and garbage or rubbish containers shall be screened by an opaque
fence, landscaping, earthen berm or other suitable opaque enclosure. The
average height of the enclosure shall be two feet more than the height of the
container, but shall not be required to exceed eight feet in height.
§ 3.9 AUTOMOBILE WRECKING, SALVAGE AND JUNKYARD LOCATIONS.
   In consideration of the environmental consequences and potential impacts
upon adjacent properties, automotive wrecking, salvage and junkyards shall only
be permitted as a conditional use (in districts as specified in this ordinance)
and where authorization is obtained (when appropriate) from the Kentucky
Transportation Cabinet, Department of Highways, in accordance with KRS 177.905
to 177.950. Any salvage materials in open storage or junkyards existing at the
time of adoption of this ordinance shall comply fully with these regulations.
Failure to do so will constitute a violation punishable as prescribed by this
ordinance. Any permitted automobile wrecking, salvage or junkyard operation
shall adhere to the following guidelines.
   (A)   No person shall operate any junkyard which is situated closer than
2,000 feet from the centerline of any county, state, federal or limited access
highway or turnpike, including bridges and bridge approaches unless a permit

damage exceeds 50% of the market value of such structure in which the non-
conforming use is operated and a determination is made by the Board of
Adjustment that this structure should not be reconstructed;
         (e)   Whenever the structure, in which the non-conforming use is
operated, becomes obsolete or substandard under any applicable ordinance of the
city and the cost of placing such structure in lawful compliance with the
applicable ordinance exceeds 50% of the market value of such structure as of
the date of the official order under the applicable ordinance;
         (f)   Whenever said non-conforming use becomes illegal, a nuisance or
a hazard to the public’s health, safety or general welfare; and
         (g)   Whenever said non-conforming use becomes the property of the
city, the commonwealth or any other governmental entity.
   (C)   Non-conforming structures.

the non-conforming activity ceases to operate and/or the premises are vacated
so as to leave the property unoccupied for a period of at least 12 consecutive
calendar months;
         (c)   Whenever the non-conforming structure is damaged in any manner
whatsoever the cost of repairing such damage exceeds 50% of the market value of
such structure in which the non-conforming use is operated and a determination
is made by the Board of Adjustment that this structure should not be
reconstructed;
         (d)   Whenever the non-conforming structure becomes obsolete or
substandard under any applicable ordinance of the city and the cost of placing
such structure in lawful compliance with the applicable ordinance exceeds 50%
of the market value of such structure as of the date of the official order
under the applicable ordinance;
         (e)   Whenever said non-conforming structure becomes a nuisance, or a
hazard to the public’s health, safety or general welfare; and
         (f)   Whenever the city, commonwealth or any other governmental entity
acquires title to said non-conforming structure or the land upon which it is
located.

of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing; provided that, the cubic
content of the building, as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of
this ordinance which rendered it non-conforming, shall not be increased.
Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring, to a safe condition, of any building, structure or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, except for the conditions as stated in divisions (B)(3) or (C)(2)
above.
   (E)   Non-conforming signs.
      (1)   Continuance. Except as herein provided, any lawful non-conforming

         (c)   A site plan, as regulated by the applicable requirements of §
3.21 of this ordinance, including the proposed area and yard requirements for
the development, is submitted for review and approval by the Planning
Commission.
      (2)   In addition, the Planning Commission may waive the requirement that
all lots abut a minimum frontage along a dedicated right-of-way provided that
those lots that do not abut a dedicated right-of-way are assured an
unencumbered and maintained accessway by the association to a dedicated right-
of-way in accordance with division (C)(1)(b) above.
   (D)   Request for variances for subdivisions. An applicant for approval of a
subdivision plat may elect to have the Planning Commission hear any requests
for variances proposed in the development. The request for the Planning
Commission to consider the variance and the application for the variance shall
be submitted at the time of filing the preliminary subdivision plat. In such
cases, the Planning Commission is hereby empowered to hear and finally decide
applications for variances pursuant to KRS 100.281(6). The Planning Commission
in such circumstances shall assume all powers and duties otherwise exercised by
the Board of Adjustment, pursuant to KRS 100.281(7) and Article 15 of this
ordinance. The application for a variance shall be considered at the same
public hearing set for the subdivision.
§ 3.15 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Determination. Subject to the requirements of § 15.7, the Board of
Adjustment may authorize a conditional use to be located within any zone in
which the particular conditional use is permitted by the use regulations of
this ordinance, if the evidence presented by the applicant is such as to
establish by clear and convincing evidence:
      (1)   The proposed building and use at the particular location is
necessary or desirable to provide a service or facility which will contribute
to the general well-being of the neighborhood or the community;
      (2)   Such building and use will not, under the circumstances of the
particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of
persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to property or
improvements in the vicinity; and
      (3)   The proposed building and use will comply with any regulations and
conditions specified in this ordinance for such building and use.
   (B)   Conditional use permits. In accordance with KRS 100.237, the Board of
Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide applications for conditional
use permits to allow the proper integration into the community of uses which
are specifically named herein which may be suitable only in specific locations
in the zone only if certain conditions are met.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment may approve, modify or deny any application
for a conditional use permit. If it approves such permit, it may attach
necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more
things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a
continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board of
Adjustment’s minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference
to the specific section in the zoning regulation listing the conditional use
under consideration. In addition, said conditional use permit shall be recorded
in the office of the County Clerk and one copy of said permit attached to the
deed for the property for which it is issued. The Board of Adjustment shall
have the power to revoke conditional use permits, or variances for non-
compliance with the condition thereof. Furthermore, the Board of Adjustment
shall have a right of action to compel offending structures or uses removed at
the cost of the violator and may have judgment in personam for such cost.
      (2)   Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant
from complying with all of the requirements of this ordinance, the Building
Code, Housing Code and other regulations of the city.
      (3)   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within the time limit set by the Board of Adjustment or within 12 consecutive
calendar months from date of issuance, such conditional use permit shall not
revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing.
EXERCISED, as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for
the construction of the main building or other improvement has been let; or in
the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is under
construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving
substantial investment shall be under contract, in development or completed.
When construction is not a part of the use, EXERCISED shall mean that the use
is in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.
      (4)   (a)   The Zoning Administrator shall review all conditional use
permits, except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied,
at least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or
structure where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the
landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the
conditional use permit.
         (b)   If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions
listed on the conditional use permit, the Zoning Administrator shall report the
fact in writing to the Chairperson of the Board of Adjustment. The report shall
state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the
conditions on the conditional use permit, and a copy of the report shall be
furnished to the landowner at the same time that it is furnished to the
Chairperson of the Board of Adjustment.
         (c)   The Board of Adjustment shall hold a hearing on the report
within a reasonable period of time, and notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one week prior to the
hearing. If the Board of Adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the report
of the Zoning Administrator are true and that the landowner has taken no steps
to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the hearing,
the Board of Adjustment may authorize the Zoning Administrator to revoke the
conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause the
termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit
authorizes.
      (5)   Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional use permit
and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely
and permanently satisfied, the Zoning Administrator, upon request of the
applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions
have been satisfied and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions have
been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of copy of the conditional use
permit which is on file with the County Clerk, as required in KRS 100.237.
Thereafter, said use, if it continues to meet the other requirements of this
ordinance, will be treated as a permitted use.
      (6)   (a)   When an application is made for a conditional use permit for
land located within or abutting any residential zoning district, written notice
shall be given at least 14 days in advance of the public hearing on the
application to the applicant, and owners of every parcel of property adjoining
the property to which the application applies. Written notice shall be by first
class mail with certification by the Board of Adjustment’s Secretary that the
notice was mailed. It shall be the duty of the applicant to furnish to the
Board of Adjustment the name and address of an owner of each parcel of property
as described in this section. Records maintained by the Property Valuation
Administrator may be relied upon conclusively to determine the identity and
address of said owner.
         (b)   In the event such property is in condominium or cooperative
forms of ownership, then the person notified by mail shall be the president or
chairperson of the owner group which administers property commonly owned by the
condominium or cooperative owners.
         (c)   A joint notice may be mailed to two or more co-owners of an
adjoining property who are listed in the Property Valuation Administrator’s
records as having the same address.
§ 3.16 BUILDING REGULATIONS AND PUBLIC WATER AND SANITARY SEWER SERVICE.
   (A)   Building regulations. All structures shall be designed, erected or
altered in accordance with the city’s housing and building codes and the
following regulations.
      (1)   Where two or more structures share a common wall said common wall
shall not be altered in any manner which would provide access through said
common wall from one structure to another. This shall include any type of
opening through said common wall until all requirements of the subdivision
regulations of the city have been met and approval has been granted by the
Planning Commission and the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   Where two structures are separate and remote, said structures shall
not be joined or combined until all requirements of the subdivision regulations
of the city have been met and approval has been granted by the Planning
Commission and Board of Adjustment.
   (B)   Water and sanitary sewer service.
      (1)   No building may be constructed in any zone, except the R-RE Zone
unless such building is connected to a public water and central sanitary sewer
system of adequate capacity and design, and approved by the proper authorities.
      (2)   In the case of the R-RE Zone, existing final platted lots in
already approved subdivisions in all R-1 Zones, private sewage treatment
facilities which provide a minimum of secondary treatment, and have a
subsurface discharge of effluent may be permitted, provided they are approved
in accordance with the requirements of the Northern Kentucky District
Independent Health Department. Private sewage treatment facilities may be
permitted if the Planning Commission determines that there are unique
circumstances which make it unreasonable to tie into a centralized sewer
system.
      (3)   Where existing buildings are presently unserved by a public
sanitary sewer system and are located within a reasonable distance of an
existing or newly extended sanitary sewer line, as determined by the Sanitation
District No. 1 of Northern Kentucky, said building shall be required to connect
with the public sanitary sewer system and the private sewage disposal system
shall be prohibited.
§ 3.17 MOVE AND SET.
   (A)   Requirements. No building, structure, or improvement shall be moved or
set from or upon land located in any area or transported upon any public
street, road, or highway in the city until and unless both a building permit to
move and set, and a transport permit has been obtained therefor, and said
building, structure or improvement complies with the provisions of this
section.
   (B)   Compliance. All buildings, structures and improvements shall comply
with the city’s Housing and Building Code, and all other applicable codes and
regulations.
   (C)   Procedure, permits. The applicant shall submit to the Building
Inspector, the following:
      (1)   An application for a building permit requesting an inspection of
the building, structure or improvement to be moved of set;
      (2)   A plot plan, footing and foundation plan, and construction plans
for any new construction;
      (3)   A statement from the city ensuring that all past and current taxes
have been paid;
      (4)   Upon receipt of the foregoing items, the Building Inspector shall
inspect said building, structure or improvements, and the proposed location
where same will be set within the city and determine that the proposed
development will comply with all the applicable codes and regulations;
      (5)   The move and set shall be referred to the Zoning Administrator for
approval or denial of compliance with this ordinance;
      (6)   Upon approval by the Zoning Administrator and Building Inspector, a
building permit to move and set shall be issued. The City Engineer shall then
be notified of same and shall issue a transport permit. The City Engineer or
his or her agent will designate the route to be traveled. The transport permit
will not be issued if 90 consecutive calendar days or more have lapsed from the
date of inspection by the Building Inspector. The transport permit provided for
in this section shall not be in lieu of any building permit which may be
required by the city; and
      (7)   No transport or building permit to move and set shall be issued
until the applicant has first obtained the necessary permits from the telephone
company, public utilities companies, railroad companies and the Kentucky
Transportation Cabinet and the Campbell County Road Supervisor, unless it can
be shown by the applicant that these agencies are not interested in the matter.
   (D)   Fees.
      (1)   There will be a building inspection fee, as established by the
city, to cover the costs of inspection for determining the structural soundness
of buildings, structures or improvements to be moved, the fee is payable in
advance and must accompany the application provided herein. This fee is not
returnable. If any alterations or improvements to be made are found to be in
compliance with the Building Code and this ordinance, a building permit to move
and set will be issued and the fee will be based on the cost of new foundations
and all work necessary to place the building or structure in its completed
condition in the new location.
      (2)   No person, corporation or company shall transport, move or set any
building, structure or improvement in the city, until and unless such person,
corporation or company shall post with the Building Inspector a good and
sufficient indemnity bond in favor of the city, which indemnity bond shall be
set in an amount which shall cover the cost of any damage or claim to damage to
public improvements (e.g., street pavement, curb and gutter, catch basins,
sewers and the like) and other damage to private property resulting from the
move and set which indemnity bond shall be in the minimum amount as established
by the city, or its appointed zoning body. Such bond shall be made by certified
check, cash or equivalent, or by a surety corporation authorized to do business
in the commonwealth; said bond may be issued on an annual basis, but shall not
be in excess of such period of time.
§ 3.18 SCREENING AREA.
   Screening areas shall be provided for the purpose of minimizing the friction
between incompatible land uses and improving the aesthetic and functional
quality of new development. All screening areas shall be approved and inspected
by the Zoning Administrator (or Planning Commission, where required by this
ordinance) for compliance with a submitted development or site plan as
regulated by the applicable requirements of §§
3.20 and
3.21 of this ordinance.

§ 3.28 HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section is designed to ensure, when development is
proposed in those areas in the city, which have distinctive and special
environmental characteristics which are of significant value to the public and
which make these properties susceptible to damage through improper development.
It is the purpose of these regulations to encourage and guide development that
will preserve existing hillsides and their character through:
      (1)   Innovative approaches to the development of housing units and other
projects in hillside areas, encouraging the use of community unit planning
concepts;
      (2)   Prevention of damage or destruction of trees, shrubbery and other
ground cover, where possible, to prevent loss of their stabilizing influence in
areas where soils are, or likely to become, unstable and prone to landslides;
      (3)   Prevention of land from becoming unstable or prone to landslides
through improper development;
      (4)   Prevention of the loss or damage to mature trees and other
vegetation, significant scenic views and other similar natural features which
are necessary to preserve the aesthetic and visual integrity of the hillsides;
and
      (5)   Prevention of soil erosion and stream siltation caused by improper
development.
   (B)   General requirements. Areas of land on which development is physically
restricted due to excessive hillside slopes shall be limited according to the
following requirements, notwithstanding any other section of this of any other
ordinance adopted by the city.
      (1)   Those properties or areas of land which lie totally or partially
within land areas identified in the comprehensive plan for the city, as
“physically restrictive development areas”;
      (2)   Any other areas which have slopes equal to 20% or greater;
      (3)   Certain soil and bedrock conditions which exhibit characteristics
of moderate environmental concern of construction activity such as, but not
limited to, exposures of the Kope geological formation;
      (4)   Hillsides which support a substantial natural wooded cover; or
      (5)   Land area that has known experience of landslides.
   (C)   Development standards.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful to locate, extend, convert or structurally
alter any structure or otherwise develop any land, including, but not limited,
the excavation, removal or placement of any soil within those areas defined in
division (B) above, unless such development meets the applicable standards set
forth in this section.
      (2)   The registered professional engineer or landscape architect, in
developing the design of any proposed development, shall do so with
consideration of the following standards and guidelines. These standards and
guidelines shall be considered as minimum standards, and the professional
engineer or landscape architect may enact greater standards in order to comply
with the intent of this section. When restrictions of land development occur
within these standards appear to conflict with other associated standards, the
most strict standard shall apply.
         (a)   Identification of landslide-prone areas. All on-site areas which
are vulnerable to landslide damage shall be identified. The risk to off-site
property shall then be minimized by locating development away from areas which
are vulnerable to sliding.
         (b)   Clearance activities standards.
            1.   In all areas, trees and natural vegetation shall be retained,
where feasible, in order to minimize erosion, sedimentation and the disruption
of views to and from hillsides.
            2.   The natural redevelopment condition of the crest of the slope
shall be maintained by tree planting and other landscape measures.
            3.   The natural slope line of the hill as seen in profile shall be
retained, except in areas of approved excavation. Vegetation lines which convey
this slope line shall be maintained, restored and supplemented.
            4.   Earth disturbing activities shall be limited to only those
areas involved in the construction activities. Any grading performed shall be
in keeping with generally accepted engineering and soil conservation practices
to avoid erosion and land sliding and to minimize the effect on the
environment. The smallest practical areas of land should be exposed at any one
time during development and length of exposure should be kept to the shortest
practice amount of time.
            5.   Trees around the perimeter of the construction shall be
protected to prevent root, trunk and branch injury or dismemberment.
            6.   No tree larger than eight inches in diameter, measured 24
inches above the ground, may be destroyed or removed unless specifically
approved during the permit process.
            7.   All areas of land exposed during construction shall be
temporarily revegetated and restored as soon as possible to blend with the
surrounding terrain. All excavations shall have stable side slopes and be
constructed so that revegetation can occur readily.
         (c)   Development restrictions on drainage areas. No more than 50% of
any area of a proposed development may be developed when such area conveys
storm water runoff from surrounding land, either as a natural flow or as a
result of existing land alterations, to a watercourse.
         (d)   Building construction standards.
            1.   Any building shall be designed and located so as to relate to
the natural slope and contours of the land and to minimize grading, excavation
and placement of fill.
            2.   No building constructed between the toe and crest of a slope
within the areas defined in division (B) above, should be higher than two
stories or 35 feet, whichever is less, as measured from the highest point where
the building meets the natural slope.
            3.   Any building located within the areas defined in division (B)
above shall be required to have geotechnically and structurally engineered
foundations, as evidenced by certifications on the building plans by a
registered professional engineer and a registered professional geotechnical
engineer.
            4.   Buildings placed on columns or stilts for structural reasons
shall have space below the buildings screened from view by earth mounding or
vegetation. Supports for decks shall be screened by vegetation.
         (e)   Parking area standards. Parking areas, whenever possible, shall
be located within structures to limit the amount of paved land.
         (f)   Pavement limitations. Paved areas intended for vehicular use
shall be designed to follow the natural contours of the land and provide the
least disruption to the hillside environment.
         (g)   Retaining wall standards.
            1.   Retaining walls shall be no higher than six feet high above
the ground at the base of the wall. Walls may be built in a series of smaller
walls to minimize the visual impact of a higher wall; provided that, the series
of walls can be built without excessive removal of vegetation during
construction.
            2.   All retaining walls shall be properly engineered, backfilled
and maintained.
            3.   Retaining walls shall be faced with stone, textured block,
textured concrete or other textured material that will blend with the hillside.
Medium earth tone colors shall be encouraged. Highly reflective surface
materials are prohibited.
            4.   All retaining walls shall be covered with a minimum of 50%
coverage by vegetation by:
               a.   Planting at the base of the wall;
               b.   Planting within the wall;
               c.   Plants hanging from the top of the wall; and
               d.   Any combination of divisions (C)(2)(g)1. through (C)(2)
(g)4. above.
         (h)   Screening requirements. Visual prominence of a development shall
be minimized by using tree clusters or depressions for view screens. Where
total screening is impractical or undesirable, partial screening should be
employed to at least lessen the full visual impact of the development by
breaking up the horizontal lines of long structures and/or reducing the
apparent height of buildings or walls. See §
3.18 of this ordinance for screening standards.
         (i)   Lighting standards. Unobtrusive forms of lighting shall be
employed for exterior areas (e.g., light where the light source itself is
screened from direct view or low garden type lighting). See § 5.0(O)(2) of this
ordinance for lighting standards.
         (j)   Excavation and fill standards.
            1.   The toes and crests of excavations and their slopes shall be
set back from property boundaries and structures as far as necessary for the
safety of adjacent properties and adequacy of foundation support and to prevent
damage as a result of water runoff.
            2.   Fill shall not be placed over stumps or other organic or
unstable material, unless in compliance with recommendations from a
geotechnical engineer. All fill should be compacted to provide stability of
material and to prevent undesirable settlement or landsliding, and proper
benching shall be provided, as required, in accordance with the recommendations
of a geotechnical engineer.
            3.   In any development with slopes greater than 30%, a registered
professional engineer shall design the structure, in cooperation with the
project geotechnical engineer, so that there shall be adequate support against
downhill creep acting upon each caisson or pier penetrating soil that is prone
to creep.
            4.   No soil from excavations of any kind shall be placed on
slopes, except as permitted by these regulations.
            5.   Grading under tree drip lines, including trenching for
utilities, shall be avoided. Drainage around existing trees shall remain
undisturbed to ensure preservation of trees.
            6.   All permitted excavation and fill operations shall be reviewed
by a qualified soils technician under the direction of a registered
professional geotechnical engineer; such review and inspection reports shall be
the responsibility of the developer and shall be submitted to the Zoning
Inspector in a timely manner.
   (D)   Administration and review procedures.
      (1)   Prior to any development of any lot or land which lies totally or
partially within the areas defined in division (B) above, the following
information shall be submitted in the form of a site plan as regulated by §

soils engineer showing the following:
            1.   Results of surface and subsurface exploration, conditions of
the land, the major soils types on the site and extent and patterns of the
soils and procedures for performing the operations;
            2.   An evaluation of the effect on off-site slopes adjacent to the
proposed development;
            3.   Recommendations for foundation type, depth and locations;
            4.   Specifications for the borrow material or fill material, the
method to be used for filling and the requirements of its proposed
construction;
            5.   Proposed preparation of existing ground surface to receive
fill;
            6.   Proposed terraces and ditches where necessary to control
surface drainage and debris; and
            7.   Proposed subsurface drainage if necessary for stability.
         (f)   Identify areas of excavation and fill, and estimated number of
cubic yards displaced;
         (g)   Identify existing drainage on the site, the proposed method and
storage and disposal of water generated by development of the tract and
calculated surface water fun-off from the site before and after construction,
measured in cubic feet per second; and
         (h)   Provide a timing schedule and sequence indicating the
anticipated starting and completion dates of the development sequence;
stripping or clearing; rough grading; construction; final grading; and
vegetative establishment and maintenance. The schedule shall also indicate the
time o exposure of each area prior to the completion of effective erosion and
sediment control measures.
      (2)   The Planning Commission, and/or its duly authorized representative,
may waive or modify the requirements of this regulation for plans,
specifications, field supervision and summary reports only if the application
for a zoning certificate contains a written statement by a registered
professional engineer or geotechnical engineer which states, to the
satisfaction of the Planning Commission and/or its duly authorized
representative, that the proposed development, if his or her recommended
procedures are followed, will not:
         (a)   Obstruct, damage or adversely affect existing sewerage or
drainage, public or private;
         (b)   Cause a stagnant pond of water to form;
         (c)   Create slope stability problems on the subject and/or adjacent
properties;
         (d)   Cause detrimental erosion or sedimentation; or
         (e)   That the proposed excavation or fill is in an isolated, self-
contained area and that there is no apparent danger or environmental damage to
adjacent public or private property.
      (3)   The site plan, cut and fill permit and other information required
in division (B)(2) above shall be reviewed by the City Engineer who will
recommend to the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
what effect the proposed development will have on hillside slippage and soil
erosion.
      (4)   After consideration of the recommendations of the Planning
Commission, and/or its duly authorized representative, may grant a permit for
use of the site in accordance with the submitted plans.
If, after review of the plans required by this section of the ordinance, the
Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, determines that
said proposed plans will not minimize hillside slippage, the Planning
Commission shall deny a permit for the development of said land and the site
shall be limited to those open type uses, excluding structures, as permitted or
conditionally permitted in the Conservation Zone (CO).

§ 3.32 DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR “BIG-BOX” RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS.
   (A)   It is in the best interest of the city to minimize the possible
blighting effect that abandoned shopping centers and large retail
establishments can have on the larger area or neighborhood in which they are
located. By imposing additional standards in the form of design guidelines for
such centers, these effects can be minimized and future redevelopment and reuse
of vacant retail buildings encouraged through proper facility design, without
expenditure of public funds. For this reason, the Planning Commission has
adopted design guidelines for shopping centers containing a single “big-box”
establishment larger than 50,000 square feet in size. These additional
standards are listed in Appendix A of this ordinance, Big-Box Design Standards,
and are consistent with guidelines which have been established in other cities
and counties across the United States for such facilities.
   (B)   The guidelines are to be met in the design of a planned shopping
center containing a single “big-box” establishment larger than 50,000 square
feet in size, unless waived by the Planning Commission through its approval of
a final development plan. These design guidelines are intended to provide
professional designers and the Planning Commission with direction for improved
development plans which address the following issues:
      (1)   Variation in building heights and identifiable customer service
entrances and pedestrian entryways;
      (2)   Uninterrupted facades, windows, allowance for smaller stores or
departments having exterior entrances and back or side facades;
      (3)   Landscaping and/or screening of outdoor display of building
materials or other similar bulky products and of trash collection and loading
areas;
      (4)   Pedestrian circulation in relation to vehicular movements and
common open spaces for pedestrians; and
      (5)   Parking lot orientation adjacent to public streets.

   (E)   Design standards. All proposed residential conservation developments
(RCD) in this district shall be assessed in terms of the design standards
contained in this section. These regulations are purposely general in order to
facilitate innovative and quality housing design. Each applicant or developer
is required to demonstrate how the proposed RCD fulfills the following design
standards in a written or graphic manner.
      (1)   Streetscape. The streetscape of a RCD within this district should
be designed in detail specifying lighting, placement of street trees, sidewalks
or alternate pedestrian ways and street furniture (benches, wastebaskets and
the like). A row of deciduous shade trees between the street and the sidewalk
shall be installed in order to enclose the street and separate pedestrian
traffic from vehicular traffic. Street trees shall be spaced 40 feet apart
along both sides of the street. Street trees shall meet the landscaping
requirements of
Article 10 in this ordinance. Bricked or cobblestone sidewalks, street
crossings or streets are strongly encouraged as an alternative to concrete or
asphalt, but must be handicapped accessible and meet current ADA requirements.
      (2)   Preliminary house design or architecture. Homes should be designed
in the same architectural style (characteristic in form and detail of a
particular architectural period or type). A consistent architectural style
should encourage visual harmony and the concept of unified diversity: while
avoiding excessively similar or monotonous “cookie cutter” house designs. The
unified architectural style of the house designs shall also apply to materials,
colors, roof types and entrances, and shall include traditional, regionally
influenced architectural forms and elements, and shall allow variations within
it. The architectural theme shall also relate to existing structures on the
project site and adjacent sites, especially if such existing structures are
historic. The use of architectural guidelines is required for multi-phased
projects. Front yards shall be consistent and are not recommended to exceed 25
feet in depth in order to facilitate a neighborhood connection and allow rear
yards to accommodate private garages and garden areas. In order to achieve a
neo-traditional style, it is suggested that all homes shall contain covered
porches oriented to the street.
      (3)   Focal point. Any opportunity for a strong, central focus should be
studied and developed. These central places are usually a key to establishing
community identity. In addition, the development of unique entrances and
community greens are strongly recommended.
      (4)   Fences, walls and landscaped berms. Consideration should be given
to brick walls, fences and landscaped berms, which would produce a continuous
cohesive wall of enclosure on a lot line (and are especially encouraged in
front yards) or adjacent to a road. These fences and walls shall be designed
and maintained in relationship with the character of the surrounding land uses
and structures.
      (5)   Landscaping. Consideration should be given to the predominance of a
quality and quantity of landscaping and an emphasis shall be given to
streetscape areas, buffer zones and the provision of significant landscaping
(in terms of the size of landscaped portions of the site). Landscaping details
will be evaluated on the entire site and properties. A special attempt should
be made to preserve the existing vegetation and scenic areas, if any and
encourage additional open space for the public’s benefit. Existing topography,
significant tree cover and watercourses/bodies shall be largely preserved and
incorporated into the project design, where appropriate, and should be
consistent with the remainder of these regulations. Plantings should be used to
soften the impact of parking and loading areas. Plant material should be
selected on the basis of texture and color and for its ultimate growth to
provide a visual screen for the public in accordance with
Appendix B of this ordinance. The use of landscape design guidelines is
required for multi-phased projects.
      (6)   Utilities. All utility service lines to the building and possible
main lines to or within the site shall be located and installed underground.
Alternatives may be possible if this requirement is economically infeasible.
      (7)   Detention/retention ponds or lakes. Large detention/retention ponds
or lakes should be discouraged in the front yard or in an area viewed from a
public street if not used for both storm water management and aesthetic
purposes. Smaller detention/retention ponds or lakes appropriately designed and
landscaped should be encouraged and distributed throughout the site and may
appear in the front yard or in an area viewed from a public street. Surface
drainage and flood water retention shall be planned to not adversely impact the
adjoining properties.
   (F)   Area and height regulations for conditionally permitted uses. No
conditional building and/or use shall be erected or structurally altered
hereafter, except in accordance with the following regulations:
      (1)   Minimum lot area: 22,500 square feet;
      (2)   Minimum lot width at minimum setback line (excluding flag lots):
150 feet;
      (3)   Minimum front, side (on each side of lot) and rear yard depth: 50
feet; and
      (4)   Maximum building height: 35 feet.
   (G)   Other development controls.
      (1)   Off-street parking and loading and/or unloading shall be provided
in accordance with
Articles 5  and
6  of this ordinance.
      (2)   No outdoor storage of any objectionable material (useable or waste)
shall be permitted in this zone, except within enclosed containers.
      (3)   No lighting shall be permitted which would glare from this zone
onto any street, road, highway, deeded right-of-way or into any adjacent
property.
      (4)   Where any yard of any conditional use permitted in this zone abuts
property in a single-family zone, a ten-foot wide screening area as regulated
by §
3.18 of this ordinance shall be required.
      (5)   No motor vehicle which is abandoned, non-functional, in a state of
disrepair or lacking in a valid license, shall be stored in excess of 72 hours
unless it is in a completely enclosed building. Vehicles with three or more
axles; any trailer with three or more axles; any commercial, industrial and/or
similar type trailer used for storage; and any similar type equipment which is
motorized, abandoned, non-functional or in a state of disrepair shall not be
permitted outside of a completely enclosed building on any lot or parcel of
land. Any agricultural implement and/or similar type equipment or apparatus
which is abandoned, non-functional or in a state of disrepair shall not be
permitted outside of a completely enclosed building on any lot or parcel of
land. (See §
3.24 of this ordinance for regulations pertaining to parking or storing of
semi- tractors, tractors, panel trucks, buses, motor homes, campers vehicles
with three or more axles, trailers, mobile homes, campers, inoperable vehicles
and other similar types of equipment.)
      (6)   No heavy construction or industrial equipment or machinery,
including, but not limited to, bobcats, backhoes, bulldozers, track hoes, front
end loaders, earthmovers and the like, shall be stored in this zone, regardless
of whether the equipment or machinery is operable or inoperable, regardless of
whether it can be stored in an enclosed area, and regardless of whether it can
be stored in an area in which its view is obstructed from neighbors or the
public.

§ 4.21 (CT) CORRIDOR TRANSITION OVERLAY ZONE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the Corridor Transition (CT) Overlay Zone is
to promote orderly and harmonious development in areas located along the U.S.
27 and “AA” Highway corridors. Specifically, the purpose of this district in
conjunction with the underlying zoning classification is to:
      (1)   Encourage clustering (while discouraging strip commercial
development) and a mixture of land uses consistent with the development of a
city center that provides an adequate transition in land use with minimal
impact to adjacent land uses;
      (2)   Facilitate development consistent with local and regional
demographic/socioeconomic trends as well as the enhancement of the city’s
economic and service capacity;
      (3)   More effectively coordinate development and transportation planning
in order to bring about a more concentrated, desirable urban form and to
increase accessibility between development centers and the rest of the city;
      (4)   Encourage more well-planned, innovative and aesthetically pleasing
design of structures, and signage while maximize landscaping opportunities in
the entrance corridors to the community; and
      (5)   Ensure agreement with the goals and objectives and land use
development policies in the city’s comprehensive plan.
   (B)   General. A Corridor Transition (CT) Overlay Zone may be permitted only
to be superimposed over areas bordering U.S. Highway 27 and those areas of the
city adjacent to the “AA” Highway; provided that, all other conditions and
provisions of this Section of the ordinance, the applicable requirements of the
subdivision regulations, and any additional requirements as may be determined

§ 4.24 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The intent of this section is to provide a permissive, flexible and
alternative zoning district for innovative, mixed use developments or physical
design proposals only if they are designed properly and community impacts are
addressed. This district allows for the combination of differing uses not
normally located near each other under conventional zoning, but would permit
these combinations of uses if design standards or controls are in place to make
the uses compatible. In addition, it is the purpose of this district to
eliminate sprawling strip commercial development by creating compatible
clusters of commercial, office and residential uses while also facilitating
multi-modal transportation and convenience to those residing in the
development.
      (2)   Density, open space, infrastructure and other land use factors and
impacts are significant in the review of any planned unit development. Where
building intensity is increased on a particular portion of a planned unit
development, then the amount of open space, retention of existing vegetation,
buffer areas and new landscape, public commons, community open space and parks
shall be evaluated for proportionate increase for the remainder of the planned
unit development. In addition, a planned unit development may vary in height,
use, organization, design, intensity, size or other features of the proposed
development.
   (B)   Provisions.
      (1)   Due to the unique characteristics of planned unit developments,
special provisions governing the development of land for this purpose are
required. Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of
this regulation and those of other articles, the provisions of this section of
the regulations shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this article shall be
governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this regulation or be
modified under the authority of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The planned unit development (PUD) notation or zoning
classification on a parcel of land does not prohibit all uses. The PUD
designation is intended to allow some uses compatible to surrounding land uses,
the intensity of such use or uses being subject to the review provisions of
this section. PUD Districts shall originate from the Alexandria Planning
Commission, City Council or private property owner and shall be approved by the
City Council. If the city or Planning Commission initiates the rezoning of a
parcel to PUD, the property owner will be required to submit a concept plan for
action before the Planning Commission and City Council.
      (3)   Upon approval by the city’s Planning Commission and the City
Council, a PUD may be applied in lieu of any other existing district in this
order. Upon approval of this request and the concept plan from the appropriate
legislative body, the official zoning map shall be annotated for the land area
involved so that the district name includes the annotation “PUD”. The planned
unit development district shall be approved by the Planning Commission and the
City Council in the manner prescribed in Article 14 of this ordinance.
   (C)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   In the PUD District, the number and type of permitted uses are
flexible if they are compatible with adjoining land uses, the objectives of
this district and harmonious with the character of the overall project. Each
developer or applicant is required to define in detail the type of residential
and commercial uses proposed for the site. In a primarily residential
development (where at least 51% of the total acreage is proposed for
residential development), commercial, office and indoor/outdoor recreational
uses are permitted in the PUD District only if they appear on a neighborhood
scale and are oriented toward the convenience of the commercial, office and
indoor/outdoor recreational needs of the residents. Commercial, office and
indoor recreational uses are allowed at a maximum of 80 square feet of
commercial/office/recreational use per one residential dwelling unit or lot.
There is no maximum limit on the amount of land devoted to outdoor or passive
recreation (open space). However, at least 20% of the total acreage must be
retained for recreational use or open space. Conversely, in a primarily
commercial development (where at least 51% of the total acreage is proposed for
commercial development), residential uses are allowed in the Planned Unit
Development District to the extent permitted in the following table:
 
Total Acreage of Site Use Cannot Exceed**
1 - 100 acres                             15%
100+ acres                                25%
Notes:
** pertains to residential uses
 
      (2)   The developer or applicant may use those uses listed in any of the
zoning classifications of this order so as to describe the type of residential,
commercial or office use proposed as part of the planned unit development
(PUD).
   (D)   Minimum size for PUD District. No PUD District shall be permitted on
less than ten acres of land. However, development of a smaller tract adjacent
to an existing PUD District may be permitted if the proposed development
conforms to and extends the original development as if the new area had been a
part of the original development.
   (E)   Minimal standards and amendments to the development plan.
      (1)   The PUD District shall be subject to the supplemental performance
and development standards of this section of the zoning ordinance, unless
superseded by any special requirements, conditions or other particulars imposed
by the Planning Commission during the development plan application and hearing
phases described in this section. Such special conditions may include but not
be limited to provision governing parking, signage, common open space, lands or
facilities, disposition of open land, infrastructure provisions, including any
physical design and/or any other requirement found to be necessary, appropriate
or desirable for the purposes of this district.
      (2)   Amendments to the approved development plan involving changes in
the proposed uses, intensity or other elements must be submitted to the city’s
Planning Commission for review and approval. If the changes are determined by
the Planning Commission to be minor in nature, the Planning Commission may
approve the changes and the applicant/developer may proceed with site plan
review or subdivision review. If the changes are deemed to be major or
substantial, then the applicant or developer shall be required to file an
application before the city’s Planning Commission for a change in a previously
approved development plan and a new public hearing will be scheduled in
accordance with the provisions of this section of the plan.
      (3)   Changes requiring submittal of a new development plan and public
hearing include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Any increase in density or decrease of more than 25%;
         (b)   Re-allocation of approved land uses, and major changes in lot
arrangement or building lots;
         (c)   Changes in the list of approved uses;
         (d)   Modification of the location of approved uses;
         (e)   Alterations in functional uses of open space, where such change
conflicts with approval of the development plan;
         (f)   Alteration of site design requirements, such as the location and
type of required landscaping, signage, building height and the like; and
         (g)   Modifications to proposed improvements that affect the local
traffic patterns, the level of service of existing roadways, internal street
system or parking area, drainage management structures, and provision of
utilities.
   (F)   Maximum intensity and density.
      (1)   Intensity is a unit of measurement defining the level of activity
in acres or square footage of all uses in relation to the overall size of the
entire site.
      (2)   Density is defined as a unit of measurement involving a portion of
an activity devoted to a specific use identified in acres or square footage in
relation to a portion of an overall site.
      (3)   Generally, the maximum building intensity for PUD Districts
consists of the following:
         (a)   Office uses: 20,000 square feet/acre; and
         (b)   Commercial uses: 15,000 square feet/acre.
      (4)   Greater intensities than these can be permitted if multi-story
buildings and multi-level parking are utilized and the amount of green space
can be shown to increase. Necessary infrastructure, including fire protection,
must be adequately provided.
      (5)   Generally, the development intensity permitted in PUD Districts
shall be consistent with the Future Land Use Map contained in the city’s
comprehensive plan. Proposed developments should be planned in clusters and
provide innovative design as outlined in the criteria and design standards
contained in this section of the ordinance. Greater overall development density
may be granted if the development includes dedication of appropriate
developable land for public facilities and/or public recreation uses in
addition to preserving developmentally sensitive areas as open space. Any
increase in intensity over that recommended by the comprehensive plan must be
shown by the applicant to be appropriate in terms of infrastructure, adjacent
land uses and zoning, and provision of public land.
   (G)   Pre-application and procedure.
      (1)   The developer shall meet with the city’s Planning Commission staff
prior to the submission of a development plan. The purpose of the meeting will
be to discuss early and informally the purpose and effect of the PUD District
and the criteria and standards which may apply, and to familiarize the
developer with the detailed objectives of the comprehensive plan and its
elements, and applicable zoning regulations.
      (2)   After the initial meeting with staff, the Planning Commission
requires that the development plan and an application form be submitted for
property located in a proposed planned unit development. The development plan
may be filed with the Planning Commission by the owner(s), owner by contract
(option) or lessee of property for which the planned unit development is
proposed. The contents of the development plan submittal and shall follow the
process and include the items as listed in § 4.19(C), (D) and (E).
      (3)   Approval of the development plan shall not be construed to endorse
engineering feasibility or plan elements that do not meet the development
standards of this ordinance or subdivision regulations unless an exception is
specifically granted through the review and approval of the development plan.
The Planning Commission may seek assistance in making its recommendation from
any appropriate source.
      (4)   Upon receipt of an application for approval of the Planned Unit
Development District or development plan, the Planning Commission shall hold at
least one public hearing, within 30 days of receipt of the application, after
notice as required for amendment under KRS Chapter 424 and as stated in Article
14 of this ordinance.
   (H)   Criteria for approval. No application or development plan shall be
approved for a Planned Unit Development District under the provisions of these
regulations unless each district and application fulfills the following
standards.
      (1)   The planned unit development shall generally conform to the adopted
comprehensive plan with respect to type, character and intensity of use and
impact on public facilities, services and road network. The intensity of the
planned unit development, in particular, should be generally consistent with
the Future Land Use Map and development policies for the area. Deviation from
the comprehensive plan is dependent upon whether the site is part of an urban
service area for public infrastructure and upon the provision of public
facilities, services and roads by the applicant to mitigate the impact of the
proposed development on these infrastructure systems.
      (2)   The planned unit development shall efficiently utilize the site,
and shall protect and preserve the scenic assets and natural features by
incorporating existing trees, streams and topographic features into the site
design. The development shall include the provision that designated natural
areas, scenic areas (views/vistas) and developmentally sensitive areas as
identified in the comprehensive plan will constitute permanent open space or be
dedicated to public or semi-public organizations for recreational use. At least
20% of the total site acreage shall be dedicated as recreation or open space.
      (3)   The planned unit development provides interconnected open spaces,
recreational areas and opportunities for multi-modal transportation (i.e.,
sidewalks, walking trails, bicycle trails and the like) as identified in the
city’s comprehensive plan.
      (4)   Each developer or applicant is required to define in detail the
type of residential and commercial uses proposed for the site. Commercial,
office and indoor/outdoor recreational uses are permitted in the PUD District
only if they appear on a neighborhood scale and are oriented toward
conveniently serving the commercial, office and indoor/outdoor recreational
needs of the residents.
      (5)   Although the PUD District encourages a variety of housing types and
mixture of densities within one development, housing shall be clustered by
density type. In no case should there be a mixing of densities within a
residential cluster. For example, single-family homes shall not be sited
directly adjacent to duplexes, apartment complexes and the like within the same
cluster.
      (6)   Where appropriate, the planned unit development shall include
developable land that is unbuilt and available for purchase or donation to
public agencies for recreation or public facility building sites. This
provision of land can constitute one reason for increased development densities
on portions of the site or even increased overall development intensity in
relation to the comprehensive plan; provided, other public facilities and
services are adequately provided.
      (7)   The planned unit development shall not hinder nor deter development
or surrounding undeveloped properties in accordance with the adopted
comprehensive plan. Where different land uses or development densities exist
adjacent to or within the site, substantial buffers and transitions between the
PUD and the adjacent use must be provided.
      (8)   The planned unit development shall be located in an area in which
transportation, police and fire protection, other public facilities and
utilities, including sanitary sewerage are provided, or will be available and
adequate for the uses proposed. The applicant shall make provision for such
facilities or utilities which are not presently available or shall construct
such facilities for the eventual connection into a public system.
      (9)   The development will not have an adverse impact on the surrounding
area and will be harmonious and compatible with adjacent uses. The term
COMPATIBILITY refers to, but is not limited to, size, scale, mass,
architectural design and landscaping.
      (10)   The extent to which the proposed planned unit development meets
the requirements, standards and stated purpose of the PUD regulations and
design criteria.
      (11)   The proposal fully complies with the minimum requirements
contained in this ordinance and subdivision regulations.
      (12)   The proposal must not adversely affect the public health, safety
and welfare. This flexible approach to planned unit development is intended to
provide an opportunity and incentive to the developer to achieve excellence in
physical, social and economic planning. To be approved, the property owner or
developer must demonstrate achievement of the above objectives and standards.
In addition, a property owner or developer’s request for a planned unit
development is assessed in terms of its impact on the existing conditions of
the surrounding land uses, utility systems, road network and public facilities
and services. The applicant must provide this information to the Planning
Commission in written and/or graphic form as part of the development plan
submittal. In summary, it is the burden of proof for the property owner or
developer to present why the concept plan is unique and requires the special
consideration that can only be fulfilled by the Planned Unit Development
District. Equally important is that the property in question could be unique
with certain qualities and/or amenities that warrant the special consideration
of the Planned Unit Development District. Proposed developments that cannot be
shown to meet these standards may be more appropriately developed under
conventional zoning districts.
   (I)   Design standards. The proposed uses and development plan in each
Planned Unit Development District shall be assessed in terms of the design
standards contained in this section. Each applicant or developer is required to
demonstrate how the proposed development plan fulfills the following design
standards in a written or graphic manner.
      (1)   Height. The height of any structure shall be compatible with the
existing buildings in the area, and proposed structures within the project
site.
      (2)   Placement or location of buildings. Consideration should be given
to the most appropriate location of buildings based upon access and direct
visibility. The location of any building should not interrupt a continuous
visual pattern from public view or a public street. Building location should be
planned to accomplish a transition with the landscaped, pedestrian and parking
areas. Building setbacks can vary in order to allow appropriate building
location. The setback on the perimeter of the Planned Unit Development District
shall be large enough to protect the privacy and amenity of adjoining uses both
existing and anticipated.
      (3)   Preliminary building design or architecture. Buildings should be
designed in the same architectural style as if part of a large commercial,
residential or office center. Individual buildings not part of the larger
development should be compatible with surrounding structures. All structures
shall have consistent design treatment on all facades. The unified
architectural style or building design shall also apply to materials, colors,
roof types and entrances, and shall include traditional, regionally influenced
architectural forms and elements, and shall allow variations within it. The
architectural theme shall also relate to existing structures on the project
site and adjacent sites, especially if such existing structures are historic.
The use of architectural guidelines is required for multi-phased projects.
      (4)   Scale. Consideration shall be given to the scale of each building
and architectural detail, which relates to the size of an individual and the
natural environment. In general, planned unit developments shall have a
pedestrian scale and orientation. In rendering this decision, emphasis shall be
placed on mass and how it relates to open space.
      (5)   Elevation. The elevation of any site or structure should be
determined by the grade of any existing or proposed public road. Consideration
should be given to the relationship between the width and height of the front,
side and rear elevations of any building from a public road. Exposed
foundations from a public street should be minimized.
      (6)   Historic and prehistoric features. Historic features on the project
site shall be retained, utilized and incorporated into the overall project
design if physically and economically feasible.
      (7)   Streetscape. The streetscape of a PUD should be designed in detail
specifying lighting, placement of street trees and street furniture (benches,
wastebaskets and the like).
      (8)   Focal point. Any opportunity for a strong, central focus should be
studied and developed. These central places are usually a key to establishing
community identity.
      (9)   Paved surfaces. Emphasis should be placed on preserving at a
reasonable rate the amount of open space. The interior road system, sidewalk
system, and parking lot should be designed with this in mind. Paved surface
refers to cement, brick pavement, asphalt, cobblestone or other similar type
surfaces. Parking areas should be treated with decorative elements, fence or
wall extensions, plantings and berms as other means to screen parking areas
from public view or soften their visual impact. Although it is recommended that
parking areas be dispersed throughout the site and located to the rear of
structures, all large parking lots shall be designed with landscaped islands.
Parking lots and driveway aisles should be either asphalt or concrete.
Landscaped entrances with trees and bushes should be encouraged near the
entrances of the development.
      (10)   Fences, walls and landscaped berms. Consideration should be given
to brick walls, fences and landscaped berms, which would produce a continuous
cohesive wall of enclosure on a lot line or adjacent to a road. These fences
and walls shall be designed and maintained in relationship with the character
of the surrounding land uses and structures.
      (11)   Landscaping. Consideration should be given to the predominance of
a quality and quantity of landscaping and an emphasis shall be given to
streetscape areas, buffer zones and the provision of significant landscaping
(in terms of the size of landscaped areas, and quantity and quality of
landscape materials) within the proposed developed portions of the site.
Landscaping details will be evaluated on the entire site and surrounding any
proposed structure and shall be reviewed in relation to adjacent properties. A
special attempt should be made to preserve the existing vegetation and scenic
areas, if any and encourage additional open space for the public’s benefit.
Existing topography, significant tree cover and watercourses/bodies shall be
largely preserved and incorporated into the project design, where appropriate,
and should be consistent with the remainder of these regulations. Plantings
should be used to soften the impact of parking and loading areas. Plant
material should be selected on the basis of texture and color and for its
ultimate growth to provide a visual screen for the public. Scenic views and
vistas as identified in the city’s comprehensive plan shall be remain unblocked
or uninterrupted, particularly as seen from public thoroughfares. The use of
landscape design guidelines is required for multi-phased projects.
      (12)   Grading. All mature vegetation, prime agricultural soils,
floodplains, wetlands and steep slopes shall be protected from excessive
clearing, grading, filling and construction activities. In addition, new
construction on prominent hilltops or ridges is discouraged.
      (13)   Open space and recreational uses. Planned unit developments shall
make a provision for preserving open space and devoting an appropriate portion
of the site to meet the recreational needs of the residential population. A
minimum of 20% of the total site acreage shall be retained as a recreation area
or common open space and dedicated to a public or private entity for operation
and maintenance. Such open space shall be physically situated so as to be
readily accessible, available to and useable by all residents of the PUD. These
spaces may be provided in the form of parks, plazas, arcades, commons, trails,
sports courts or other athletic and recreational areas, outdoor areas for the
display of sculptural elements and the like. Land reservations for community
facilities may be considered in lieu of useable open space. Recreation area and
open space areas identified in the city’s comprehensive plan shall be utilized
for recreational purposes or preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (14)   Signage. Signage should be designed to protect the visual order of
any site and to minimize the impact of adjacent properties. Consideration
should be given to the number, location, size and height of any building
mounted sign or freestanding sign. A consistent signage theme shall be provided
within the planned unit development. Building mounted signs shall be the
predominant signage on the project site. Freestanding signs shall be monument
style and limited in number, size and height. The use of signage design
guidelines is required for multi-phased projects.
      (15)   Utilities. All utility service lines to the building and possible
main lines to or within the site shall be located and installed underground.
Alternatives may be possible if this requirement is economically infeasible.
      (16)   Detention/retention ponds or lakes. Large detention/retention
ponds or lakes should be discouraged in the front yard or in an area viewed
from a public street if not used for both storm water management and aesthetic
purposes. Smaller detention/retention ponds or lakes appropriately designed and
landscaped should be encouraged and distributed throughout the site and may
appear in the front yard or in an area viewed from a public street. Surface
drainage and flood water retention shall be planned to not adversely impact the
adjoining properties.
      (17)   Transportation design. Principal vehicular access shall be from
major streets and access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic
flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or
pedestrian traffic. Maximum separation of vehicular traffic on major roads from
pedestrian and recreational areas shall occur. The provision of transportation
connections (street connections, pedestrian paths and sidewalks, bicycle
facilities) shall be provided in all planned unit developments unless
physically unfeasible or undesirable due to land use characteristics. Rural
roadside character shall be preserved by avoiding development fronting directly
into existing public roads. Buffer zones shall be established along scenic
corridors and roadways.
      (18)   Multi-modal transportation system. Planned unit developments shall
incorporate multi-modal transportation elements in the development, depending
on the foreseeable needs of future residents and users of the site and the
relationship of the project site to the community at large. Such multi-modal
elements may include provisions for mass transit stops or stations, car pooling
lots, pedestrian and bicycle paths and lanes, bicycle parking areas and the
like. The proposed pedestrian circulation system should be designed to assure
that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and
activities or special features within the open space system. All roadside
footpaths should connect with off road trails, which in turn should link with
potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing open
space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable). Sidewalks, walking and
bicycle trails identified in the city’s comprehensive plan must be incorporated
into the overall design of the project.
      (19)   Location of land uses. Land uses shall be located primarily for
convenience to the area and compatibility with the adjoining land uses. If
conflicting land uses are intended to be located near each other, measures
shall be taken to mitigate the impact of the uses upon each other.
   (J)   Findings necessary for a zoning map amendment or development plan in a
Planned Unit Development District. Each application shall conform to the
criteria in Article 14 of this ordinance in presenting the basis for granting a
zoning map amendment or approval of a development plan in a Planned Unit
Development District. In addition, each application shall be in conformance
with the standards and requirements stated in this section of the ordinance.
   (K)   Action by the Planning Commission and City Council.
      (1)   Within 90 days of receipt of an application for a development plan
and after the public hearing required in this section has been conducted, the
Planning Commission shall determine whether the development plan is consistent
with the intent, purpose, requirements and standards or this regulation;
whether the proposed development advances the general welfare of the community
and neighborhood, and whether the benefits, combination of various land uses,
innovation of physical design and the inter-relationship with the land uses in
the surrounding area justify any deviation from standard district regulations
as mentioned in the objectives section of this regulation.
      (2)   Final action for approval in principle, as described in Article 14
of this ordinance, or denial of a Planned Unit Development Zoning District
shall be made by the City Council. After recommendation of the city’s Planning
Commission all materials constituting the record and recommendations of the
Planning Commission shall be transmitted to the City Council. Within 90 days
from the Commission’s recommendation, the City Council may take action to
approve or deny the PUD zoning map designation. Approval shall be by ordinance.
When a PUD zoning designation is approved, the subject property so zoned shall
be respectively designated as “PUD” on the official zoning map of the city.
Upon approval of a map amendment to utilize either classification, the notation
“CD” shall be placed on the official zoning map as well. A certificate of land
use restriction (CLUR) giving notice of the approval for PUD Zoning District
designation shall be filed within 30 days of final action as explained in §
13.16 of this ordinance. If disapproved, the City Council shall state the
reasons for disapproval.
   (L)   Subsequent review after development plan approval. After the city’s
Planning Commission has approved a development plan in a PUD District, the
applicant or property owner may proceed through the subdivision review or site
plan review approval process. Subdivision review requirements can be found in
the city’s subdivision regulations and site plan review requirements are
outlined in this ordinance.
   (M)   Ownership and maintenance of open space. Different ownership and
management options apply to permanently protected open space created through
the development process. The open space shall remain undivided and may be owned
and managed by a homeowner’s association, the city or a recognized land trust
or conservancy. A public land dedication (not exceeding 10% of the total parcel
size) may be required by the city in order to facilitate the connections of
pedestrian ways or open or scenic views and vistas as identified in the city’s
comprehensive plan. A narrative describing ownership, use and maintenance
responsibilities shall be submitted for all common and public improvements,
utilities and open spaces.
   (N)   Ownership standards. Common open space within a development shall be
owned, administered and maintained by any of the following methods, either
individually or in combination, and is subject to approval by the Planning
Commission.
      (1)   Offer of dedication.
         (a)   The city shall have the first and last offer of dedication of
undivided open space in the event said land is to be conveyed. Dedication shall
take the form of fee simple ownership. The city may, but not be required to,
accept undivided open space; provided:
            1.   Such land is accessible to the residents of the city;
            2.   There is no cost of acquisition other than any costs
incidental to the transfer of ownership such as title insurance; and
            3.   The city agrees to and has access to maintain such lands.
         (b)   Where the city accepts dedication of common space that contains
improvements, the city may require the posting of financial security to ensure
structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. The amount of financial security shall not exceed 15% of the actual
cost of installation of said improvements.
      (2)   Homeowner’s association. The undivided open space and associated
facilities may be held in common ownership by a homeowner’s association. The
association shall be formed and operated under the following provisions.
         (a)   The developer shall provide a description of the association
including its bylaws and methods for maintaining the open space.
         (b)   The association shall be organized by the developer and shall be
operated with a financial subsidy from the developer, before the sale of any
lots within the development.
         (c)   Membership in the association is automatic (mandatory) for all
purchasers of homes therein and their successors. The conditions and timing of
transferring control of the association from the developer to homeowners shall
be identified.
         (d)   The association shall be responsible for maintenance of
insurance and taxes on undivided open space, enforceable by liens placed by the
city on the association. The association may place liens on homes or house lots
of its members who fail to pay their association dues in a timely manner. Such
liens may require the imposition of penalty interest charges.
         (e)   The members of the association shall share equitably the costs
of maintaining and developing such undivided open space. Shares shall be
defined within the association bylaws.
         (f)   In the event of the proposed transfer, within the methods
permitted in these regulations, of undivided open space land by the homeowner’s
association, or of the assumption of maintenance or undivided open space land
by the city, notice of such action shall be given to all property owners within
the development.
         (g)   The association shall have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and properly (and continually) maintain the undivided open
space.
         (h)   The homeowner’s association may lease open space lands to any
other qualified person, or corporation, for operation and maintenance of open
space lands, but such a lease agreement shall provide:
            1.   The residents of the development shall, at all times, have
access to the open space lands contained therein (except croplands during the
growing season);
            2.   The undivided open space to be leased shall be maintained for
the purposes set forth in this ordinance; and
            3.   The operation of open space facilities may be for the benefit
of the residents only, or may open to the residents of the city, at the
election of the developer and/or homeowner’s association, as the case may be.
         (i)   The lease shall be subject to the approval of the city and any
transfer or assignment of the lease shall be further subject to the approval of
the city. Lease agreements so entered upon shall be recorded in the Campbell
County Clerk’s office within 30 days of their execution and a copy of the
recorded lease shall be filed with the city.
   (O)   Transfer of easements to a private conservation organization. With the
permission of the city, an owner may transfer easements to a private, non-
profit organization, among whose purposes it is to conserve open space and/or
natural resources; provided that:
      (1)   The organization is acceptable to the city, and is a bona fide
conservation organization with perpetual existence;
      (2)   The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for proper reverter
or retransfer in the event that the organization becomes unwilling or unable to
continue carrying out its functions; and
      (3)   A maintenance agreement acceptable to the city is entered into by
the developer and the organization.
   (P)   Maintenance standards.
      (1)   (a)   The ultimate owner of the open space (typically a homeowner’s
association) shall be responsible for raising all monies required for
operations, maintenance or physical improvements to the open space through
annual dues, special assessments and the like.
         (b)   The homeowner’s association shall be authorized under its bylaws
to place liens on the property of the residents who fall delinquent in payment
of such dues, assessments and the like.
      (2)   In the event that the association or any successor organization
shall, at any time after establishment of a development containing undivided
open space, fail to maintain the undivided open space in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the development plan, the city may serve written
notice upon the owner of record, setting forth the manner in which the owner of
record has failed to maintain the undivided open space in a reasonable
condition.
      (3)   Failure to adequately maintain the undivided open space in
reasonable order and condition constitutes a violation of this regulation. The
city is hereby authorized to give notice, by personal service or by U.S. mail,
to the owner or occupant, as the case may be, of any violation, directing the
owner to remedy the same within 30 working days.
      (4)   Should any bill or bills for maintenance of undivided open space by
the city be unpaid by November 1 of each year, a late fee of 15% shall be added
to such bills and a lien shall be filed against the premises in the same manner
as other municipal claims.

ARTICLE 5: OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS
Section
   
5.0   General requirements
   
5.1   Specific off-street parking requirements
Editor’s note:
In all zones, off-street parking facilities for the storage or parking of motor
vehicles for use of occupants, employees and patrons of the building hereafter
erected, altered or extended, and all uses of the land after the effective date
of this ordinance, shall be provided and maintained as herein prescribed.
However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the date of adoption
of this ordinance; and, provided that, construction has not begun within 90
consecutive days of such effective date, off-street parking facilities in the
amounts required by this ordinance shall prevail.
§ 5.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Computation of parking spaces. In determining the number of parking
spaces required, if such spaces result in fractional parts thereof, the number
of said spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest whole number.
   (B)   Addition to buildings. Whenever the intensity of use of any building,
structure or premises shall be increased through addition of dwelling units,
gross floor area, seating capacity, change of use or other units of measurement
specified herein, additional parking spaces shall be provided in the amounts
hereafter specified for that use, if the existing parking space is inadequate
to serve such increase in intensity of use.
   (C)   Location of off-street parking facilities.
      (1)   Off-street parking facilities (subject to additional restrictions
according to screening requirements in § 3.18, and other requirements of this
ordinance) shall be located as follows.
         (a)   Single-Family Residential Zones (R-RE, R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-1D
and R-1V). Off-street parking may be permitted in driveways in the front, side
and rear yards, provided all requirements of this ordinance are met.
Additionally, off-street parking located in the rear yard shall be set back a
minimum of ten feet from the rear lot line. No off-street parking area, located
in the front yard in a single-family residential zone, may exceed 400 square
feet (two parking spaces) except, however, the Zoning Administrator may allow
additional off-street parking spaces to be located thereon; provided that:
            1.   The additional parking spaces will not cause the ratio of
unpaved area to paved area (parking and driveway areas) in the front yard to be
less than three to one (3:1);
            2.   A plan of the proposed parking area is submitted and approved
by the Zoning Administrator; and
            3.   All other requirements of this ordinance are met.
         (b)   Multi-Family Residential Zones (R-2 and R-3). Off-street parking
may be permitted in side or rear yards of permitted uses in these zones;
provided that, off-street parking facilities shall be set back a minimum of ten
feet from the rear lot line. Off-street parking may be permitted in required
front yards, only if approved according to an approved development plan.
         (c)   RMHP Zone. Off-street parking may be permitted on driveways on
minimum required front and side yards; provided that, all other requirements of
this ordinance are met.
         (d)   CT Zones. Off-street parking shall be permitted according to
approval of a final site plan as regulated by §
3.21 of this ordinance.
         (e)   B-1 and NSC Zones. Off-street parking and loading and unloading
and unloading areas may be permitted in minimum required front, side and rear
yards; provided that, all off-street parking facilities shall be set back a
minimum of five feet from any street right-of-way lines. Parking within the B-
1 Zone shall be placed in the rear and side yards where possible in order to
minimize the impact of new development in the Old Town District.
         (f)   PF Zone. Off-street parking, and loading and unloading areas may
be permitted in minimum required front, side and rear yards; provided that, all
off-street parking facilities shall be set back a minimum of five feet from any
street right-of-way lines.
      (2)   All off-street facilities shall be located on the same lot or
zoning lot as the building served, except for the following.
         (a)   Multi-family dwellings, where permitted in this ordinance, and
any use permitted in an industrial zone may supply off-street parking within
300 feet from such lot or zoning lot served, upon approval of the Zoning
Administrator; providing that, such off-street parking requirements of this
ordinance are complied with at all times.
         (b)   Further, the applicant must also show sufficient proof that such
off-street parking facilities would be impossible to provide the required off-
street parking space, as required herein, on the same lot or zoning lot
contiguous to the same lot or zoning lot as the building being served.
         (c)   Where two single-, two- or multi-family dwellings, which are
permitted herein and are exist at the time of adoption of this ordinance,
occupy a lot of such size that off-street parking could not be provided on the
same lot or zoning lot as the use being serve, said off-street parking may be
permitted to locate within a distance not to exceed 300 feet from said dwelling
or dwellings upon approval of the Zoning Administrator. In addition, said off-
street parking lot shall be located in the same zone as the use being served
and constructed in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance.
         (d)   Off-street parking, as required for “conditional uses” permitted
in the Residential (R) Zones, may be permitted to locate on another lot or
zoning lot than the building or use being served is located, when approval by
the Board of Adjustment; provided that, said parking is located within
reasonable walking distance of the use or building being served and available
at all times without restrictions for said purposes.
   (D)   Collective parking provision. Collective off-street parking facilities
may be provided; however, such facilities shall not be less than the sum of
such facilities as would otherwise be individually required, except as provided
for below.
      (1)   Collective parking provision.
         (a)   In granting collective parking approval, the following shall be
considered.
            1.   The required parking for the highest use shall be located on
the premises as the minimum requirement, additional parking, as determined by
the Planning Commission, shall be a minimum of 50% on premises. The other
percentage may be located off-premises based on written contracts to provide
said off-street parking.
            2.   The actual need for parking spaces for each individual use or
building in relation to the requirement provided under § 5.1 of this ordinance.
            3.   Times of actual need for parking of each individual use or
building and the relationship of these times to one another.
            4.   The internal control plan of the applicant shall be submitted
with the application for review.
            5.   The internal controls for scheduling the uses and said
controls and/or schedule may be accepted or changed by the Planning Commission,
but the internal control schedule shall be made a condition of approval.
            6.   The parking needed for scheduled uses on the premises shall
not exceed the number of parking spaces established by the Planning Commission.
            7.   Collective off-street parking located on another lot must be
located within 500 feet walking distance of the entrance to the use to be
served. Said walking access shall provide a safe means of pedestrian access to
and from the establishment being served.
            8.   Reserved spaces shall be counted in the minimum requirement
but cannot exceed 10% of the total number of parking spaces.
            9.   Allowance by the Planning Commission for such collective
parking facilities, on lots other than the lot upon which the building or use
being served is located, should be situated so as to ensure that such locations
will not result in added traffic problems, or traffic or pedestrian safety
problems.
         (b)   The Planning Commission is authorized after consideration to
issue a permit for not less than the required parking for the highest use on
the premises and any additional parking per use the Planning Commission
determines is necessary based upon the evidence.
      (2)   Shared parking provision. When any land or building is under the
same ownership, or upon submission of satisfactory guarantees of the continued
operation and proper maintenance of the shared parking facility, and the
proposed development is for two or more land uses excluding residential uses,
the number of minimum required parking spaces shall be computed by multiplying
the number of parking spaces normally required for each land use by the
appropriate percentage as shown in the following shared parking credit table
for each of the five periods shown. The number of parking spaces required is
then determined by adding the results in each column; the column total that
generates the highest number of parking spaces becomes the minimum parking
requirement.

   (E)   Driveway provisions.
      (1)   Except for Residential (R-RE and R-1) Zones, parking lots or areas
adjacent to streets, roads, highways or deeded rights-of-way shall have
driveways or openings not less than 12 feet in width and no more than 48 feet
in width at the curb, excluding curve radius. These curb cuts shall be so
located as to minimize traffic hazards and congestion. All each parking lot and
said parking lots shall be so designed that all vehicles leaving the facility
will be traveling forward to approaching traffic.
      (2)   In the case of R-RE and R-1 Residential Zones, no driveway width at
the street right- of-way junction shall be less than nine feet, nor more than
20 feet, excluding curb radius; providing that, this width may be increased if
it can be determined, after review and approval of the Zoning Administrator,
that said additional width will not impede the flow of traffic.
   (F)   Approval of modification of curb cuts required. Detailed plans shall
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator in the form of a site plan, as
regulated by §
3.21 of this ordinance, for approval of all curb cuts, driveway openings,
including modifications thereto, before a permit may be obtained. For the
purpose of minimizing the interference of traffic and congestion on the major
street system, as identified in the city’s comprehensive plan, the Zoning
Administrator shall limit the number of curb cuts along said streets. The
number of curb cut intersections with major streets shall be spaced at a
distance of not less than 800 feet apart. Access to abutting properties
fronting on said major streets shall be provided by a frontage or service road
connecting to the curb cut intersection. If the developer can show sufficient
proof in the form of a site plan or development plan, that spacing of curb cuts
less than 800 feet apart will not impede the movement of traffic flow alongside
major streets, then the Zoning Administrator may vary these requirements
accordingly.
   (G)   Driveways not computed as part of parking lot. Entrances, exits or
driveways shall not be computed as any apart of a required parking lot or area,
except in the case of the R-RE and R-1 Zones, where access driveways may be
used for parking and designed in accordance with the requirements of this
ordinance.
   (H)   Off-street parking space and access drives defined.
      (1)   For the purposes of this ordinance, each individual parking space
shall be a minimum of 162 square feet in area, exclusive of access drives of
aisles, and shall be a minimum of nine feet in width and 18 feet in length.
Such parking space shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven feet. Each
parking space shall be appropriately dimensioned for automobile parking. All
parking lots shall be laid out with the following minimum aisle or access drive
widths:
         (a)   Ninety-degree (perpendicular) parking: 24 feet (either one- or
two-way circulation);
         (b)   Sixty-degree (angle) parking: 18 feet (one-way circulation
only);
         (c)   Forty-five-degree (angle) parking: 13 feet (one-way
circulation);
         (d)   Thirty-degree (angle) parking: 11 feet (one-way circulation
only); and
         (e)   Zero-degree (parallel) parking: 12 feet (one-way circulation).
      (2)   When any combination of these types of parking is used (facing the
same aisle) the most restricted aisle or access drive width requirements shall
prevail.
   (I)   Parking and passenger loading zones for the disabled.
      (1)   In any commercial or employment district, or wherever any townhouse
of multi-family housing is provided, parking spaces for disabled people shall
be provided as indicated on the following table:

      (2)   Parking spaces for disabled people shall be at least eight feet
wide and 19 feet (20 feet in commercial zones) long, and shall have an adjacent
access aisle five feet wide, minimum. Two parking spaces for the disabled may
share a common access aisle.
      (3)   Access aisles for parking spaces for the disabled shall be part of
an accessible route to the building or facility which the parking space serves.
An acceptable designed curb ramp shall be provided. Specifications for curb
ramps may be obtained from the Kentucky Building Code. Access aisles and
accessible routes shall be protected in such a manner that no part of any
vehicle or any structure shall be allowed to interfere with access or use of
the aisle or route in any way.
      (4)   The location of parking spaces should be as close as possible to
the principal handicapped accessible entrance(s). In a multi-building
development or shopping center, the spaces should be dispersed to ensure easy
access and minimize the travel distance for the handicapped.
      (5)   Parking spaces for the disabled shall be designated as reserved for
the disabled by a sign showing the international symbol of accessibility. Such
signs shall be above grade.
   (J)   Off-street parking space to be used for parking only. Any vehicle
parking space shall be used for parking only. Any other use of such space,
including repair work or servicing of any kind other than in an emergency, or
the requirement of any pavement for the use of such space, shall be deemed to
constitute a separate commercial use in violation of the provisions of this
ordinance.
   (K)   No building shall be erected in off-street parking space. No building
of any kind shall be erected in any off-street parking lot, except a parking
garage containing parking spaces equal to the requirements set forth in this
section of the ordinance or a shelter house booth for a parking attendant;
providing, the number of spaces required are not reduced.
   (L)   Off-street parking space shall not be reduced. The required parking
area on any lot, as set forth and designated in this ordinance, shall not be
reduced or encroached upon in any manner.
   (M)   Parking plan approval required. Plans for all parking lot facilities,
including parking garages, shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for
review and for compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and such other
pertinent ordinances of the city. Such plans shall show the number of spaces
and arrangements or parking aisles, location of driveway entrances and exits,
provisions for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, location of sidewalks and
curbs on or adjacent to the property, utilities, location of shelters for
parking attendant, locations of signs, typical cross-sections of pavement, base
and sub-base in accordance with division (N) below, proposed grade of parking
lot, storm drainage facilities, location and type of lighting facilities and
such other information or plans as the circumstances may warrant.
   (N)   Paving. All parking and loading spaces set forth in this article,
including driveways, aisles, vehicle storage, outdoor storage and vehicle
circulation areas shall be paved with asphalt concrete or portland cement and
shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the city’s subdivision
regulations.
   (O)   Design and maintenance.
      (1)   Screening and landscaping. All open automobile parking areas
containing more than four parking spaces shall be effectively screened on each
side adjoining or fronting on any property situated in a residential zone by a
solid wall, fence or densely planted compact hedge a regulated by §
3.18 of this ordinance. Ground cover shrubs and trees shall be located and
maintained so as to not interfere with vehicular and pedestrian traffic on the
property or with sight distance clearance at entrances or exits.
      (2)   Lighting. Any parking area intended to be used during non-daylight
hours shall be properly illuminated to avoid accidents. During the development
or site planning process, the Zoning Administrator has the authority to require
plans specifying foot candle minimums and illumination patterns when lighting
is an integral part of a developments use. Any lights used to illuminate any
out-of- doors area shall be arranged to minimize direct illumination,
reflection or glare on any adjoining property or on any public street. Any
lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be directed away
from property in any residential zone in such a way as not to create a
nuisance.
      (3)   Ingress and egress to parking areas. Any parking area shall be
designed in such a manner that any vehicle entering or leaving the parking area
from or into a public or private street shall be traveling in a forward motion.
Access driveways for parking areas or loading spaces shall be located in such a
way that any vehicle entering or leaving such area shall be clearly visible for
a reasonable distance to any pedestrian or motorist approaching the access or
driveway from a public or private street. Where possible and appropriate,
inter-connecting parking lots shall be provided for the purpose of reducing the
number of local trips onto public streets. All access points shall be limited
to driveway entrances and exits specified in parking area plans as approved by
the Zoning Administrator. Each required parking space shall be connected with a
deeded public right-of-way (by means of adequate aisles as required in division
(H) above), which offers adequate ingress and egress for automobiles.
      (4)   Maneuvering within property lines and the like. Parking lots,
garages and storage areas shall be so designed and constructed so that all
maneuvering into and out of each parking space takes place entirely within
property lines of lots, garages and/or storage areas.
      (5)   Striping and signage. All parking areas shall be striped to
facilitate the movement into and out of the parking stalls. This includes the
delineation of access isles and permitted turning movements. The entrances and
exits to the parking area shall be clearly marked. All signage and striping
will be adequately maintained to ensure safe and efficient movement of
vehicles.
      (6)   Drainage. All parking and loading areas shall provide for proper
and approved drainage of surface water.
      (7)   Wheel blocks. Curbs, wheel blocks or other suitable devices must be
provided to prevent vehicles from extending beyond a property line, pedestrian
walkway or drainage area. A minimum of two and one-half feet should be provided

   The amount of off-street parking space required for uses, buildings or
additions thereto shall be determined according to the following requirements,
and the space, so required, shall be stated in the application for a zoning and

located in the same building, each individual use shall be in accordance with
the off-street parking requirements of this section of the ordinance.

6.1   Use and bulk regulations
§ 6.0 OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING REGULATIONS.
   For all buildings and structures erected, altered or extended, and all uses
of land established as specified herein, after the effective date of this
ordinance, off-street loading and/or unloading facilities shall be provided as
required by the regulations herein. However, where a building permit has been
issued prior to the date of the adoption of this ordinance, and provided that
construction has not begun within 90 days of such effective date, off-street
loading and/or unloading facilities in the amounts required by this ordinance
shall prevail.
§ 6.1 USE AND BULK REGULATIONS.
   Off-street loading and/or unloading facilities shall be provided in
accordance with the following regulations.
   (A)   Spaces required.
      (1)   Every building, structure, or part thereof, erected and occupied
for manufacturing, storage, warehousing, department stores, wholesale stores,
retail stores, market, hotel, hospital, laundry, dry cleaning, dairy, mortuary
and other uses similarly involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles,
materials or merchandise and having up to 5,000 square feet of gross floor area
shall be provided with at least one loading and/or unloading space. One
additional loading and/or unloading space shall be provided for every
additional 10,000 square feet, or fraction thereof, of gross floor area in the
building.
      (2)   If sufficient proof can be shown that less than these requirements
(only that part which has to do with over 5,000 square feet) will be
satisfactory for the operation in question, the Zoning Administrator may reduce
these requirements.
   (B)   Size of off-street loading and/or unloading space. Each off-street
loading and/or unloading space shall be at least 12 feet in width and at least
60 feet in length, exclusive of aisle and maneuvering spaces and shall have a
vertical clearance of at least 14 feet; provided, however, that, when it is
demonstrated that a particular loading and/or unloading space will be used by
shorter trucks, the Zoning Administrator may reduce the minimum length to not
less than 35 feet.
   (C)   Location. All required loading and/or unloading spaces shall be
located on the same zoning lot as the use served. No loading and/or unloading
space for vehicles over two-ton capacity shall be closer than 50 feet to any
property in a residential zone unless completely enclosed by a fence, wall or
screen as regulated by
Article 8  of this ordinance. No loading and/or unloading space shall be
located in any required yards, except as herein provided.
   (D)   Access.
      (1)   Each required off-street loading and/or unloading space shall be
designed with direct access via an approved access drive, to a deeded right-of-
way which offers satisfactory ingress and egress for trucks. Access drives or
aisles shall be laid out with a width of at least 12 feet for one-way
circulation and at least 24 feet for two-way circulation.
      (2)   Off-street loading and/or unloading space shall be so designed and
constructed so that all maneuvering for loading and/or unloading can take place
entirely within the property lines of the premises. Such off-street loading
and/or unloading space shall be so located as not to hinder the free movement
of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street, road, highway or deeded
rights-of-way.
   (E)   Enlargement of buildings. The off-street loading and/or unloading
requirements, as listed in this article, shall apply at any time any building
is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding floor area.
   (F)   Design and maintenance.
      (1)   Surfacing. All open off-street loading and/or unloading spaces
shall be paved subject to the provisions in §
5.0(N)(3) of this ordinance.
      (2)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street loading and/or
unloading areas shall be in conformance with §
5.0(P)(2) of this ordinance and directed away from property in any residential
zone in such a way as not to create a nuisance.
      (3)   Space allocated to any off-street loading and/or unloading space.
Shall not be used to satisfy the space requirements for any off-street parking
facilities or portion thereof.
   (G)   Off-street loading and/or unloading plan approval required. Plans for
all loading and/or unloading facilities shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator for review and for compliance with the provisions of this
ordinance and such other pertinent ordinances of the city. Such plans shall
show the exact proposed layout of all loading and/or unloading areas, drives
and accessories, entrances and exits, type of surface to be used, typical
cross-sections of pavement, base and subbase, location of lighting facilities,
proposed grade off-street loading and/or unloading area and such other
information or plans as the circumstances may warrant.

§ 7.0 INTENT.
   To promote effective multi-modal transportation including safe and
reasonable access between public roadways and adjacent land, transit service,
bicycle and pedestrian travel. Developments intended for public use must be
planned for utilizing the appropriate design vehicle standards, as defined in
Article 2 of this ordinance.
§ 7.1 PROVISION FOR BICYCLE FACILITIES.
   (A)   The city’s Planning Commission and Kentucky Transportation Cabinet may
provide for or require bike lanes, routes or paths. Locations for potential
bicycle facilities are planned for in the city’s comprehensive plan.
   (B)   All bicycle facilities must be accompanied by appropriate pavement
markings and signage and designed according to the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) “Guide for the Development
of Bicycle Facilities”. These multi-modal facilities must be incorporated into
the design of circulation patterns of sites and in the location of access
points. Such facilities should be considered in the design of public streets by
both developers and applicable public works agency.
§ 7.2 PROVISION FOR PEDESTRIAN NETWORK.
   Sidewalk connections or alternative pedestrian ways next to adjacent
developments and/or public rights-of-way shall be provided along public roads.
New developments or re-development of existing sites shall provide sidewalks
(or alternative pedestrian ways) along public roads. Where adequate right-of-
way does not exist, right-of-way or public sidewalk easements shall be granted.
The width of the sidewalks shall be in conformance with the requirements of the
city’s subdivision regulations.
§ 7.3 PROVISIONS FOR MAINTAINING THE LEVEL OF SERVICE OF THE ROADWAY.
   The Planning Commission may required that all traffic requiring access to
and from a development shall operate in such a manner as to not adversely
affect the level of service of the roadway. Provisions for the present or
future construction of a frontage road, restriction or channelization of
turning movements, or other improvements may be required, as a condition of
approval, in order to maintain the level of service on an adjacent roadway.
§ 7.4 EXISTING ACCESS.
   Existing access points, even not in use, may not be relocated, altered or
developed without approval of the Planning Commission in accordance with § 7.5
of this ordinance.
§ 7.5 ACCESS CONTROL REGULATIONS.
   In order to promote greater safety of passage between highway and land;
improve the convenience and ease of movement of travelers on the highway;
permit reasonable speeds and economy of travel; and increase and protect the
capacity of the highway, the location and design of access points shall be in
accordance with the following access control requirements. These requirements
shall apply to all arterial and collector type streets, as identified in the
adopted comprehensive plan.
   (A)   Provision of reserved turning lanes. At those access points where
vehicles turning from the arterial and collector streets will affect the
roadway capacity, reserved turn lanes shall be constructed by the developer.
   (B)   Provision of frontage road. Where large commercial, office or
industrial developments are proposed along arterial or collector roadways, the
Planning Commission shall require the use of frontage roads to provide access
to property adjacent to these roadways in order to alleviate numerous curb cuts
and traffic congestion along these routes. In the case of smaller developments
containing single uses or buildings, or in developments where continuous road
frontage cannot be constructed due to adjacent land of separate ownership (not
included as part of the proposed development), the landowner/developer shall be
required reserve sufficient right-of-way to allow future construction of such
road. As adjacent property develops, the landowner/developer shall be required
to interconnect the individual portions of frontage roads as appropriate.
Access to roadway via an intersecting street or a common driveway may be
required if the use of a frontage road is not feasible, as may the
interconnecting parking lots.
   (C)   Coordination of access points. Major access points on opposite side of
the arterial and collector streets shall be located opposite each other;
otherwise, turning movement restrictions may be imposed by the Planning
Commission or Zoning Administrator, whichever is applicable. In addition, in
order to maximize the efficient utilization of access points, and make possible
the coordination of access with and between adjacent properties developed
(present or future) for similar uses. As a condition of approval for
construction, use or reuse of any access road, the Zoning Administrator may
require the unobstructed and unencumbered access, in accordance with the
provisions of this ordinance, be provided from any such access point to
adjacent properties.
   (D)   Spacing restrictions for signalized access points.
      (1)   Access points will warrant signalization shall be spaced a minimum
distance of one quarter mile apart. The exact location of the signal light
shall be determined by a traffic engineering study which shall at least account
for the following variables:
         (a)   Speed;
         (b)   Traffic signal phasing;
         (c)   Traffic signal cycle length;
         (d)   Roadway geometries; and
         (e)   Accident experience.
      (2)   Provision for all turning movements to maintain the design capacity
of the roadway shall be required.
   (E)   Sight distance. The location of access points shall comply with safe
distance requirements as provided in
Appendix B. The centerline of all access points shall intersect as nearly at a
90-degree angle as possible but in no case shall the angle of intersection be
less than 75 degrees or greater than 105 degrees, unless approved by the
Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator, whichever is applicable, due to
certain exceptional conditions.
   (F)   Location of unsignalized access points.
      (1)   Arterial streets.
         (a)   Unsignalized access points shall be spaced a minimum distance of
600 feet apart. Turning restrictions and/or reserved turn lanes may be
required.
         (b)   One access point per existing tract will be permitted (except in
R-RE District); however, if the spacing requirements for a direct access point
onto an arterial street (as provided in division (F)(1)(a) above) cannot be
met, then an access point may be located on a frontage road or on an
intersecting local street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing
requirements. In order for the intersecting local street or frontage road to
function properly, access onto them should be controlled as follows.
            1.   Access points onto local streets intersecting an arterial
street shall be spaced a minimum distance of 100 feet, measured from point of
curb return to point of curb return, from the arterial street.
            2.   In all areas zoned to permit commercial, industrial, or multi-
family residential use, access points from adjacent properties onto frontage
roads, shall be no less than 100 feet, measured from point of curb return to
point of curb return from intersections of the frontage road with local or
collector streets.
         (c)   Where the frontage of a tract is greater than 500 feet an
additional access point may be permitted; however, the type of access point
will depend on the spacing requirements in division (F)(1)(a) above. If the
frontage of the tract is large enough, then at least one of the access points
may have direct access onto the arterial street, provided the spacing between
the adjacent access points meet the requirements of division (F)(1)(a) above
and all other requirements of this section of the ordinance. In the case where
the frontage allows only one point of access due to spacing restrictions as
provided herein, the second access point will be via a frontage road or an
intersecting local street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing
restrictions as provided along the arterial street.
         (d)   If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the
requirements of this section of the ordinance, one access point shall be
provided. However, all such access points shall be considered a temporary
right-of-way and may be terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning
movements or caused to be relocated by the Zoning Administrator at such time as
the particular use served by the access point changes and/or the property is
otherwise provided an alternate means of access via frontage road or an
intersecting local street or sharing of a common driveway. Provisions for the
construction of a frontage road, restricted turning movements or other
improvements, may be required, as a condition to approval, in order to minimize
the number of access points and congestion to the adjacent street. In all cases
where said access points are classified as “temporary”, such designation shall
be duly noted on the plot plan or site plan submitted for a zoning permit and
also upon the deed of the property in question.
      (2)   Collector streets.
         (a)   On two-lane roadways, one access point per existing tract will
be allowed; however, if the frontage is greater than 500 feet, an additional
access point may be permitted. Furthermore, the minimum spacing between
adjacent access points on this type of facility shall be 100 feet, measured
from point of curb return to point of curb return, except in the case where the
street intersects another collector street or arterial street, then said access
points shall be spaced a minimum of 300 feet from the intersection.
         (b)   On multi-lane roadways, the spacing is dependent on whether or
not a barrier median exists (prohibiting left turn movements). If a barrier
median exists, access points may be spaced as close as 300 feet; however,
certain turning movements will be prohibited. If a barrier median does not
exist, then the minimum spacing of access points shall be 600 feet. In
addition, some turning movements may be prohibited.
         (c)   One access point per existing tract (except in R-RE District)
will be allowed; however, if the spacing requirements for a direct access
point, as provided in division (F)(2)(a) above, cannot be met, than an access
point may be located on a frontage road or on an intersecting street or share a
common driveway that meets the spacing requirements.
         (d)   If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the
requirements of this section of the ordinance, one access point shall be
provided. However, all such access points shall be considered a temporary
right-of-way and may be terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning
movements or caused to be relocated by the Zoning Administrator at such time as
the particular use served by the access point changes and/or the property is
otherwise provided an alternate means of access via a frontage road or an
intersecting local street of share a common driveway. Provisions for the
construction of a frontage road, restricted turning movements, or other
improvements, may be required, a condition to approval, in order to minimize
the number of access points and congestion to the adjacent street. In all cases
where said access points are classified as “temporary”, such designation shall
be duly noted on the plot plan or site plan submitted for a zoning permit and
also upon the deed of the property in question.
   (G)   Width of access points.
      (1)   In single-family residential zones, no access point width shall be
less than nine feet, nor more than 20 feet. In all other zones, access points
shall not be less than 12 feet, nor more than 48 feet in width. The width shall
be as measured from the point of curb return to point of curb return (or edge
of pavement if no curb exists) excluding the curb radius.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may modify (enlarge or reduce) the width
to provide for a more efficient and safe channelization and/or flow of traffic.
   (H)   Exceptions to access points requirements. Where situations develop
that may require special treatment, the requirements as provided in divisions
(A) through (G) above may be varied provided that a traffic engineering report
is prepared by a qualified traffic engineer, establishing that the special
treatment will have no adverse effects on the roadway safety and capacity.
   (I)   Access point problem areas. If after special study, it is determined
that the type of use or activity, proposed would have an adverse effect on the
safety and capacity of the adjacent roadway, the access point spacing
requirements as contained in this section, may have to be increased in order to
adequately solve the traffic movement.
   (J)   Approval of access points required.
      (1)   Plans for all access points and modifications thereto, (including
plans to use existing access points where a change of use for any tract of land
would generate more traffic than the previous use, thus producing an adverse
effect on the adjacent roadway) shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator
at a scale not less than one inch equals 100 feet. Such plans shall show the
location of all access points, and access points within 600 feet in either
direction. The proposed access point shall include typical cross-sections of
pavement, the base and subbase, proposed grade and storm drainage and such
other information or plans as the circumstances may warrant. If such access
points are being located in conjunction with off-street parking and/or loading
and unloading facilities, then said plans shall also include parking and off-
street loading and/or unloading plans, in accordance with §§
5.0 and
6.0 of this ordinance.
      (2)   All access to roadways for development purposes require site plan
or preliminary plan and improvement plan (if applicable) approval from the
Planning Commission. Access to collector and arterial roadways will only be
permitted if no other reasonable access is possible. The Planning Commission
(or Zoning Administrator where appropriate) will review development plans for
compliance with these regulations at the earliest practical stage of plan
review. These regulations shall be reviewed at the following stages unless
otherwise designated by the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator:
 
Type of Development                     Review Procedure
Conveyance plats and single-family      Zoning permit review with building
residential applications                permit
Principally permitted and conditional
uses in the Conservation, Highway
Commercial, Old Town Business,          Site plan review
Industrial, Corridor Transition Overlay
and Public Facilities Zones (where
division of property does not occur)
Subdivisions                            Preliminary plat review and, if
                                        applicable, improvement plan
 
   (K)   Approval of access points along state-maintained routes by Kentucky
Transportation Cabinet. A copy of the plans for all access points to be
constructed along a state-maintained route shall also be submitted to the
Kentucky Transportation Cabinet for review and approval during the same time as
plans are submitted to the Zoning Administrator, as provided for in division
(J) above. No access point plans shall be approved or permits issued for
construction by the Zoning Administrator, until said access point plans have
been approved by the Transportation Cabinet.
§ 7.6 CHANGE IN PROPERTY USE.
   Whenever the use of a parcel of land changes, or two or more parcels of land
are assembled under one purpose, plan, entity or usage, the existing access
permit(s) shall become void. The Planning Commission may require the
reconstruction, relocation or closure of the access point(s), based on the new
property use. Any such new or re-authorized access point must be in compliance
with all applicable sections of this regulation, and may require the submission
of a traffic study.
§ 7.7 TRAFFIC STUDIES.
   (A)   Traffic studies may be required by the Planning Commission in order to
adequately assess the impact of a development proposal on the existing and/or
planned street system. The developer bears the primary responsibility for
assessing the traffic impact associated with the proposed development while the
Planning Commission serves in a review capacity.
   (B)   The traffic study will be the responsibility of the applicant and must
be prepared by a professional individual or firm with adequate experience in
transportation engineering and planning. Upon submission of a draft traffic
study, the Planning Commission will review the study data sources, methods and
findings. Comments will be provided in a written form. The applicant/developer
will then have an opportunity to incorporate necessary revisions prior to
submitting a final report. All studies must be approved by the Planning
Commission before acceptance.
   (C)   The applicant should be notified at the development plan stage whether
a traffic study will be required; provided, adequate information is available
to the Planning Commission. If the proposed development appears to generate
significant impact on the infrastructure, the applicant will be informed that a
traffic study is required.
   (D)   Transportation consultants are required to discuss projects with the
Planning Commission prior to starting the study. Topics for discussion at these
meetings will include trip generation, directional distribution of traffic,
trip assignment, definition of the study area, intersections requiring critical
lane analysis, methods for projecting build-out volume and needs analysis of
pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Specific requirements will vary dependent upon
the specific site location being reviewed. No traffic study will be accepted
unless the traffic study requirements of this regulation are met, and the
applicant has a pre-application meeting with the Planning Commission.
   (E)   In order to facilitate consistency in traffic study reports and assist
staff in reviewing the traffic studies, the following format shall be followed
in the preparation of such facilities transportation consultants. The analysis
shall be presented in a logical sequence with footnotes where appropriate. A
detailed description of what should be incorporated into a study is detailed in
“Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development”, published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers. The following outline, taken from that

magnetic, decals or painted upon an integral part of the vehicle or equipment
as originally designed by the manufacturer, and shall not break the silhouette
of the vehicle. Such signs may indicate the name of the owner or business and
be affixed or painted onto moving vans, delivery trucks, contractors’ vehicles
and equipment, rental trucks and trailers, and the like; provided that, such
signs are clearly incidental to the use of the vehicle in conjunction with a
bona fide business and are not for the purpose of display of signs; and,
provided that, they are parked or stored in areas appropriate to their use as
vehicles, and in such a manner and location on the lot so as to minimize their
visibility from any street to the greatest extent feasible. Any sign on an
inoperable or unlicensed vehicle shall be covered so it is not visible from any
street or right-of-way.

attraction board with manually changed text) is allowed per lot of record.
         (d)   When the display message changes it must change as rapidly as
technologically practicable without any phasing, rolling, scrolling, flashing
or blending.
      FLASHING OR BLINKING SIGN. A sign, the illumination of which is not kept
constant and which contains an intermittent or sequential flashing light source
for the purpose of either attracting attention to the sign or as a method of
changing copy.
      ILLUMINATED SIGN. A sign which emits or reflects, either directly or
indirectly, artificial light from any source.
         (a)   DIRECTLY ILLUMINATED SIGN. A sign which is lighted by means of
an unshielded light source (including neon tubing) which is visible as a part
of the sign and where light travels directly from the source to the viewer’s
eye.
         (b)   INDIRECTLY ILLUMINATED SIGN. A sign whose light source is so
situated as to project light onto the exterior or front of the sign surface, or
to project light onto the building facade where the sign is located.

conducted, product sold or activity or campaign being conducted or for which no
legal owner can be found. A sign shall be deemed as ABANDONED when the
conditions described above have been in evidence for a period exceeding 180
days. For the purposes of this definition, an advertising sign shall not be
deemed ABANDONED solely because the sign has contained no copy for a period
exceeding 180 days.
      AREA OF A SIGN. Defined and computed as follows.

            2.   Any sign with three or more sign faces shall have the area
calculated by summing the area of the sign faces and dividing by two.
            3.   If the sign is composed of one or two individual cabinets, the
area around and enclosing the perimeter of each cabinet or module shall be
summed and totaled to determine the area. The perimeter of the measurable area
shall not include embellishments such as pole covers, framing, decorative
roofing and the like; provided, there is no written copy on such embellishments
and their total surface area (excluding pole covers; provided, such covers do
not extend more than six inches at any point from any structural member) does
not exceed 25% of the otherwise permitted sign area.
            4.   If the sign is composed of more than two sign cabinets, or
modules, the area enclosing the entire perimeter of all cabinets and/or modules
within a single continuous geometric figure shall be the area of the sign. The
measurable area shall not include embellishments such as pole covers, framing,
decorative roofing and the like; provided, there is no written copy on such
embellishments and their total surface area (excluding pole covers; provided,
such covers do not extend more than six inches at any point from any structural
member) does not exceed 25% of the otherwise permitted sign area.
         (b)   WALL MOUNTED SIGNS. The area shall be within a single-continuous
perimeter composed of any straight line geometric figure which encloses the
extreme limits of the copy including vertical and horizontal spacing between
individual letters, logos and the like.

it is in full compliance with the regulations of the zone in which it is
located, all applicable provisions and regulations of this ordinance or any
other applicable laws, codes or ordinances of the city. The Zoning
Administrator shall have the duty and authority to remove or cause to have

direct rays of such illumination penetrating into any residential zone or
property used for residential purposes.
   (E)   Imitation of official signage. No light, sign or other advertising
device shall be designed or erected in such a manner or location as to imitate
or resemble any official traffic sign, signal or device or use any words,

   (F)   Signs on trees, utility poles or other structures. No sign shall be
attached to or painted on the surface of any tree, utility pole, street light
standard or dilapidated structure.
   (G)   Neon signs. Neon lighting and tubing and other exposed light sources
not exceeding 100 watts per bulb may be used on signs where signs are permitted
to be directly illuminated as defined in this article. However, no such
lighting may be used to outline buildings, structures or ornamental features.
   (H)   Signs within sight triangles or right-of-way. No sign (except for
government signs) may be located within the required sight triangle of any
intersection, nor within or projecting into the public or private street right-
of-way, except as specifically permitted herein.

uses shall be permitted and shall be subject to the regulations of the zone in
which the use is located.
   (J)   Location of allowable signage based on street frontage. Where signs
are permitted on a lot on a per frontage basis under this article, such signs
shall be located and oriented to the distinct street frontage by which the sign
is permitted. In addition, for freestanding signs permitted on a lot on a per
frontage basis, the signs on that lot may not be closer than 75 feet from each
other as measured in a straight line.
   (K)   Signs as a percentage of wall area. Where wall signs are permitted as
a percentage of the wall area to which they are attached, such wall area shall
include all windows, doors and wall area of the building in one plane of
elevation. Where the building or wall face is broken or irregular in relation
to a single vertical plane perpendicular to the ground (by such architectural
features as dormers, pitched roofs, awnings and the like), the requirements may
be applied in one of two ways:
      (1)   The total building face may be considered as one, two-dimensional
wall and number of signs permitted and maximum area requirements applied on
that basis; and
      (2)   Where each individual plane created by the architectural feature
projects or is recessed by 12 inches or more, each plane may be considered as a
separate wall, and number of signs permitted and maximum area requirements
applied on that basis. However, the total square footage of the permitted signs
shall not exceed the square footage permitted above, and no sign shall be
oriented in a direction other than that of the building face under
consideration.
   (L)   Incidental signs. No incidental sign shall be attached to a
freestanding or monument advertising sign, business sign, identification sign
or directional sign.

exceeds three feet, only three feet of the vertical dimension shall be used for
computing the area of such facing, and any sign or sign cabinet permitted shall
have a maximum vertical dimension of three feet.
   (N)   Signage for multiple uses. Where more than one use occupies a
building, the permitted sign area shall be based on the building frontage of
that use.
   (O)   Permitted sign area based on frontage. Street or building frontage
used as a basis of determining permitted sign area for a building or use shall
not be used as the basis for determining the permitted sign area for another
building or use.
   (P)   Distance. No signs shall be erected, maintained, replaced, relocated,
repaired or restored within a distance of 660 feet of the right-of-way of any
interstate highways, limited access highway or turnpike, except as provided for

§ 10.7 WHERE LANDSCAPE MATERIALS ARE REQUIRED.
   This section describes the minimum requirements that shall be met in regard
to interior and perimeter landscaping for vehicular use areas, perimeter
landscaping for incompatible land use areas and landscaping for service areas.
   (A)   Perimeter landscaping requirements.
      (1)   Where vegetative and or topographic conditions that provide a
natural screening or buffer effect surrounding development, every effort shall
be made to retain such conditions; provided that, provision is made for
maintenance of such condition to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided, landscape materials shall be installed
to provide a minimum of 50% winter opacity and a 70% summer opacity, between
one foot above the finished grade level to the top of the required planting,
hedge, fence, wall or earthen mound, within four years after installation.
      (3)   Screening of all common boundaries is required, except on street
frontage. Landscape screening in these areas shall be a minimum of eight feet
in height for evergreen trees and a two-inch caliper for deciduous trees.
Evergreen trees shall have a maximum spacing of 15 feet on center. If deciduous
trees are used, they must be in conjunction with evergreen hedges that are no
less than three feet in height. The deciduous trees shall be planted a maximum
of 40 feet on center and the evergreen hedges shall be planted no more than
three feet centers. All screening areas shall be no smaller than ten feet in
width.
      (4)   In perimeter areas that are adjacent to streets, one tree shall be
provided for every 40 feet of lineal boundary. Note the following requirements
to this section. (See diagram in Appendix B.)
   (B)   Vehicular use area (VUA).
      (1)   A minimum landscape easement of four feet is required to all trees
from the edge of paving where vehicles overhang and a three feet strip that
prohibits any vehicular overhang for other areas. This area shall contain at
least one tree per 40 feet of boundary of vehicular area, plus a three feet
average height continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall or earthen mound.
      (2)   Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all portions of the
easements not occupied by other landscape material.
      (3)   For vehicular sales displays, the vehicles in the display area
shall be located behind a 12-inch height planting and all vehicles shall be
parked at grade. Screening requirements for the remaining vehicular use areas
that adjoin street frontage shall be similar to those for other uses with two
exceptions: the size of trees at installation is increased; and the spacing
between trees is reduced. These requirements are intended to help mitigate the
glare from artificial light.
   (C)   Interior landscape areas.
      (1)   All trees having a trunk diameter of six inches or greater as
measured 24 inches from ground level shall be preserved unless such trees are
exempt as follows:
         (a)   Trees within public rights-of-way or utility easements;
         (b)   Trees within the ground coverage of proposed structures or
within 12 feet from the perimeter of such structures;
         (c)   Trees within the driveway access to parking or service areas or
proposed areas to service; and
         (d)   Trees that in the judgment of a qualified forester,
horticulturist and the like are damaged, over-mature, diseased or interfere
with utility lines or are inappropriate or undesirable species for the
particular location.
      (2)   Any trees removed under the provisions of (C)(1)(d) above shall be
replaced with new tree plantings on a one to one (1:1) basis.
      (3)   Landscaping of parking lots for more than 20 vehicles shall include
landscaping equal to 10% of the parking lot areas. The landscaping areas shall
have a minimum dimension of six feet and be distributed throughout the parking
lot.
      (4)   Trees shall have a clear trunk of at least five feet above the
ground and the remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs, groundcover or
grass, not exceeding two feet in height.
      (5)   Trees in this area shall be a minimum of two inches in caliper.
      (6)   Any service structure or accessory use shall be screened whenever
abutting any Residential Zone, Professional Office Zone or when located on
property that abuts public rights-of-way. Structures may be grouped together,
however, screening height requirements shall be based upon the tallest
structure. A continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall or earthen mound, which
would enclose any service structure on all sides unless such structure must be
frequently moved, in which case screening on all, but one side is required. The
average height of the screening material shall be equal to the height of the
tallest structure.
§ 10.8 LANDSCAPE MATERIALS.
   (A)   Plants. All plants are to be living and be acceptable to the Hardiness
Zones applicable to the city area.

feet of clear wood in areas which have visibility requirements, except at
vehicular use area intersections where eight feet clear wood requirements shall
control. A minimum of ten feet overall height or a minimum caliper (measured
six inches above ground for trees up to four- inch caliper) of at least two
inches immediately after installation shall be required. Trees of species whose
roots are known to cause damage to public roadways or other public works shall
not be planted closer than 15 feet to such public works, unless the tree root
system is completely contained within a barrier. The barrier should have a
minimum interior being five feet square and five feet deep and for which the
construction requirements shall be four-inch thick reinforced concrete. (A
listing of acceptable deciduous trees can be found in Appendix B. Unacceptable
plant materials are listed in Appendix C.)
   (D)   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet high
with a minimum caliper of two inches immediately after planting, unless
otherwise noted herein.

or dead plant material shall be replaced within one year or by the next
planting period, whichever comes first, while other defective landscape
material shall be replaced or repaired within three months.
   (B)   In instances where conditions do not permit immediate planting, and a
conditional certificate of occupancy is requested to be issued, the owner or
developer may furnish to the city a bond in the equal to 150% of the estimated
cost of all materials and labor of all required planting, regardless of how
much planting remains to be done. The required bond must be in the form of
cash, cashier’s check, certified check or irrevocable letter of credit from an
acceptable banking institution, all payable to the city’s Planning and Zoning
Commission. The cost estimated is to be prepared by the Zoning Administrator
using prevailing material and labor costs. Upon receipt of the bond, a
temporary certificate of occupancy shall be issued; provided, all other
applicable codes are met. All planting must be installed and approved within
three months from the date the temporary certificate of occupancy is issued, or
the bond will be forfeited to the city, and the certificate of occupancy shall
be revoked.

Building permits issued in conformance with the Building Code of the city prior
to the date of adoption of this ordinance, whether consistent or inconsistent
with this ordinance, shall be valid for a period of 180 consecutive calendar
days from the time of issuance of the permit. If construction in connection
with such a permit has not been started within such a 180 consecutive calendar

permits, zoning permits and building permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Zoning Administrator and/or Building Inspector
authorized only the use, arrangement and construction set forth in such

construction. Use, arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized
shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and punishable as provided by §
13.9 of this ordinance.
§ 13.3 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   It shall be unlawful for an owner to use or permit the use of any building
or premises or part thereof, hereafter created, changed, converted or enlarged,

the building permit, shall have been issued by the Building Inspector. Such
certificate shall show that such building or premises or part thereof and the
proposed use thereof are in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to issue a certificate of
occupancy; provided that, he or she has checked and is satisfied that the

ordinance and the Building Code. No permit for excavation or construction shall
be issued by the Building Inspector before he or she is satisfied that the
plans, specifications and intended use conform to the provisions of this

of land and buildings shall be filed with the Building Inspector by the owner
or lessee of the land or building occupied by such non-conforming uses within

Failure to apply for such a certificate of occupancy will place upon the owner
and lessee the entire burden of proof that such use of land or buildings
lawfully existed on the effective date of this ordinance.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to issue a certificate
of occupancy for lawful non-conforming uses upon application and such
certificate shall identify the intent to which the non- conforming uses exist
at the time of issuance of such certificate.
§ 13.6 DENIAL OF CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   Except as herein stated, a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued
unless the proposed use of a building or land conforms to the applicable
provisions of this ordinance and to plans for which the building permit was

§ 13.10 INTENT CONCERNING DETERMINATIONS INVOLVED IN ADMINISTRATION AND
ENFORCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   It is the intent of this ordinance that:
   (A)   Where investigation(s) can be made by the Zoning Administrator or
other designated city employee(s), at the request of the Zoning Administrator,
using equipment normally available to the city, such investigation shall be so
made before notice of violation is issued.
   (B)   Where technical complexity, non-availability of equipment or
extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable, in the opinion of the Zoning
Administrator for the city to maintain the personnel or equipment necessary for
making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures shall be established
for:
      (1)   Causing corrections in apparent violations of performance
standards;
      (2)   Protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable
administration and enforcement of performance standard regulations; and
      (3)   Protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for
administration and enforcement.
   (C)   If the Zoning Administrator finds, after investigations have been made
by qualified experts, that there is a violation of the performance standards,
he or she shall take or cause to be taken lawful action to cause correction to,
within limits set by such performance standards.
§ 13.11 DUTIES OF ZONING ADMINISTRATOR REGARDING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   If, in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, there is probable violation
of the performance standards as set forth in Article 11 of this ordinance or
other such standards as specified throughout the zoning ordinance, the
following procedures shall be followed.
   (A)   (1)   The Zoning administrator shall give written notice, by
registered mail or certified mail, to the person or persons responsible for the
alleged violation. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged
violation and the reasons why the Zoning Administrator believes there is a
violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged
violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator within 30 consecutive
calendar days of receipt of such notification.
      (2)   However, the following alleged violations shall require an answer
or correction of the alleged violations to the satisfaction of the Zoning

3.7 of this ordinance).
      (3)   The notice shall state that failure to reply or to correct the
alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator within 30
consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice constitutes admission of
violation of the terms of this ordinance.
   (B)   The notice shall further state that, upon request of those to whom
said notice is directed, a technical investigation will be made by a qualified
expert or experts and that, if violations as alleged are found, costs of such
investigations shall be charged against those responsible for the violations,
in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but if it is
determined that no violation exists, the cost of the investigation will be paid
by the city.
   (C)   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days (or five
consecutive calendar days, as applicable) of receipt of said notice, but the
alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator,
he or she shall note “violation corrected” on his or her copy of the notice,
and shall retain it among his or her official records, taking such other action
as may he or she warranted.
   (D)   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days (or five
consecutive calendar days, as applicable) of receipt of said notice and the
alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator within the established time limit, he or she shall proceed to
take or cause to be taken such action as is warranted by continuation of a
violation after notice to cease in accordance with KRS 100.337 or may refer the
case to the city’s Code Enforcement Board in accordance with §§
13.14 and
13.15 of this ordinance.
   (E)   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days (or five
consecutive calendar days, as applicable) of receipt of said notice, but the
alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator,
but requesting additional time, the Zoning Administrator may grant a reasonable
extension of time if he or she deems it warranted under the particular
circumstances of the case and if the extension will not, in his or her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life, health or property.
   (F)   (1)   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days (or
five consecutive calendar days, as applicable) of receipt of said notice
requesting a technical determination of the alleged violations, and if the
alleged violations continue, the Zoning Administrator may call in properly
qualified experts to investigate and determine whether the violation exists or
may advise the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation that he,
she or they may retain qualified experts, at his, her or their own expense, to
investigate and determine whether the violations exist.
      (2)   The findings of the experts, if any, shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator to determine, in his or her opinion, whether there are
violations based upon the findings presented to him or her. If the findings
indicate violations of the performance standards, the persons responsible for
the violations shall be notified by the Zoning Administrator and may be subject
to the penalties as may be appropriate under terms of §
13.9 of this ordinance.
      (3)   If the Zoning Administrator determines that no violation exists,
the person or persons shall be promptly notified by the Zoning Administrator
that no violations exist.
   (G)   (1)   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days (or
five consecutive calendar days as applicable) of receipt of said notice
requesting a technical determination of the alleged violations, and if the
alleged violations continue, the Zoning Administrator may call in properly
qualified expert to investigate and determine whether violations exist.
      (2)   If expert findings indicate violations of the standards, the costs
of the investigations shall be assessed against the properties or persons
responsible for the violations in addition to such other penalties as may be
appropriate under the terms of §
13.9 of this ordinance.
      (3)   If no violation is found, the costs of the investigations shall be
paid by the city without assessment against the properties or persons involved.

substantiation for such action and the submission of a written report as
required in division (E) above. A tie vote shall be subject to further
consideration by the Planning Commission for a period not to exceed 30 days, at
the end of which if the tie has not been broken, the application shall be
forwarded to the City Council without a recommendation of approval or
disapproval.

zoning map amendment whenever the Planning Commission forwards the application
to the City Council without a recommendation of approval or disapproval due to
a tie vote. Unless a majority of the entire City Council votes to override the
Planning Commission’s recommendation, such recommendation shall become final

         (a)   Application for a zoning amendment shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator as required by division (A) above and shall include a
development plan in accordance with the applicable requirements of §
3.20(A) of this ordinance. The Zoning Administrator may waive the submission of
such data involving detailed engineering study until such time as the zoning
amendment has been granted. Pursuant to KRS 100.203(5), (6) and (7), at the
time of filing an application for a zoning map amendment, an applicant may
elect to have any variances or conditional use permits for the same development
to be heard and finally decided by the Planning Commission at the same public
hearing set for the map amendment, or by the Board of Adjustment as otherwise
provided for in this ordinance and KRS Chapter 100. If the applicant elects to
so have any variances or conditional use permits to be heard and finally
decided by the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission shall assume all
powers and duties otherwise exercised by the Board of Adjustment pursuant to
KRS 100.231, 100.233, 100.237, 100.241, 100.243, 100.247 and 100.251. Any

approval or disapproval, in accordance with division (G) above.
      (2)   Expiration. The zoning map amendment shall be subject to the time
constraints as noted below. Upon expiration of said time period and any
extensions thereto, the City Council may initiate a request for a public
hearing by the Planning Commission, in accordance with the requirements of KRS
Chapters 100 and 147, for the purpose of determining whether said zoning map
amendment should revert to its original designation. A public hearing may be
initiated if substantial construction has not been initiated within a period of
12 consecutive months from the date of approval of the map amendment by the
City Council; provided that, an extension may be permitted upon approval of the
City Council or its duly authorized representative, if sufficient proof can be
demonstrated that the construction was delayed due to circumstances beyond the
applicant’s control, and that prevailing conditions have not changed
appreciably to render the approved development plan obsolete. The amount of
construction that constitutes initiating substantial construction shall be as
approved in the development plan by the Planning Commission.
§ 14.1 RESTRICTIONS ON RE-SUBMITTALS OF ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS.
   After a request or application for an amendment to the zoning map has been
denied as a final action by the city, the property owner, option holder or
other person having an interest in the property shall not be permitted to
reapply for the same map amendment and/or submit the same development plan for
one year from the date of such denial. This one-year restriction shall also
apply where the city takes no action and the last action taken is the
recommendation from the Commission of denial for the zoning map amendment
proposal and the person making the request has not asked the legislative body
to take further action or denial of the application is by operation of law per
KRS 100.211.

opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by a court of record on application, or on
notice to the Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken and on due
cause shown.
§ 15.5 POWERS OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   Upon appeals, the Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
   (A)   To hear and decide on applications for variances where, by reason of
the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or unusual shape of a site on the
effective date of this ordinance, or by reason of exceptional topographic
conditions, or some other extraordinary situation or condition of that site,
the literal enforcement of the requirements (height or width of building or
size of yards, but not population density) of the zoning ordinance would
deprive the applicant or reasonable capacity to make use of the land;
   (B)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged, by the appellant, that
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by
a Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this ordinance. Such appeal shall
be taken within 30 consecutive calendar days;
   (C)   To hear and decide applications for conditional use permits to allow
the proper integration into the community of uses which are specifically named
herein which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone only if
certain conditions are met as specified in §
3.15 of this ordinance;
   (D)   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this
ordinance, requests for interpretation of the official zoning map or for
decisions upon other special questions upon which said Board is authorized to
act upon; and
   (E)   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this
ordinance and the adopted comprehensive plan for the city, requests for the
change from one non-conforming use to another.
§ 15.6 VARIANCES; CHANGE FROM ONE NON-CONFORMING USE TO ANOTHER; CONDITIONS
GOVERNING APPLICATIONS; PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Variances. Before any dimensional variance is granted, the Board of
Adjustment must find all of the following, which shall be recorded along with
any imposed conditions or restrictions in its minutes and records and issued in
written form to the applicant to constitute proof of the dimensional variance.
Such variance shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
      (1)   A written application for a dimensional variance (including the
required fee) and a site plan, if applicable, subject to the applicable
requirements of §
3.21 of this ordinance, are submitted and the Board must find that the granting
of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety of welfare,
will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will not cause
a hazard or a nuisance to the public, and will not allow an unreasonable
circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In making these
findings, the Board shall consider whether:
         (a)   The requested variance arises from special circumstances which
do not generally apply to land in the general vicinity, or in the same zone;
         (b)   The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would
deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land or would create an
unnecessary hardship on the applicant; and
         (c)   The circumstances are the result of actions of the applicant
taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is
sought; and
         (d)   The Board shall deny any request for a variance arising from
circumstances that are the result of willful violations of the zoning
regulation by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation
form which relief is sought.
      (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with §
15.2 of this ordinance;
      (3)   The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in person,
or by agent, or by attorney;
      (4)   Prior to granting a dimensional variance:
         (a)   The Board of Adjustment shall further make the following
findings when granting a variance;
         (b)   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of variance and that
the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use
of the land, building or structure; and
         (c)   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this ordinance as well as the adopted comprehensive plan for the city, and
will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise, detrimental to the
public welfare.
      (5)   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this ordinance.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
ordinance and punishable under §§
13.9 and
13.15 of this ordinance.
   (B)   Variance cannot contradict zoning regulation. The Board of Adjustment
shall not possess the power to grant variance to permit use of any land,
building or structure which is not permitted by this ordinance in the zone in
question, or to alter density requirements in the zone in question.
   (C)   Variance runs with land. A variance applies to the property for which
it is granted and not to the individual who applied for it. A variance also
runs with the land and is transferable to any future owner of land, but it
cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different site. Approval for a
variance shall automatically terminate if a building permit has not been
obtained within 60 calendar days after the date of the Board of Adjustment
approval in order to implement the variance. The Board may extend the time
limit within which to obtain a building permit; however, in no case shall said
time be longer than six months.
   (D)   Change from one non-conforming use to another.
      (1)   A non-conforming use shall not be changed to another non-conforming
use without the specific approval of the Board of Adjustment, as provided
herein.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide on
applications to convert or change an existing non-conforming use to another
non-conforming use, subject to the following:
         (a)   A written application for a change from one nonconforming use to
another (including the required fee) and a development plan or site plan, if
applicable, subject to the applicable requirements of §§
3.20 or
3.21, shall be submitted to the Board;
         (b)   Notice of the public hearing shall be given in accordance with §
15.2 of this ordinance;
         (c)   The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in
person, by agent or by attorney;
         (d)   Prior to granting a change from one non-conforming use to
another, the Board of Adjustment shall find that the new nonconforming use is
in the same or more restrictive classification of use as the prior non-
conforming use, the applicant shall establish and the Board of Adjustment shall
find:
            1.   The new non-conforming use shall generate less vehicular
traffic (automobile and truck) than the prior non-conforming use;
            2.   The new non-conforming use is of a nature which will emit less
noise and air pollution than the prior non-conforming use; and
            3.   The new non-conforming use will be more in character with the
existing neighborhood than the prior non-conforming use, in that it is more in
conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan of the city and, also, more in
conformance with the uses permitted in the zone in which the use is located,
than the prior non-conforming use.
         (e)   Any change of non-conforming use granted by the Board of
Adjustment shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance, including, but
not limited to: parking requirements; sign regulations and yard requirements;
and all other pertinent ordinances of the city;
         (f)   The Board of Adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or
extension of a non-conforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at
which time its use became non- conforming;
         (g)   The Board of Adjustment, in granting a change of non-conforming
uses, may attach such conditions thereto as it may deem necessary and proper;
and the action, limitations and conditions imposed, if any, shall be in
writing, directed to the applicant, with a copy to be furnished to the Zoning
Administrator;
         (h)   The change of non-conforming use as may be granted by the Board
of Adjustment applies to the property for which it is granted and not to the
individual who applied and, therefore, cannot be transferred by the applicant
to a different property; and
         (i)   In the case where the change of non-conforming use has not
occurred within one year after the date of granting thereof, said use shall be
governed according to the requirements of §
3.13(B)(3) of this ordinance.
§ 15.7 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (A)   Conditional use permits shall not be issued without the specific
approval of the Board of Adjustment, as provided herein.
   (B)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide on
applications for conditional use permits, subject to the following:
      (1)   A written application for a conditional use permit (including the
required fee) shall be submitted to the Board;
      (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with §
15.2 of this ordinance;
      (3)   The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in person,
or by agent or by attorney;
      (4)   Prior to granting a conditional use permit, the Board of Adjustment
shall find that the application for a conditional use permit meets the
requirements of this ordinance, §
3.15; and
      (5)   Approval for a conditional use shall automatically terminate if a
building permit has not been obtained within 60 calendar days after the date of
the Board of Adjustment approval in order to implement the conditional use. The
Board may extend the time limit within which to obtain a building permit;
however, in no case shall said time be longer than six months.
§ 15.8 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   In exercising the aforementioned powers, the Board of Adjustment may,
so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this ordinance,
reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements,
decision or determination as made by the Zoning Administrator, from whom the
appeal is taken.
   (B)   A simple majority of the total membership of the Board of Adjustment
as established by regulation or agreement, shall be necessary to reverse any
order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator, or
to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to
pass under this ordinance, or to effect any variation in the application of
this ordinance.
   (C)   The details of the decision of the Board shall be forwarded to the
Zoning Administrator.
§ 15.9 DECISIONS OF THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   Upon petition by an applicant, the Zoning Administrator may waive or
modify the standards governing the placement of certain appurtenant structures
within a residential property.
   (B)   For the purpose of this section, appurtenant structures shall be
limited to swimming pools, porches, decks and utility sheds (smaller than 100
square feet).
   (C)   Applicants shall request such consideration in writing, stating the
nature of the request and reasons for the need for a modification or waiver.
   (D)   All decisions of the Zoning Administrator shall be rendered, in
writing, within ten working days of receipt of a petition, and after
consultation with all adjoining property owners. Decisions shall be forwarded
to the Planning Commission and the Board of Adjustment.
   (E)   The Zoning Administrator, at his or her discretion, may refer a
petition to the Board of Adjustment for action without recommendation.
APPENDIX A: BIG-BOX RETAIL DESIGN STANDARDS
§ I PROCEDURE.
   The following guidelines are intended to be used as a design aid by
developers proposing large retail developments and as an evaluation tool by the
Planning Commission in its review processes. These guidelines shall apply to
all projects, which are processed according to the criteria for proposed
development plans and to all projects for retail establishments of more than
50,000 square feet. These guidelines are to be used in conjunction with the
city’s subdivision regulations and the city’s zoning ordinance.
§ II DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this Appendix A, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly requires a different meaning.
   ARCADE. An area contiguous to a street or plaza that is open and
unobstructed, and that is accessible to the public at all times. ARCADES may
include building columns, landscaping, statuary and fountains. ARCADES do not
include off-street loading/unloading areas, driveways or parking areas.
   ARTICULATE. To give emphasis to or distinctly identify a particular element.
An ARTICULATED FACADE would be the emphasis of elements on the face of a wall
including a change in setback, materials, roof pitch or height.
   AS-OF-RIGHT ZONING. Uses and development standards that are determined in
advance and specifically authorized by the zoning regulations (e.g., a single-
family zone would allow single-family housing as of right so long as site
development standards are met). This type of zoning is in contrast to
cumulative or “pyramidal” zoning.
   BERM. An earthen mound designed to provide visual interest on a site, screen
undesirable views, reduce noise or provide a buffer from adjoining uses.
   BREEZEWAY. A structure for the principal purpose of connecting a main
building or structure on a property with other buildings.
   BUFFER. See also SCREEN. An area provided to reduce the conflict between two
different land uses. BUFFERS are intended to mitigate undesired views, noise
and glare - effectively providing greater privacy to neighboring land uses.
Typical BUFFERS consist of materials that serve this purpose and include, but
are not limited to, plant materials, walls, fences and/or significant land area
to separate the uses.
   BUFFER STRIP. A portion of a lot or property used to visually separate one
use from another through the use of vegetation, distance or other approved
method.
   BUILDING FACE, FRONT. Any building face, which can be touched by a line
drawn perpendicular to street (public or private).
   BUILDING FACE, PUBLIC. Any building side which is visible from public or
private rights-of- way and/or the faces that contain public entry.
   BUILDING MASS. The building’s expanse or bulk and is typically used in
reference to structures of considerable size.
   DESIGN GUIDELINES. Statements and graphics intended to direct the planning
and development of the built environment in a particular manner or style so
that the end result contributes positively to the overall development.
   DORMER. A window set vertically in a gable projecting from a sloping roof.
   FACADE. The portion of any exterior elevation on the building extending from
grade to the top of the parapet, wall or eaves and extending the entire length
of the building.
   FRONT YARD. The portion of the front yard extending the full width of the
lot and measured between the front lot line and a parallel line across the
front of the building. Corner and double lots shall adhere to the front yard
setback(s) for each frontage.
   GABLE. A triangular wall section at the end of a pitched roof, bounded by
the two roof slopes.
   HIP ROOF. Roof without gables.
   PARAPET. The portion of a wall that extends above the roofline.
   PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Development designed with an emphasis primarily on the street
sidewalk and on pedestrian access to the site and buildings/structures rather
than on auto access. The buildings/structures are generally located close to
the public or private right-of-way and the main entrance(s) is oriented to the
street sidewalk.
      (2)   There are generally windows or display cases along building
facades. Although parking is provided, it is generally limited in size and
location.
   PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY. A surfaced walkway, separate from the traveled portion
of a public or private right-of-way or parking lot/driving aisle.
   PORTICO. A porch or walkway with a roof supported by columns, often leading
to the entrance to a building.
   PUBLIC/PRIVATE RIGHT-OF-WAY. Any public or private road, access easement
intended to provide public access to any lot/development, but excluding any
service road or internal driving aisles (i.e., within parking lots).
   SCREEN. See also BUFFER. The sole purpose of a screen is to block views. A
SCREEN should be constructed of opaque materials and whose height will be
effective in obstructing unwanted views.
   SETBACK. A prescribed distance or an area between one element and another
(i.e., a building and the road right-of-way). Within these guidelines, the term
also refers to:
      (1)   The minimum distance and the area measured from the property line
to the interior of a parcel where buildings may be constructed;
      (2)   The required distance and the area between the edge of the parking
lot pavement/curb and the property line or buildings/structures; and
      (3)   Placing a building face on a line to the rear of another building
line.
   STREETSCAPE. All elements of a development or area that are in view from
other points along a street.
§ III DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Article I - Aesthetic Character.
      (1)   Facades and exterior walls.
         (a)   Intent. Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive
scale and the uniform, impersonal appearances of large retail buildings and
provide visual interest that will be consistent with the community’s identity
character and scale. The intent is to encourage a more human scale so that
residents will be able to identify with their community. The resulting scale
will ensure a greater likelihood of reuse of structure by subsequent tenants.
         (b)   Guideline. Developments with facade over 100 feet in linear
length shall incorporate wall projections or recesses a minimum of three-foot
depth and a minimum of 20 contiguous feet within each 100 feet of facade length
and shall extend over 20% of the facade. Developments shall use animating
features such as arcades, display windows, entry areas or awnings along at
least 60% of the facade.

      (2)    Smaller retail stores.
         (a)   Intent. The presence of smaller retail stores gives a center a
“friendlier” appearance by creating variety, breaking up large expanses, and
expanding the range of the site’s activities. Windows and window displays of
such stores should be used to contribute to the visual interest of exterior
facades. The standards presented in this section are directed toward those
situations where additional, smaller stores, with separate, exterior customer
entrances are located in the principal buildings or development site.
         (b)   Guideline. Where principal buildings contain additional,
separately owned stores, which occupy less than 50,000 square feet of gross
floor area, with separate, exterior customer entrances.
            1.   The street level facade of such stores shall be transparent
between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for no
less than 60% of the horizontal length of the building facade of such
additional stores.
            2.   Windows shall be recessed and should include visually
prominent sills, shutters or other such forms of framing.
      (3)   Detail features.
         (a)   Intent. Buildings should have architectural features and
patterns that provide visual interests, at the scale of the pedestrian, reduce
massive aesthetic effects and recognize local character. The elements in the
following standard should be integral parts of the building fabric, and not
superficially applied trim or graphics, or paint.
         (b)   Guideline. Building facades shall include a repeating pattern
that shall include no less than three of the elements listed below. At least
one of these elements shall repeat horizontally. All elements shall repeat at
intervals of no more than 30 feet, either horizontally or vertically:
            1.   Color change;
            2.   Texture change;
            3.   Material module change; and
            4.    Expression of architectural or structural bay through a
change in plane no less than 12 inches in width, such as an offset, reveal or
projecting rib.

      (4)   Roofs.
         (a)   Intent. Variations in roof lines should be used to add interest
to, and reduce the massive scale of, large buildings. Roof features should
compliment the character of adjoining neighborhoods.
         (b)   Guideline.
            1.   Roof lines shall be varied with a change in height every 100
linear feet in the building length.
            2.   Parapets, mansard roofs, gable roofs, hip roofs or dormers
shall be used to conceal flat roofs and roof top equipment from public view.
            3.    Alternating lengths and designs may be acceptable and can be
addressed during the preliminary development plan.

      (5)    Materials and colors.
         (a)   Intent. Exterior building materials and colors comprise a
significant part of the visual impact of a building. Therefore, they should be
aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and colors used in
adjoining neighborhoods.
         (b)   Guideline.
            1.   Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality
materials. These include, without limitation:
               a.   Brick;
               b.   Wood;
               c.   Sandstone;
               d.   Other native stone; and
               e.   Tinted, textured, concrete masonry units.
            2.   Facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral or
earth tone colors. The use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, black or
fluorescent colors is prohibited.
            3.   Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors,
including primary colors, but neon tubing shall not be an acceptable feature
for building trim or accent areas.
            4.   Predominant exterior building materials as well as accents
should not include the following:
               a.   Smooth-faced concrete block;
               b.   Tilt-up concrete panels; and
               c.   Pre-fabricated steel panels.
      (6)   Entryways.
         (a)   Intent. Entryway design elements and variations should give
orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the building. The standards
identify desirable entryway design features.
         (b)   Guideline. Each principal building on a site shall have clearly
defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring no less than three of the
following:
            1.   Canopies or porticos;
            2.   Overhangs;
            3.   Recesses/projections;
            4.   Arcades;
            5.   Raised corniced parapets over the door;
            6.   Peaked roof forms;
            7.   Arches;
            8.   Outdoor patios;
            9.   Display windows;
            10.   Architectural details, such as tile work and moldings which
are integrated into the building structure and design; and
            11.   Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped
areas and/or places for sitting.

   (B)    Article II - Site Design and Relationship to the Surrounding
Community.
      (1)    Entrances.
         (a)   Intent.
            1.    Large retail buildings should feature multiple entrances.
            2.   Multiple building entrances reduce walking distances from
cars, facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access from public sidewalks, and
provide convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual stores,
or identified departments in a store.
            3.   Multiple entrances also mitigate the effect of the unbroken
walls and neglected areas that often characterize building facades that face
bordering land uses.
         (b)   Guideline.
            1.   All sides of a principal building that directly face an
abutting public or private right-of-way shall feature at least one customer
entrance. Where a principal building directly faces more than two abutting
public or private rights-of-way, this requirement shall apply only to two sides
of the building, including the side of the building facing the primary street,
and another side of the building facing a secondary street.
            2.   The number of entrances for the principal building shall be
addressed at the preliminary development plan stage. Where additional stores
will be located in the principal building, each such store shall have at least
one exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the above requirements.

      (2)    Parking lot orientation.
         (a)   Intent. Parking areas should provide safe, convenient and
efficient access for vehicles and pedestrians. They should be distributed
around large buildings in order to shorten the distance to other buildings and
public sidewalks and to reduce the overall scale of the paved surface. If
buildings are located closer to streets, the scale of the complex is reduced,
pedestrian traffic is encouraged and architectural details take on added
importance.
         (b)   Guideline. No more than 60% of the off-street parking area for
the entire property shall be located between the front facade within the front
yard of the principal building(s) and the primary abutting street unless the
principal building(s) and/or parking lots are screened from view by outlot
development (such as restaurants) and additional tree plantings and/or berms.
      (3)   Back and sides.
         (a)   Intent. The rear or sides of buildings often present an
unattractive view of blank walls, loading areas, storage areas, HVAC units,
garbage receptacles and other such features. Architectural and landscaping
features should mitigate these impacts. Any back or side of a building visible
from a public or private right-of-way shall be built in accordance with
division (A) above (Article I of this appendix). The Planning Commission may
waive this requirement as part of the development plan.
         (b)   Guideline. The minimum setback for any building facade shall be
in accordance with the zoning ordinance. Where the facade faces adjacent
residential uses an earthen berm shall be installed, no less than six feet in
height, containing at a minimum, a double row of evergreen or deciduous trees
planted at intervals of 15 feet on center. Additional landscaping may be
required by the Planning Commission to effectively buffer adjacent land use as
deemed appropriate. All additional landscape requirements of the zoning
ordinance shall apply.
      (4)   Outdoor storage, trash collection and loading areas.
         (a)   Intent. Loading areas and outdoor storage areas exert visual and
noise impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. These areas, when visible from
adjoining properties and/or public streets, should be screened, recessed or
enclosed. While screens and recesses can effectively mitigate these impacts,
the selection of inappropriate screening materials can exacerbate the problem.
Appropriate locations for loading and outdoor storage areas include areas
between buildings, where more than one building is located on a site and such
buildings are not more than 40 feet apart, or on those sides of buildings that
do not have customer entrances.
         (b)   Guideline.
            1.   Areas for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection or
compaction, loading or other such uses shall not be visible from public or
private rights-of-way.
            2.   No areas for outdoor storage, trash collection or compaction,
loading or other such uses shall be located within 20 feet of any public or
street, public sidewalk or internal pedestrian way.
            3.   Loading docks, truck parking, outdoor storage, utility meters,
HVAC equipment, trash, dumpsters, trash compaction and other service functions
shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the
landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are
fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets,
and no attention is attracted to the functions by the use of screening
materials that are different from or inferior to the principal materials of the
building and landscape.
            4.   Non-enclosed areas for the storage and sale of seasonal
inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences.
Materials, colors and designs of screening walls and/or fences and the cover
shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors of the
building. If such areas are to be covered, then the covering shall conform to
those used as predominant materials and colors on the buildings.
            5.   Temporary sales/displays, such as Christmas trees, landscape
materials and fireworks, shall follow all outdoor requirements as described in
the zoning ordinance. Location and time/duration of such sales/displays shall
be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator or appointed designee.
      (5)   Pedestrian flows.
         (a)   Intent. Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented
developments to the neighborhood, thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling
the development to project a friendlier, more inviting image. This section sets
forth standards for public sidewalks and internal pedestrian circulation
systems that can provide user-friendly pedestrian access as well as pedestrian
safety, shelter and convenience within the center grounds.
         (b)   Guideline.
            1.   Sidewalks at least six feet in width shall be provided along
all sides of the lot that abut a public or private right-of-way, excluding the
Cumberland Parkway. The Planning Commission may waive this requirement as part
of the development plan.
            2.   Continuous internal pedestrian walkways, no less than five
feet in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to
the principal customer entrance of all principal buildings on the site. At a
minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as,
but not limited to, transit stops, street crossings, building and store entry
points and shall feature adjoining landscaped areas that include trees, shrubs,
benches, flower beds, ground covers or other such materials for no less than
50% of their length.
            3.   Sidewalks, no less than five feet in width, shall be provided
along the full length of the building along any facade featuring a customer
entrance, and along any facade abutting public parking areas. Such sidewalks
shall be located at least six feet from the facade of the building to provide
planting beds for foundation landscaping, except where features such as arcades
or entryways are part of the facade.
            4.   Internal pedestrian walkways provided in conformance with
division (B)(5)(b)2. above, shall provide weather protection features such as
awnings or arcades within 30 feet of all customer entrances, constructed
parallel to the facade of the building. This is not intended to extend into the
driving aisles or parking areas.
            5.   All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from
driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials
such as pavers, bricks or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and
comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways. Signs shall be
installed to designate pedestrian walkways.
      (6)   Central features and community spaces.
         (a)   Intent. Buildings should offer attractive and inviting
pedestrian scale features, spaces and amenities. Entrances and parking lots
should be configured to be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently
tied to logical destinations. Bus stops and drop-off/pick-up points should be
considered as integral parts of the configuration. Pedestrian ways should be
anchored by special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos,
pedestrian light fixtures, bollards, planter walls and other architectural
elements that define circulation ways and outdoor spaces. The features and
spaces should enhance the building and the center as integral parts of the
community fabric.
         (b)    Guideline. Each retail establishment subject to these standards
shall contribute to the establishment or enhancement of community and public
spaces by providing at least two of the following: patio/seating area,
pedestrian plaza with benches, transportation center, window shopping walkways,
outdoor play area, kiosk area, water feature, clock tower, steeple or other
such deliberately shaped area and/or a focal feature or amenity that, in the
judgment of the Planning Commission, adequately enhances such community and
public spaces. Any such areas shall have direct access to the public sidewalk
network and such features shall not be constructed of materials that are
inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape.

APPENDIX B: ACCEPTABLE PLANT MATERIALS AND SIGHT TRIANGLE STANDARDS
   (A)   Recommended plant materials.
      (1)   The following is designed to encourage an imaginative selection of
landscape trees. Careful selection will prevent an over-dependence on a few
species. This compilation will be useful to residents, nurserymen,
horticulturists, landscapers, developers and landscape architects. Planting and
maintaining a diverse urban forest is the goal of the city’s tree programs.
This idea is reflected in landscape plan approval by the city’s Planning
Commission.
      (2)   This list is divided into seven size categories: large trees which
mature at a height of 50 feet or more (
Group A); medium trees reaching a mature height of between 25 and 50 feet (
Group B); large shrubs or small trees which range from ten to 25 feet at
maturity (
Group C); medium shrubs reaching a mature height of between six to ten feet in
height at maturity (
Group D); small shrubs reaching a mature height of between four to six feet in
height at maturity (
Group E); low shrubs reaching a mature height of between one and one-half to
four feet in height at maturity (
Group F); and ground cover reaching a mature height below one and one-half feet
at maturity. Tree lawn sizes must accommodate the tree size planted:
Group A, greater than seven feet;
Group B, four to seven feet; and
Group C, three to four feet. Use under utility lines is limited to small trees,
although medium trees may be planted as close as ten lateral feet to utility
lines.
      (3)   The approximate mature height and diameter of each tree’s crown are
given. Trees are alphabetized by their scientific name with the common name
given. Cultivars best suited to Northern Kentucky are also provided.
      (4)   Information on each plant is divided into two categories: plant
characteristics and plant uses. Plant characteristics refer to the physical
attributes of a plant, including height, spread, form, urban tolerance, disease
and insect tolerance and density (for shrubs only). Plant uses refer to the
appropriate use of trees; this includes street trees, property perimeter trees,
vehicular use area perimeter trees, vehicular use area interior trees, as well
as use in the sight triangle, utility easements, naturalized planting in
greenspaces and possibly as a screen. Uses involving shrubs include property
perimeter screening, service area screen, as well as use in the sign triangle,
as a groundcover, and in greenspaces.
      (5)   The tolerance category presents information from various sources.
The tree’s relative tolerance to insects, diseases, pollution and soil
conditions are signified by either an “X” meaning yes, it is tolerant; or a
blank box, meaning no, it is not tolerant. Boxes marked with an “X” under
“Plant Uses” indicates that the tree or shrub is suitable for the listed uses.
      (6)   The comments pertain to any other notable characteristic of the
tree.
   (B)   Sight triangle.
      (1)   Definition. A SIGHT TRIANGLE is that area at street or drive
intersections where all landscaping is prohibited, except ground covers and
trees that are without limbs from the ground up seven feet.
      (2)   City streets. When two city streets intersect a city street, the
sight triangle shall consist of the area between points 35 feet along both
streets from the intersection of the edges of the pavement. When a driveway
intersects a city street, the sight triangle shall consist of the area between
20 feet. See Diagrams B-1 and B-2.
      (3)   State highway. Where a city street, driveway or other entrance
intersects with a state highway, the sight triangle shall consist of the area
between a point ten feet along the street or driveway edge of pavement and a
point located along the edge of the state highway pavement the distance an
automobile traveling the speed limit can go in six seconds. See Diagram B-3. An
encroachment permit from the state’s Department of Transportation is required
for any planting in the state right-of-way.

                                               The use of this tree should be tempered because of its extensive shallow

                  saccharinum                  The tree is also weak wooded which causes it to becomes a liability with
                                               age. Often becomes too large for a street tree.
                  Aesculus                     These trees are all very messy, which is caused by the large fruit and low
A/LT   No         hippocastanum Horse Chestnut rate of leaf drop. None of these trees are hardy in a restricted area and,
                                               therefore, they should not be used in an urban area.
