Ordinances. In case of any dispute as to the interpretation of any or all of
these rules and regulations, the decision of the County Judge Executive or his
agent shall be final. In performing work under these specifications, the

the project and any impact or potential impact. Permittee is responsible for
all correspondence with private property owner. This document does not give
permittee permission to perform any work on private property. All arrangements
need to be made with private property owner by the permittee. The county is not
responsible for determining the right-of-way. Where adjacent to the road, a
survey and/or proof of easement(s) will accompany the application. Public
utilities may be installed in the right-of-way. Private utilities are not
allowed in the right-of-way unless a utility service is needed. In this case,
the service line must be installed perpendicular to the road to run from the
main to the opposite side of the right-of-way. Private easement will be needed
if right-of-way is not available. A private utility needs a private easement
even if a public right-of-way is available. Private borings under the road will
be the responsibility of the private owner to maintain.

made by April 15 of each year , except returns made on a fiscal year , which
shall be made by the 15th day of the fourth month  following the close of the
fiscal year . The County shall supply blank forms for returns. In the event the
federal government extends the filing deadline for federal tax returns for the
preceding  taxable year from April 15 of each year to a later date, all
business entity returns for the preceding  taxable year shall be made by the
same date set by the federal government as the deadline for filing federal tax
returns.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its
occupational license tax return with the county . Whenever, in the opinion of
the county , it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return of any
business entity in order to audit the return , the county  may compel the
business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and
schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed. The county
 may also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the federal
government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns, and comply with rules as the county from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the county deems it necessary, the county  may require
a business entity , by notice served to the business entity , to make a return
, render statements under oath , or keep records, as the county deems
sufficient to determine the tax liability the business entity .
   (D)   The county  may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the
taxable income of any business entity , the attendance of a representative of
the business entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity , as
appears from the face of the return , shall be paid to the county at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return , determined without
regard to any extension of time for filing the return .
   (F)   Every business entity making payments of $600 or more to persons or
business entities for services performed within the county is responsible for
maintaining the records of those payments and for completing IRS Form 1099 on
or before February 28 of the year  following the close of the calendar year in
which such compensation was paid and to remit copies of the IRS Form 1099 or
equivalent information to the county on or before February 28 of each year .
   (G)   The county  may grant any business entity an extension of not more
than six months , unless a longer extension has been granted by the Internal
Revenue Service or is agreed to by the county and the business entity , for
filing its return , if the business entity , on or before the date prescribed
for payment of the occupational license tax, requests the extension and pays
the amount properly estimated as its tax.
   (H)   If the time for filing a return is extended, the business entity shall
pay, as part of the tax, an amount equal to 12% per annum simple interest on
the tax shown due on the return , but not been previously paid, from the time
the tax was due until the return is actually filed and the tax paid to the
county . A fraction of a month is counted as an entire month .
   (I)   Except as provided in division (L) of this section, net profit shall
be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district , by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (J) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (K) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district , by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (K) of this section.
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (I) through (L) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the county .
   (J)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the county during the tax period by the business
entity for compensation , and the denominator of which is the total
compensation paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax
period. Compensation is paid or payable in the county based on the time the
individual’s service is performed within the county .
   (K)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the county during the tax period, and
the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
county if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
county regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the county and the purchaser is the
United States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues , other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the county based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the county and
the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-
producing activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (L)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the county , the
business entity  may petition the county or the county  may require, in respect
to all or any part of the business entity's  business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity's  business activity in the county ; or

§ 110.24 BUSINESS NET PROFIT RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee shall
deduct and withhold upon the payment of compensation an occupational license
tax calculated under §
110.22 of this chapter imposed against the compensation by the county . Amounts
withheld shall be paid to the county in accordance with this chapter. In the
event the federal government extends the filing deadline for federal tax
returns for the preceding taxable year from April 15 of each year to a later
date, all business entity returns for the preceding taxable year shall be made
by the same date set by the federal government as the deadline for filing
federal tax returns.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its
occupational license tax return with the county . Whenever, in the opinion of
the county , it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return of any
business entity in order to audit the return , the county  may compel the
business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and
schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed. The county
 may also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the federal
government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns , and comply with rules as the county from time to
time may prescribe. Whenever the county deems it necessary, the county  may
require a business entity , by notice served to the business entity , to make a
return , render statements under oath , or keep records, as the county deems
sufficient to determine the tax liability the business entity .
   (D)   The county  may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the
taxable income of any business entity , the attendance of a representative of
the business entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity , as
appears from the face of the return , shall be paid to the county at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return , determined without
regard to any extension of time for filing the return .
   (F)   Every business entity making payments of $600 or more to persons or
business entities for services performed within the county is responsible for
maintaining the records of those payments and for completing IRS Form 1099 on
or before February 28 of the year  following the close of the calendar year in
which such compensation was paid and to remit copies of the IRS Form 1099 or
equivalent information to the county on or before February 28 of each year .
   (G)   The county  may grant any business entity an extension of not more
than six months , unless a longer extension has been granted by the Internal
Revenue Service or is agreed to by the county and the business entity , for
filing its return , if the business entity , on or before the date prescribed
for payment of the occupational license tax, requests the extension and pays
the amount properly estimated as its tax.
   (H)   If the time for filing a return is extended, the business entity shall
pay, as part of the tax, an amount equal to 12% per annum simple interest on
the tax shown due on the return , but not been previously paid, from the time
the tax was due until the return is actually filed and the tax paid to the
county . A fraction of a month is counted as an entire month .
   (I)   Except as provided in division (L) of this section, net profit shall
be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district , by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (J) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (K) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district , by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (K) of this section.
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (I) through (L) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the county .
   (J)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the county during the tax period by the business
entity for compensation , and the denominator of which is the total
compensation paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax
period. Compensation is paid or payable in the county based on the time the
individual’s service is performed within the county .
   (K)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the county during the tax period, and
the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
county if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
county regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the county and the purchaser is the
United States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the county based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the county and
the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-
producing activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (L)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the county , the
business entity  may petition the county or the county  may require, in respect
to all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity's  business activity in the county ; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit .
   (M)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee , both within and without the county , the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the county .
The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage that the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the county bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the county to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer reported percentages under this division, the
taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (N)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
“passed through” these entities to the owners.
   (O)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the county during any taxable year , or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year , the dissolution,
cessation of business , withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the county .
   (P)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return , the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government and shall employ the same methods of accounting required for
federal income tax purposes.
   (Q)   Where there has been an overpayment of tax under §
110.24 of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to any person or
business entity to the extent of overpayment only if a written application for
refund or credit is received by the county from the person or business entity
within two years from the date the overpayment was made. No refund shall be
made of any tax paid unless a complete return is filed as required by §
110.24 of this chapter.

§ 110.47 OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE REQUIRED; EMPLOYERS TO OBTAIN LICENSE, WITHHOLD
TAXES, AND FILE RETURNS.
   (A)   Every person and business entity engaged in any business and every
employer in the county shall be required to apply for and obtain an
occupational license from the county before the commencement of business or in
the event of a change of business status. Licensees are required to notify the
county of any changes in address, the cessation of business , or any other
changes that render the information supplied to the county in the license
application inaccurate.
   (B)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee shall
deduct and withhold upon the payment of the compensation an occupational
license tax calculated under §
110.46 of this chapter imposed against the compensation by the county . Amounts
withheld shall be paid to the county in accordance with this chapter.
   (C)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter ending
thereafter, on or before the end of the month  following the close of each
quarter, make a return and report to the county and pay to the county the tax
required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or
required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the county .
   (D)   The employer shall furnish a statement, on or before January 31 of
each year , showing the amount of compensation and occupational license tax
deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee for payment
to the county during the preceding calendar year .
   (E)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the county any sums
required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the county for any sum or sums withheld or required to
be withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (F)   The county shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the county sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the county , the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld
were required to be paid to the county . If the employer fails to withhold, the
lien shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by
the county .
   (G)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the county a reconciliation of the occupational
license tax withheld where compensation is paid or payable to employees .
Either copies of federal form W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax
statements, or a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent
information, as determined by the county , shall be submitted.
   (H)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (I)   The president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this section shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity , and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the county ,
nor the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that
liability, provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to
each and every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes
or became obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable
under this division unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully
account for, or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the
taxes imposed by this chapter become or became due.
   (J)   Notwithstanding divisions (G) and (H) of this section, every employee
receiving compensation in the county subject to the tax imposed under §
110.46 of this chapter shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all
cases where the employer does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter
from the employee , such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing
with the county each quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer or
as otherwise required by the License Inspector. If an employer fails to or is
not required to withhold, report , or pay the license fee it shall become the
duty of the employee to file with the county . The only employer that is not
required to withhold, report , and pay the occupational license tax is the
Federal Government including the United States Postal Service. The payment
required to be made by an employee can be made quarterly, for the periods
ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year , or at
any time the employee wishes to make an estimated payment for the year in which
wages are earned. All license fees must be received by February 28 for the
preceding calendar year , together with a copy of the employee's W-2 form.
Employers not required to withhold, report , or pay the license fee must
annually, during the month of January of each year , make a return to the
Occupational Tax Administrator, in which is set forth the name and social
security number of each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar
year , giving the amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation
earned during such preceding  year by each such employee . This list shall
include all current full time employees , part time employees , temporary
employees , and terminated employees whether it be voluntary or involuntary.
   (K)   Where there has been an overpayment of tax under §
110.47 of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to the employer only
to the extent that the amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld
under this section by the employer . Unless a written application for refund or
credit is received by the county from the employer within two years from the
date the overpayment was made, no refund or credit shall be allowed. Where
there has been an overpayment of the maximum tax due under this section, a
refund or credit shall be made to the employee to the extent of overpayment
only if a written application for refund is received by the county from the
employer or the employee within two years from the date the overpayment was
made. All written applications for refunds shall be submitted to the county
License Inspector on a form furnished or approved by the county . Refunds may
be withheld from an employee until the employer has filed all required forms
and provided all required information to the county License Inspector.
Overpayments of less than $5 shall not be refunded.
   (L)   An employee who has compensation attributable to activities performed
outside the county , based on time spent outside the county , whose employer
has withheld and remitted to this county the occupational license tax on the
compensation attributable to activities performed outside the county , may file
for a refund within two years of the date prescribed by law for the filing of a
return . The employee shall provide a schedule and computation sufficient to
verify the refund claim, and the county  may confirm with the employer the
percentage of time spent outside the county and the amount of compensation
attributable to activities performed outside the county prior to approval of
the refund.

§ 110.48 BUSINESS NET PROFIT RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (A)   All business entity  returns for the preceding taxable year shall be
made by April 15 of each year , except returns made on a fiscal year , which
shall be made by the 15th day of the fourth month  following the close of the
fiscal year . Blank forms shall be supplied by the county . In the event the
federal government extends the filing deadline for federal tax returns for the
preceding taxable year from April 15 of each year to a later date, all business
entity returns for the preceding taxable year shall be made by the same date
set by the federal government as the deadline for filing federal tax returns.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its
occupational license tax return with the county . Whenever, in the opinion of
the county , it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return of any
business entity in order to audit the return , the county  may compel the
business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and
schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed. The county
 may also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the federal
government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns , and comply with rules as the county from time to
time may prescribe. Whenever the county deems it necessary, the county  may
require a business entity , by notice served to the business entity , to make a
return , render statements under oath , or keep records, as the county deems
sufficient to determine the tax liability the business entity .
   (D)   The county  may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the
taxable income of any business entity , the attendance of a representative of
the business entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity , as
appears from the face of the return , shall be paid to the county at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return , determined without
regard to any extension of time for filing the return .
   (F)   Every business entity making payments of $600 or more to persons or
business entities for services performed within the county is responsible for
maintaining the records of those payments and for completing IRS Form 1099 on
or before February 28 of the year  following the close of the calendar year in
which such compensation was paid and to remit copies of the IRS Form 1099 or
equivalent information to the county on or before February 28 of each year .
   (G)   The county  may grant any business entity an extension of not more
than six months , unless a longer extension has been granted by the Internal
Revenue Service or is agreed to by the county and the business entity , for
filing its return , if the business entity , on or before the date prescribed
for payment of the occupational license tax, requests the extension and pays
the amount properly estimated as its tax.
   (H)   If the time for filing a return is extended, the business entity shall
pay, as part of the tax, an amount equal to 12% per annum simple interest on
the tax shown due on the return , but not been previously paid, from the time
the tax was due until the return is actually filed and the tax paid to the
county . A fraction of a month is counted as an entire month .
   (I)   Except as provided in division (L) of this section, net profit shall
be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district , by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (J) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (K) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district , by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (K) of this section.
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (I) through (L) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the county .
   (J)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the county during the tax period by the business
entity for compensation , and the denominator of which is the total
compensation paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax
period. Compensation is paid or payable in the county based on the time the
individual’s service is performed within the county .
   (K)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the county during the tax period, and
the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
county if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
county regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the county and the purchaser is the
United States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues , other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal
property or the lease or rental of real property, are apportioned to the county
based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the time spent in performing
such income-producing activity within the county and the denominator of which
is the total time spent performing that income-producing activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (L)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the county , the
business entity  may petition the county or the county  may require, in respect
to all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity's  business activity in the county ; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit .
   (M)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee , both within and without the county , the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the county .
The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage that the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the county bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the county to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer reported percentages under this division, the
taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (N)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
“passed through” these entities to the owners.
   (O)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the county during any taxable year , or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year , the dissolution,
cessation of business , withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the county .
   (P)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return , the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government and shall employ the same methods of accounting required for
federal income tax purposes.
   (Q)   Where there has been an overpayment of tax under §
110.48 of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to any person or
business entity to the extent of overpayment only if a written application for
refund or credit is received by the county from the person or business entity
within two years from the date the overpayment was made. No refund shall be
made of any tax paid unless a complete return is filed as required by §
110.48 of this chapter.

enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the company are just and
reasonable.
      (3)   Where the county , city or a public utility serving the county
desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the

unduly interfere with the company's operations.
   (E)   Relocation of the facilities. In the event that at any time during the

system, or the Board gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew the

franchise with the address and telephone number of the office concerning the
county office responsible for administration of the franchise with the address
and telephone number of the office.
   (D)   When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists

expense, by a professional engineer not on the permanent staff of the company .
The engineer should sign all records of special tests and forward to the Board
such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and
recommending actions to be taken.
   (F)   The county's right under this section shall be limited to requiring
tests, analyses, and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics
based on said complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as
the Board has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other
evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against
substandard cable service.

§ 113.39 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   For the reason that the streets of the county , Commonwealth, and
cities to be used by the company in the operation of its system within the
boundaries of the county are valuable public properties acquired and maintained
by the county , Commonwealth, and cities at great expense to its taxpayers, and
that the grant to the company to the said streets is a valuable property right
without which the company would be required to invest substantial capital in
right-of-way costs and acquisitions, the company shall pay to the Board an
amount equal to 3% of the company's gross annual revenue from all sources
attributable to the operations of the company within the confines of the
franchise area. In the event that the law permits some larger basis for
computing this fee, the Board shall, at its election, be entitled to collect
such additional monies upon 60 days' prior written notice to the company .
However, upon receipt of such notice, the company shall be entitled to initiate
a petition for an equivalent rate increase pursuant to §
113.58, notwithstanding any other then pending or recently decided rate
requests. In said event, the Board shall afford said rate increase petition a
presumption of reasonableness and shall stay the effective date of said new fee
until 60 days after its decision on said rate petition.
   (B)   It is the intent of the Board to utilize franchise fees as necessary
to defray the costs of local regulation of the company , to support the
development of the access channels and generally to encourage development of
the system.
   (C)   This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to
the county , city, or other taxing jurisdiction by the company .
   (D)   The franchise fee and any other cost or penalties assessed shall be
payable quarterly, and the company shall file a complete and accurate verified
statement of all gross receipts within the franchise area during the period for
which said payment is made. Said payment shall be made to the Board not later
than 30 days after the expiration of each quarter year .
   (E)   In order to facilitate the initial operation of the Campbell County
CATV Board , the company shall pay to the Board within 30 days of the franchise
award, a sum of $30,000. This sum shall be considered a pre- paid franchise fee
and will be deducted from the annual franchise fee payment in equal amounts
over the first ten years of system operation.
   (F)   The Board shall have the right to inspect the company's income records
and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable
under this chapter; provided, however, that such audit shall take place within
36 months  following the close of each of the company's fiscal years . Any
additional amount due to the Board as a result of the audit shall be paid
within 30 days following  written notice to the company by the Board which
notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
   (G)   In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount, cost or
penalty, is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified,
interest shall be charged daily from such date at the annual rate of 8% plus 5%
penalty.

§ 113.40 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (A)   The franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or
in part, or leased, sublet, or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title
thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein,
pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the CATV
Board . The company  may , however, transfer or assign the franchise to a
wholly owned subsidiary of the company and such subsidiary may transfer or
assign the franchise back to the company without such consent. The proposed
assignee must show financial responsibility as determined by the Board and must
agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. The Board shall be deemed
to have consented to a proposed transfer or assignment in the event its refusal
to consent is not communicated in writing to the company within 60 days
following receipt of written notice of the proposed transfer or assignment.
   (B)   The company shall promptly notify the Board of any actual or proposed
change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of the
company . The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major
stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised.
A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise
upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of 10%
of the voting shares of the company . Every change, transfer, or acquisition of
control of the company shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless
and until the Board shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent
to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the Board  may inquire
into the qualification of the prospective controlling party, and the company
shall assist the Board in any such inquiry.
   (C)   The consent or approval of the Board to any transfer of the company
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the county in and to
the streets , and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to
the terms and conditions of the franchise.
   (D)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Board will not
approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to substantial
completion of construction of the proposed system.
   (E)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved
without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise
agreement.

under particular circumstances and to benefit of the general public by allowing
temporary off-site sales or display events (i.e. "Tent Sales") of motor
vehicles by dealers on hard surfaced areas with adequate parking for both the
principle use as well as the temporary off-site sales or display event. Such
displays are subject to certain requirements and, if these requirements cannot
be satisfied, the display is prohibited.
(Ord. O-12-04, passed 5-21-04)

be stationary in nature such as when conducted in tents and buildings and shall
not be mobile in nature as if conducted from a truck or other vehicle. Safety
in terms of vehicular circulation, fire separation and accessibility for
emergency vehicles, shall be a prime consideration when evaluating the location
of the displays. All types of displays must be positioned so that the existing
vehicular and pedestrian traffic flow is not impeded. All applicable building,
fire and health codes must also be met.

property where the display is proposed to be located.
      (2)   Indicate any existing development, structures and types of uses on
the site as well as on adjoining sites of the proposed temporary off-site sales
or display event.
      (3)   Show the dimensions and location of the area to be used for the

services to be on display.
      (6)   State the dates the display is to be located on the site.

developments and the temporary off-site sales or display event.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and determine
whether or not the plan conforms with these regulations and all other
applicable provisions of the zoning regulations.
(Ord. O-12-04, passed 5-21-04)
§ 116.06 REVIEW OF ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Zoning Administrator is permitted to issue a permit for the temporary
off-site sales or display event upon receiving a completed application
containing all the information required in these regulations and all other
provisions of the zoning regulations, as well as the full applicable fee. After
reviewing the completed application, the Zoning Administrator may issue a
permit if all applicable requirements have been fulfilled. Any deviation in the
location of a display from the requirements of the zoning regulations must be
approved in advance by the Zoning Administrator.
(Ord. O-12-04, passed 5-21-04)
§ 116.07 FEE.
   At the time of application for a temporary off-site sales or display event
permit, the applicant shall pay in full to the county a fee as indicated in the
then current CC&MP&ZC fee schedule. The fee shall initially be set at $250.00

occupational licenses, etc.
(Ord. O-12-04, passed 5-21-04)
§ 116.09 LIMIT OF PERMITS ON EACH SITE.

commercial displays, exhibits or events of limited duration rather than to
establish a regular or long-term use of land. Thus, no permit shall be issued
for a site under these regulations that has had three prior temporary off-site
sales or display event permits issued during the same calendar year for the
same site.
(Ord. O-12-04, passed 5-21-04)

regulations apply to sidewalk sales by a commercial establishment that
regularly does business on the same premises, where the articles or goods on
outdoor display are the same as are usually displayed for sale at its
establishment.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the Commonwealth has in KRS Ch. 100 delegated to local
government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
Fiscal Court of the county hereby adopts the following floodplain management
ordinance, as follows in this chapter.
(Ord. O-17-13, passed 12-18-13)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood -proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. O-17-13, passed 12-18-13)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due
to flooding  by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods , including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains , stream channels,
and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (B)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood -blighted areas caused by flooding ;
      (7)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area ; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.

give this chapter its most reasonable application. For the purpose of this
chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area  (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding  is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A Zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but

flood , base flood  elevations, and flood  hazard factors are not determined.
   A99 ZONE. That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood  which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood  by a federal flood  protection system
under construction. No base flood  elevations are determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE or APPURTENANT STRUCTURE. A structure  located on the
same parcel of property as the principle structure , the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principle structure . ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood  damage potential. Examples of
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (to an existing structure ). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure  in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction .
   AE ZONES.  Special flood hazard areas  inundated by the 1% annual chance
flood  (100-year flood ). Base flood  elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding  where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood  elevations are
determined.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding  where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood  depths are
determined.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s  ruling on a request for a variance .
   AR/A1—A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AND AR/A ZONES.  Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs)  that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood  protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding  from other flooding  sources.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO  or AH Zone  on a community's
 Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)  where the base flood  depths range from one
to three feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding  is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding  is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood  which has a 1% percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (also called the 100-year flood ). BASE FLOOD is the
term used throughout this chapter.

subdivision  regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development  in flood-prone areas . This term
describes federal, state, and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood  damage prevention and
reduction.

151.60 through
151.66, “Appeals  and Variance   Procedures,” the variance granted must not
cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement,
the Campbell County Fiscal Court will consider the fact that every newly
constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of
the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods , while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In
addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject
to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance
rates.

   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures  (for example, safety, structural integrity, flood
routing capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure .

synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD)  1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD)  1988.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation

continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood -proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level . In AE , Al—30, and A Zones
where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation , said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
         (b)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure ,
said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further

      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure (including manufactured home ) shall have the lowest floor ,
including basement , mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than
one foot above the base flood elevation . Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure , openings sufficient to facilitate
automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall be provided
in accordance with standards of division (C) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   In an AO zone the lowest floor shall be, elevated above the
highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number
specified in feet on the FIRM , or elevated at least two feet above the highest
adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
         (b)   In an A zone , where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than one foot
above such base flood elevation . Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative
Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the
technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: “The applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries [and thereby Base
Flood Elevations] at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than + 0.5 foot. Cross sections
elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in
slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain
change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and
shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If
necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet
may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend
beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary
calculations.”

elevated to conform with division (A) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water.
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this section are satisfied. Such certification along with the
design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator .
      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) of this
section.
      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements ) that are usable

subject to flooding shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation one foot above the base flood elevation and shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes for meeting this
requirement must meet or exceed the standards of §
151.46(C).
   (C)   Elevated structures .
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvements of elevated structures
on columns, posts, or pilings (for example) that include fully enclosed areas
formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (2)   (a)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either
be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following
minimum criteria:
            1.   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding ;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
         (b)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
         (c)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles .
      (1)   (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed

as a result of a flood , all manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated
so that the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, so that
either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation ; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less

   (E)   Floodways . Located within areas of special flood  hazard established
in §
151.06 are areas designated as floodways . Since the floodway  is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood  waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments , including fill, new construction ,
substantial improvements , and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If division (E) of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
151.45 through
151.51.
(Ord. O-17-13, passed 12-18-13)
§ 151.47 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR

§ 151.48 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.06, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate, therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall:
      (2)   Have the lowest flood , including basement , elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the

151.99
APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 151.60 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure , its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the Campbell County Fiscal Court to help protect its
citizens from flooding . This need is so compelling and the implications of the
cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that
variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter
are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and
damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the
variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain
multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted.
The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. O-17-13, passed 12-18-13)
§ 151.61 DESIGNATION OF VARIANCE AND APPEAL BOARD.
   The Campbell County Fiscal Court shall establish an Variance and Appeal
Board consisting of the Campbell County and Municipal Board of Adjustment.

§ 151.62 DUTIES OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
   (A)   The Variance and Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   (B)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Variance and Appeal Board
or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the county circuit court, as
provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.
(Ord. O-17-13, passed 12-18-13)
§ 151.63 APPEALS/VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   In passing upon such applications, the Variance and Appeal Board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
   (A)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
   (B)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   (C)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
   (D)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed
facility;
   (E)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of
functionally dependent facility;
   (F)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
   (G)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development ;
   (H)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
   (I)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   (J)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
   (K)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.

   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
chapter, the Variance and Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
   (A)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood hazard.
MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances  to an
elevation requirement, this means the Campbell County and Municipal Board of
Adjustment need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or
even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation
which the Campbell County and Municipal Board of Adjustment believes will both
provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
151.04 under public safety and nuisance ), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in §
151.04) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (D)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (E)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) upon request.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction , substantial improvement
, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of divisions (A)
through (E) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not
create a public nuisance.
(Ord. O-17-13, passed 12-18-13)
§ 151.65 VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.
   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that:
   (A)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage.
   (B)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the County Clerk and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(Ord. O-17-13, passed 12-18-13)
§ 151.66 HISTORIC STRUCTURES.
   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (see §
151.04) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure .
(Ord. O-17-13, passed 12-18-13)
§ 151.99 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION NOTICE, AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development  occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain  construction permit
and any approved modifications, such development  shall constitute a civil
offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation . If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator  has reasonable cause to believe that a
person  has caused development  to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation , the section of this chapter
and/or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development . The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation; notice of violation . If, at any time, a duly
authorized employee or agent of the Floodplain Administrator  has reasonable
cause to believe that a person  has caused development  to occur which is not
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain  development permit and
any approved modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the
Floodplain Administrator may issue a citation to the offender stating the
violation , prior notices of violation issued, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, and
what penalty or penalties are recommended. When a citation is issued, the
person to whom the citation is issued shall respond to the citation within
seven days of the date the citation is issued by either carrying out the
remedies and corrections set forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set
forth in the citation, or requesting a hearing before the governing body . If
the person to whom the citation is issued does not respond to the citation
within seven days, that person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a
hearing and the determination that a violation occurred shall be considered
final.
   (D)   Penalties.  Violation  of the provisions of this chapter or failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violation  of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance  or special
exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person  who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined no less than $250 or imprisoned for not more
than 90 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses
involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain
Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent
or remedy any violation .

portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be made on the
official zoning map by the Zoning Administrator promptly after the amendment to
this chapter has been approved of by the County Commissioners and the Planning
and Zoning Commission is officially notified by a certified copy of said
amendment in ordinance form. Such change shall not become effective until said
changes have been made on said map. In addition, no building , structure , sign
, or fence permit shall be approved or issued until the official zoning map
indicates the proper zoning for the use intended as indicated upon the
application for a permit.
      (2)   No changes of any nature shall be made on the official zoning map
or matter shown thereon which are not in conformity with the procedures set

current zoning status of land, buildings , and other structures in the county.
   (B)   Replacement of official zoning map. In the event that the official
zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or is deemed necessary to be
replaced due to the age of the map or major corrections in location of rights-

official zoning map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map but no
such corrections shall have the effect of amending the original zoning map or
any subsequent amendment thereto.
   (C)   Pursuant to the authority and requirements of division (B) of this
section, the Official Zoning Map attached to Ord. O-20-2000 is hereby adopted
and shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. However, the adoption of the
updated information on the new Official Zoning Map shall not have the affect of

occurred through the years. This new Official Zoning Map that is being adopted
is merely an updated compilation of previously adopted material and updated
information as to streets, rights-of-way, subdivisions , and the like.

§ 154.046 HOME-BASED BUSINESS.
   Home occupations or a home-based business is a business, profession or other
economic activity conducted full- or part-time at the principal residence of
the person conducting the business. Home-based businesses are frequently used
as incubators during the start-up phase of the operation. Existing or new
businesses which exceed the regulations of this section may be deemed as ready
to transition to a professional environment and are subject to action by the
Planning Commission or their duly authorized representative regarding non-
conformance with this section. The use of property for agricultural purposes is
not considered a home-based business and shall not be governed by the home-
based business regulations of this section.
   (A)   General requirements. The following requirements shall apply to a
home-based business:
      (1)   No more than one employee other than those residing on the premises
shall be engaged in a home-based business on the premises at any one point in
time.

or premises, or other visible evidence of the conduct of a home-based business
that will indicate from the exterior that the building is being utilized in
part for any purpose other than its primary permitted use .
      (5)   Signage is subject to §§
154.186 through
154.192.
      (6)   No unreasonable traffic or parking shall be generated by a home-
based business in greater volumes, location or type than would normally be
expected in a residential neighborhood.
      (7)   The use shall involve the storage or use of hazardous, toxic,
flammable or explosive substances, other than types and amounts commonly found
in a dwelling .
      (8)   No equipment or process, which creates noise, vibration, flare,
fumes, odors, or electrical interference detectable to the normal senses beyond
the boundary of the property shall be used in such home-based business. Noise
shall be limited to those typical to a residential neighborhood.
      (9)   Based upon the potential nuisances of a proposed home-based
business, it may be determined that a particular type, intensity, or use is
unsuitable.
   (B)   Light home-based business. Light home-based businesses shall be
limited to the following types of activities and shall not require a zoning
permit provided that they meet the general requirements (listed above):
      (1)   Office-type work;
      (2)   Custom sewing and fabric crafts;
      (3)   Creation of visual or musical arts;
      (4)   Sales and surveys over the phone or computer;

include a space for the dwelling ). The front yard should not be used as a
parking space in order to retain the residential character of the property.
      (2)   Hours of operation, including delivery and receiving, shall be
conducted in a way that is not perceptible from beyond the lot line between the
hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
      (3)   General home-based businesses are limited to the following types of
activities and shall require a zoning permit:

any customary accessory buildings until and unless the location of said use
shall have been applied for and approved as part of a conditional use permit by
the Board of Adjustment as set forth in §
154.049. Other home-based businesses are those not specifically identified by
light or general home-based businesses.
   (E)   Waiver. A home-based business may apply for a waiver of one or more of
the general requirements through the Board of Adjustments . KRS 100.247 states
that a variance cannot contradict zoning regulation. The Board shall not
possess the power to grant a variance to permit a use of any land, building ,
or structure which is not permitted by the zoning regulation in the zone in
question, or to alter density requirements in the zone in question.

      (1)   Any lot of record which does not meet the requirements of this
chapter shall be considered a nonconforming  lot of record .
      (2)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots
with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at time of passage
or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements for lot width and area as established by this chapter, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this
chapter and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet
lot width and area requirement established by this chapter, nor shall any
division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or
area below the requirements stated in this chapter. Except, however, where a
subdivision (including preliminary or final plat) has been approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission under prior zoning regulations, and meets
existing minimum lot area requirements, but not minimum lot width or other
similar requirements, development is permitted on each individual lot as
originally approved.
      (3)   Where a single nonconforming  lot of record exists having a lot
area less than required by the particular zone wherein said lot is located,
development may be permitted on the lot , provided:
      the lot is located on an existing and improved public street ; the lot is
of separate ownership for all adjacent and contiguous parcels; the adjacent and
contiguous parcels exist as developed building  lots or dedicated street right-
of-ways precluding acquisition of additional area to achieve conformity; and
development proposed on the lot is in conformance with all other requirements
of this chapter. Where a dimensional variance from any minimum yard , setback,
and the like is necessary to develop on said lot , an application for
dimensional variance shall be submitted for review and approval by the Board of
Adjustments in accordance with §§
154.245 through
154.264.
   (B)   Nonconforming uses .
      (1) Continuance. Except as herein provided, the lawful use of any
structure or land existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter may be
continued although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter,
it shall become a legal nonconforming use . However, no nonconforming use or
structure may be enlarged or extended beyond its area of use at the time is
becomes a legal nonconforming use , unless and until the use is brought into
conformance with all provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Change from one nonconforming use to another. As regulated by §
154.261(D).
      (3)   Termination. In all cases, the Board of Adjustments shall hold a

154.258. Following that hearing, the Board may terminate the right to operate a
nonconforming use based on any of the following conditions, and if the decision
is to do so, the Board shall state its bases, in writing, for such
determination.
         (a)   Changing to a conforming use .
         (b)   Non-operative, nonused, or abandoned for a period of six
consecutive months providing that the Board of Adjustments may allow the
continuation of such nonconforming use if it is determined that reasons for
such nonuse were beyond the owner's/operator's control.
         (c)   Whenever the structure , in which the nonconforming use is
operated, is damaged in any manner whatsoever and the cost of repairing such
damage exceeds 50% of the market value of such structure in which the
nonconforming use is operated and a determination is made by the Board of
Adjustments that this structure should not be reconstructed.
         (d)   Whenever the structure , in which the nonconforming use is
operated, becomes obsolete or substandard under any applicable ordinance of the
county and the cost of placing such structure in lawful compliance with the
applicable ordinance exceeds 50% of the market value of such structure as of
the date of the official order under the applicable ordinance and a
determination is made by the Board of Adjustments that this structure should
not be reconstructed.
         (e)   Whenever said nonconforming use is determined to be detrimental
or injurious to the public health, safety, or general welfare.
         (f)   Zone change. The foregoing provisions shall apply to uses which
become legally nonconforming due to zone changes which take place thereafter,
or were found to be nonconforming thereafter.
   (C)   Nonconforming structures .
      (1)   Continuance. Except as herein provided, any lawful nonconforming
structure existing at the time of adoption of this chapter may be occupied,
operated, and maintained in a state of good repair, but no nonconforming
structure shall be enlarged or extended.
      (2)   Termination. Except as otherwise provided, any nonconforming
structure may be repaired or reconstructed to its original condition, including
structures damaged or substandard under any applicable ordinance for which the
cost of reconstructing or repairing said structure exceeds 50% of the market
value of such structure . However, if a nonconforming structure is to be
reconstructed on a new foundation, said structure must meet existing zoning
requirements (inclusive of the right to request a dimensional variance ) and,
in such cases, the right to continue the nonconforming structure would be
terminated.
      (3)   Zone change. The foregoing provisions shall apply to structures
which become legally nonconforming due to zone changes which take place
thereafter, or were found to be nonconforming thereafter.
   (D)   Repairs and maintenance.
      (1)   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming
use , work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic
content of the building , as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of
this chapter which rendered it nonconforming, shall not be increased.
      (2)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring, to a safe condition, of any building , structure ,
or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting
the public safety, except for the conditions as stated in divisions (B)(3)(c)
or (C)(2).
   (E)   Nonconforming signs .
      (1)   Continuance. Except as herein provided, any lawful nonconforming
sign existing at the time of adoption of this chapter, may be continued
provided however, that no such sign shall be changed in any manner unless it is
changed in compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Termination. In all cases the Board of Adjustments shall hold a
public hearing in accordance with the applicable requirements of §
154.258. Following that hearing, the Board may terminate the right to operate a
nonconforming sign based on any of the following conditions and, if the
decision is to do so, the Board shall state its bases, in writing, for such
determination.
         (a)   Not meeting the requirements for sign regulations, as regulated
in §§

existing front yards .
      (2)   In any residential zone , no front yard shall be required to exceed
the average depth of existing front yards on the same side of the street within
the same block, when 51% or more of lots within that block are improved with
residential buildings whichever is greater.

§ 154.049 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Determination. Subject to the requirements of §
154.262, the Board of Adjustments may authorize a conditional use to be located
within any zone in which such conditional use is permitted, if the evidence
presented by the applicant is such as to establish a preponderance of the
evidence:
      (1)   That the proposed use at the particular location is necessary or
desirable to provide a service or facility which will contribute to the general
well-being of the neighborhood or the community;
      (2)   That such use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, or
general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to
property or improvements in the vicinity.
      (3)   That such use will comply with any regulations and conditions in
this chapter for such use.
   (B)   Conditional use permits . In accordance with KRS 100.237, the Board of
Adjustments shall have the power to hear and decide applications for
conditional use permits to allow the proper integration into the community of
uses which are specifically named herein which may be suitable only in specific
locations in the zone only if certain conditions are met:
      (1)   The Board of Adjustments may approve, modify, or deny any
application for a conditional use permit . If it approves such permit, it may
attach necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or
more things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a
continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board's minutes
and on the conditional use permit , along with a reference to the specific
section in the zoning regulation listing the conditional use under
consideration. In addition, said conditional use permit shall be recorded in
the office of the County Clerk and one copy of said permit attached to the deed
for the property for which it is issued. The Board shall have power to revoke
conditional use permits , or variance for noncompliance with the condition
thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have a right of action to compel
offending structures or uses removed at the cost of the violator and may have
judgment in personam for such cost.
      (2)   Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant
from complying with all of the requirements of this chapter, the building code,
housing code, and other regulations of the county.
      (3)   In any case where a conditional use  conditional use permit has not
been exercised within the time limit set by the Board or within 12 consecutive
calendar months from the date of issuance, such conditional use permit shall
not revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing.
Exercised as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for
the construction of the main building or other improvement has been let; or in
the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is under
construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving
substantial investment shall be under contract, in development, or completed.
When construction is not a part of the use, exercised shall mean that the use
in operation is in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.
      (4)   (a)   The Zoning Administrator shall review all conditional use
permits , except those for which all conditions have been permanently
satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land
or structure where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that
the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the
conditional use permits .
         (b)   If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions
listed on the conditional use permit , the Zoning Administrator shall report
the fact in writing to the Chairperson of the Board of Adjustments . The report
shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying
with the conditions on the conditional use permit , and a copy of the report
shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time it is furnished to the
Chairperson of the Board of Adjustments .
         (c)   The Board shall hold a hearing on the report within 30 days and
notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner
at least one week prior to the hearing. If the Board of Adjustments finds that
the facts alleged in the report of the Zoning Administrator are true and that
the landowner has taken no steps to comply within the time between the date of
the report and the date of the hearing, the Board of Adjustments may authorize
the Zoning Administrator to revoke the conditional use permit and take the
necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity on the land
which the conditional use permit authorizes.
      (5)   Once the Board of Adjustments has completed a conditional use
permit and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be
completely and permanently satisfied, the Zoning Administrator , upon request
of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the
conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts which indicate that the
conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of
the conditional use permit which is on file with the County Clerk, as required
in KRS 100.344. Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the other
requirements of this chapter, will be treated as a permitted use in a
nonconforming status.

horizontally from any existing or proposed water line.
      (4)   The effluent from this sewage must be piped and discharged directly
into a blue line stream. Discharge into a "blue line" stream is not acceptable
if access is not available by gravity feed, or if there is insufficient flow in
the stream to adequately handle the discharge, or if for any reason in the
opinion of an expert employed by the county for the purpose of making such
determination, the discharge would be unreasonably detrimental to the community
or the environment.
      (5)   In the event no acceptable "blue line" stream exists on the
property, the applicant must comply with the following procedures:
         (a)   A site plan must be prepared by a registered professional
engineer showing the applicants property lines, location of treatment system,
discharge point of effluent into the "blue line" stream, property lines of
other tracts of land over which the proposed line is to be placed.
         (b)   The applicant must obtain a written perpetual easement from all
property owners of land under which the pipe is to be placed, and being a
minimum often (10) feet in width. As a minimum the perpetual easement must
provide for placement of the pipe and for ingress and egress for construction
and maintenance of the pipe, and for inspection of same.
         (c)   Should a "blue line" stream not be acceptable in the opinion of
an expert employed by the County for the purpose of making such determination,
the applicant may request that the effluent be discharged into a natural stream
or drainage ditch that flows into a "blue line" stream. Such request must also
be included in the applicants request to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The
applicant must obtain a written perpetual easement from all property owners of
land on or under which the natural stream or drainage ditch flows, including
easements across all city, county, or state right of ways.
         (d)   If the discharge of effluent, human waste, grey water, or the
line, flows into or upon any property of right of way owned by Campbell County,
Campbell County Public Parks Inc. a written perpetual easement shall be
required. To request such easement , the applicant shall submit the site plan,
as required, to request such easement , the applicant shall submit the site
plan, as required above, a legal description of the real estate with a
description of the requested easement and any other requested documentation to
the county engineer for approval. The county engineer shall review the request
and other documents and then make a recommendation to the fiscal court. Nothing
in this section shall require the county or any other entity to grant an
easement to any person , corporation, or other entity. The county or any other
property owner may, in its discretion require payment of fair market valve for
the grant of easement under this section.
         (e)   All easements granted by the county under this section shall
state that the easement is temporary and may be terminated by the county twelve
(12) months after a sanitary sewer is in place. All improvements, structures ,
or other objects located within said easement by applicant, may be altered or
removed at the request of the Fiscal Court at the expense of the applicant.
         (f)   In the event pollution of the receiving stream, ditch or "blue
line" stream results from the discharge of the treated effluent, additional
treatment and/or extension of the effluent line shall be required. The
enforcement of this requirement shall be made by the Commonwealth of Kentucky,
the local health department, or the Campbell County Fiscal Court.

§ 154.058 HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS.
   (A)   This section is designed to ensure, when development is proposed in
those areas of the community which have physical characteristics limiting
development (hillside slopes of 20% or greater) that said development will
occur in a manner harmonious with adjacent lands so as to minimize problems of
drainage, erosion, earth movement, and other natural hazards.
   (B)   Areas of land on which development is physically restricted due to
excessive hillside slopes shall be limited according to the following
requirements, notwithstanding any other section of this chapter or any other
ordinance adopted by the county:
      (1)   All land areas located within the county and identified on the
Comprehensive Plan as "Physically Restrictive Development Areas" and any other
areas which have slopes of 20% or greater shall require approval before
development may occur. In those areas which are identified in the Comprehensive
Plan as physically restrictive development areas and containing slopes less
than 20%, the requirements contained herein may be waived; if, after review of
the proposed site plan by the engineer, it is determined that said development
will not result in hillside slippage or soil erosion.
      (2)   No excavation, removal, or placement of any soil, foundation
placement, or construction of buildings or structures of any nature within the
area identified in division (B)(1) above, may occur until plan specifications
for such work have been submitted in the form of a site plan as regulated by §
154.054. In addition to site plan requirements, the following shall also be
submitted.
         (a)   Plans which show existing topography and the proposed physical
changes necessary for construction, indicating grading (cutting and filling)
compaction, erosion ponds, areas to be defoliated, and any other pertinent
information which will change the natural physical features of the site or
general area.
         (b)   Subsurface investigation of the area under consideration,
including test boring, laboratory tests, engineering tests, and a geological
analysis should be made by a qualified registered civil engineer and a
geologist, indicating that the building and physical changes proposed in the
area will be completed in a manner which will minimize hillside slippage or
soil erosion.
      (3)   The site plan and other information required in division (B)(2) of
this section shall be reviewed by the County Engineer who will recommend to the
Planning and Zoning Commission what effect the proposed development will have
on hillside slippage and soil erosion. After consideration of the
recommendation, the Planning and Zoning Commission may grant a permit for use
of the site in accordance with the submitted plans.
      (4)   If, after review of the plans required by this section, the
Planning and Zoning Commission determines that said proposed plans will not
minimize hillside slippage, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall deny a
permit for the development of said land, and the site shall be limited to those
open type uses, excluding structures , as permitted or conditionally permitted
in the Conservation Zone.

§ 154.059 FLOOD PROTECTION DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the flood protection development controls is:
      (1)   To encourage only that development of flood prone areas which is
appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and the need to reduce
flood losses, is an acceptable social and economic use of the land in relation
to the hazards involved, and does not increase the damage to human life; and
      (2)   To discourage all other development in flood prone areas not
identified in division (A)(1) above.
   (B)   Areas of land adjacent to streams, rivers, or bodies of water which
have a high degree of susceptibility to flooding shall be limited to
development according to the following regulations, notwithstanding any other
section of this chapter or any other ordinance adopted by the county.
      (1)   The limits of the flood plain are shown on the official zoning map
of the county in screen pattern, designated as a flood protection control area
(which pattern may overlap and include one or more zoning districts ). The
limits of the floodway are contained within the flood protection control area
and also identified on the official zoning map.
      (2)   Areas designated as susceptible to flooding shall be controlled by
both the zoning district in which the area is located and the requirements of
this section.
      (3)   No person , city, county or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence filling any area with earth, debris, or any other material
or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building , barrier, or
obstruction of any sort on any area located within the floodway which would
result in any increase in flood heights during the recurrence of a 100-year
flood discharge. Plans and specifications for such work shall be submitted to
the County Municipal Planning and Zoning Commission for review and approval to
determine if said encroachment will meet the requirements of this chapter, also
the approval by the Division of Water, Kentucky Department for Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection and the Corps of Engineers are required.
      (4)   (a)   All land outside the floodway of the Ohio and Licking Rivers
and their tributaries, but located within the flood plain may be used for any
purpose for which it is zoned; provided that any new residential construction
including any expansion or substantial improvements of existing residential
structures as herein defined within said flood plain shall have the lowest
floor which is used for living quarters elevated to or above the level of the
100-year flood .
         (b)   In the case of construction of new nonresidential structures
including any expansion or substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures within the flood plain area, the lowest floor shall be elevated to
or above the level of the 100-year flood or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, floodproofed up to the level of the 100-year flood .
         (c)   See Appendix S for elevation of the 100-year flood along the
Ohio and Licking Rivers. In the case of any proposed activity along the
tributaries of the Ohio and Licking Rivers, a survey shall be made by a
qualified registered civil engineer establishing the elevation of the 100-year
flood for said area along the tributary prior to the issuance of a building
permit .
         (d)   All roadway accesses and utilities to structures located within
the flood plain shall be flood protection of the land filled, or any
combination thereof, to the level of not less than the elevation of a flood
with a recurrence interval of 100 years. In constructing an earth fill either
partially or entirely within the flood plain , said design shall provide
assurance from the Corps of Engineers that the fill does not restrict or
obstruct the flow of flood waters or reduce the hydraulic efficiency of the
channel, which in turn could cause flood water backup and resultant high flood
water elevation upstream of the filled site. Where the fill is partially within
the flood plain , roadway access and utilities shall be provided from the dry
side. If the fill is entirely in the flood plain , roadway access and utilities
shall be provided by constructing an access road or bridge to an elevation
above the 100-year flood .
         (e)   For purposes of this section, SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT means any
repair, reconstruction, or improvement as a result of damage to the structure ,
the cost of which equals of exceeds 50% of the actual market value of the
structure  before the damage occurred. Substantial improvement is started when
the first alteration of any structural part of the building  commences.
      (5)   All construction or modification of buildings and structures
including flood proofing measures and techniques in the flood plain area shall
be in accordance with the applicable design standards of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers publication entitled "Flood Proofing Regulations", June, 1972 GPO
19730-505-026 Edition, or as amended.
      (6)   An existing structure or use which is regulated by this section and
which does not conform to the requirements herein shall be nonconforming by
reason of noncompliance and subject to the requirements of §
154.047; however, any existing permitted use and structure may be modified,
altered, or repaired to incorporate flood proofing measures, where such
measures do not raise the level of the 100-year flood , subject to the
conditions of division (B)(4) above.
      (7)   All land above the elevation of a flood with a recurrence interval
of 100 years may be used for any purpose for which it is zoned without further
flood protection.
      (8)   A survey of the site in question will be required prior to the
issuance of any building permit or construction activity that would alter the
site in any manner, to firmly establish the existing elevation of the land.
      (9)   A site plan, as regulated by §
154.054, shall be required for any land below the elevation of a flood with a
recurrence interval of 100 years.

§ 154.061 PHASED ZONING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Phased zoning is an overlay type regulation to be used in cases where
the timing and/or phasing of the zoning of an area is especially critical to
the implementation of the adopted Comprehensive Plan . The intent of the phased
zoning regulations is to encourage development or redevelopment of a specified
area of the use and/or density designated on the Comprehensive Plan when the
necessary conditions for such development are realized (for example, demolition
of existing deteriorated areas; provision of urban services, such as public
water and centralized sanitary sewer systems). Implicit in such a phased zoning
approach is the premise that until such conditions are realized, the type of
development identified by the Comprehensive Plan is premature; such development
would be prevented by temporarily zoning the area to generally conform with the
predominant existing land use, with a clear stipulation of an intended future
re-zoning, which would be in compliance with the adopted Comprehensive Plan .
   (B)   The phased zoning regulations may be overlaid over any zoning
classification by means of a conventional zone change process. The use of the
phased zoning regulations would indicate that the regulations of the overlaid
zone are currently being enforced based upon the general existing land use, but
on attainment of all the requirements of the zone which corresponds to the
adopted Comprehensive Plan for type of use and/or density and other
requirements of this chapter, the area could be rezoned in direct compliance
with the Plan.
   (C)   Phased zones are indicated on the official zoning map by adding to the
overlaid zone , the letter "P" as a suffix enclosed in parentheses. For
example, in order to properly phase its change to an urban development, an area
zoned "R-RE" in a rural area which is identified for future single family
residential urban development at 3.5 dwelling units per net acre on the locally
adopted Comprehensive Plan could be temporarily zoned "R-RE (P)", indicating
the present development on the site would be in conformance with the
regulations of the overlaid R-RE Zone, but that, upon the attainment of certain
conditions (for example, provision of adequate public water and centralized
sanitary sewer facilities) required for single family urban development at 3.5
dwelling units per net acre as indicated on the Comprehensive Plan , the area
could be rezoned through a conventional zone change procedure. At the time of
the zone change, the temporary R-RE (P) Zone is removed and the area is
developed according to the regulations of the new zone , which is in
conformance with the adopted Comprehensive Plan .
   (D)   The minimum size of any area to be rezoned as regulated by this
section is ten acres, provided that all other provisions of this chapter and
the county subdivision regulations are adhered to. Development of a smaller
tract adjacent to an existing zone being requested may be permitted if the
proposed development conforms to and extends the original development as if the
new area had been a part of the original development, and provided further that
the zone is in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan .

§ 154.089 RCD RESIDENTIAL CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the Residential Cluster Development (RCD)
Overlay Zone is to provide a means whereby clusters of attached and detached
single-family residential units may be constructed in the R-1 Single-Family
Residential Zones, and therein, through a development plan, permit a wide
flexibility in the design, location, siting of buildings, in order to provide
for, to the greatest extent possible, the preservation of hillside areas, and
other natural geographic and topographic features, and to provide for more
usable and suitably located recreation facilities and open space than would
otherwise be provided under conventional R-1 Single-Family Residential land
development procedures.
   (B)   General. A Residential Cluster Development Overlay Zone may be
permitted only to be superimposed over any of the R-1 Single-Family Residential
Zones provided that all conditions on provisions of this section, the
applicable requirements of the subdivision regulations, and any additional
requirements as may be determined necessary to provide for the most efficient
layout of the RCD Zone and its proper integration with the surrounding
development are met, and a public hearing is held.
   (C)   Application and processing. Applications for Residential Cluster
Development Overlay Zone shall be processed in two stages:
      (1)   Stage I. Development Plan and Zoning Map Amendment. Applications
for amendment to RCD Overlay Zone shall include a development plan in
accordance with the requirements of division (D) of this section.
         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing
on the proposed application, duly noticed, in accordance with the requirements
of KRS Chapter 424, and review said application with regard to its compliance
with the stated purposes of the RCD Overlay Zone, the required elements of the
Stage I development plan and other applicable requirements of this section.
Upon holding such hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make one of
the following recommendations to the legislative body: approval, approval with
conditions, or disapproval. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall submit,
along with their recommendations, a copy of the Stage I development plan and
the bases for their recommendation.
         (b)   1.   The legislative body shall, within 45 days after receiving
the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission , review said
recommendations and take action to approve, or disapprove said RCD application.
Such action may incorporate any conditions imposed by the legislative body.
However, should the legislative body take action to impose different conditions
than were reviewed and considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission then
said conditions shall be resubmitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for
further review and recommendation, in accordance with division (C)(1)(a) of
this section. Approval of the RCD Overlay Zone shall require that development
be in conformance with the Stage I approved development plan.
            2.   The legislative body shall forward a copy of the approved
development plan to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further processing,
in accordance with the requirements for Stage II development plan and record
plat.
            3.   Zoning map amendment. Upon approval of the RCD Overlay Zone,
the official zoning map shall be amended by adding the prefix RCD to the
existing Residential (R) Zone (for example, RCD-R-1B, RCD-R-1C, and the like)
for the area as shown on the Stage I approved development plan.
      (2)   Stage II development plan and record plat. A Stage II development
plan and record plat shall be developed in conformity with the Stage I approved
development plan and in accordance with the requirements of division (E) of
this section, and submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its

subdivision regulations may be waived, where applicable, and the requirements
of division (E) of this section shall be substituted therefor. Those
requirements not specifically waived by the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall conform with the subdivision regulations.
         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the submitted
Stage II development plan with regard to its compliance with the required
elements of division (E)(1) of this section for a development plan, other
applicable elements of this chapter and other applicable regulations, and its
conformity with the Stage I approved development plan. The Planning and Zoning
Commission , in approving the Stage II development plan, may authorize minor
adjustments from the Stage I approved development plan, provided that the
adjustments do not affect the special relationships of structures , change land
uses, increase overall density, alter circulation patterns (vehicular and
pedestrian) or decrease the amount and/or usability of open space or recreation
areas, or affect other applicable requirements of this chapter. Upon Planning
and Zoning Commission approval of the Stage II development plan, a copy of said
plan shall be forwarded to the Zoning Administrator , who shall grant permits
only in accordance with the Stage II approved development plan and other
regulations as may be required by this chapter.
         (b)   Upon approval of the Stage II development plan, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall review the submitted record plat, with regard to its

   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the Mixed Land Use (MLU) Zone is to provide
for the combining of offices, hotels, and motels , and residential uses with
secondary retail and service uses within a planned development. Such
development is intended to be designed to provide for an internally oriented
group of activities which are functionally integrated relative to land uses,
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and the arrangement of structures . In
addition, the intent of the zone is to promote flexibility in design and
planned diversification in the relationships between location of and types of
uses and structures ; promote the advantages of modern large scale site
planning for community development through the efficient use of land,
facilitating a more economic arrangement of buildings, circulation systems,
land uses, and utilities; preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the
existing landscape features, and amenities, and to utilize such feature in a
harmonious fashion; provide for more usable and suitably located open space
facilities and common facilities than would otherwise be provided under

§ 154.100 INDUSTRIAL MINING (IM) OVERLAY ZONE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purposes of the Industrial Mining (IM) Overlay Zone are
to: permit mining, excavation or extraction operations of existing natural
resources located within the rural areas of the county (designated with the
non-urban service area on the Comprehensive Plan ); permit the treatment,
processing and manufacturing of such natural resources; and provide adequate
regulation and control of such activity to ensure that it does not adversely
impact the environment and/or surrounding uses, with the intention of
furthering the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   General. An Industrial Mining (IM) Overlay Zone is a district of
special interest (KRS 100.203(1)(e)) to the proper development of the county.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan , this overlay
zone may be permitted to be superimposed over the Agricultural- One (A-1) Zone
and HC Highway Commercial, only. Further, the IM Overlay Zone may not be
superimposed on the zones listed above unless all conditions and provisions of
this section of the chapter are met, and a public hearing is held on the IM
application.
   (C)   Application and processing. Application for an Industrial Mining
Overlay Zone shall be processed in two stages, as follows:
      (1)   Stage I plan. Application for amendment to an IM Overlay Zone shall
include a development plan, in accordance with the requirements of a Stage I
plan established in division (I) of this section and the criteria established
in division (D) of this section. The application shall then be processed as
follows:
         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing
on the proposed application in accordance with the requirements of KRS Chapter
424, and review said application with regard to its compliance with the stated
purpose of the IM Overlay Zone, the required elements of the Stage I plan
established in division (I) of this section, the criteria for evaluation of an
IM Overlay Zone in division (D) of this section, and other applicable
requirements of this section. Upon holding such hearing, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall make one of the following recommendations to the
legislative body: approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall submit along with its recommendations a
copy of the Stage I plan and the bases for its recommendations.
         (b)   1.   The legislative body shall, within 45 days after receiving
the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission , review said
recommendation and take action to approve or disapprove said IM application.
Such action may incorporate any conditions imposed by the Planning and Zoning
Commission . However, should the legislative body take action to impose
different conditions than were reviewed and considered by the Planning and
Zoning Commission , then said conditions shall be resubmitted to the Planning
and Zoning Commission for further review and recommendation in accordance with
division (C)(1)(a) of this section. Approval of the IM Overlay Zone shall
require that development be in conformance with the Stage I approved plan.
            2.   The legislative body shall forward a copy of the approved plan
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further processing in accordance with
the requirements for Stage II plan.
            3.   Zoning map amendment. Upon approval of the IM Overlay Zone,
the official zoning map shall be amended by adding the prefix "IM" to the
existing underlying zone (for example, IM-A-1) for the area as shown on the
Stage I approved plan.
      (2)   Stage II plan. A Stage II plan shall be developed in conformance
with the Stage I approved plan and in accordance with the requirements of
division (J) of this section, and submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for its review and approval as follows:
         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the submitted
Stage II plan with regard to its compliance with the required elements of
division (J) of this section, the criteria in division (E) of this section,
other applicable elements of this chapter, and other applicable regulations,
and its conformity with the Stage I plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission ,
in approving the Stage II plan, may authorize minor adjustments from the Stage
I approved plan.
         (b)   Upon Planning and Zoning Commission approval of the Stage II
plan, a copy of said plan shall be forwarded to the Zoning Administrator who
shall grant permits only in accordance with the Stage II approved plan and
other regulations as may be required by this chapter.
   (D)   Criteria for evaluation of an IM Overlay Zone. The criteria
established in this section are to be used as a basis in reviewing any
application for amendment to an IM Overlay Zone. The criteria are as follows:
      (1)   A positive finding shall be made in regard to the following
factors:
         (a)   The proposed application is in agreement with the planning
unit's Comprehensive Plan .
         (b)   The area proposed for the IM Overlay Zone consists of a minimum
size of 100 acres. However, development of a smaller tract adjacent to an
existing IM Overlay Zone may be permitted if the proposed development conforms
to and extends the original development.
         (c)   Sufficient research, testing, and other data to establish the
actual existence of the natural resource for the property in question and that
it is feasible to mine/extract said resource according to modern technical
methods.
      (2)   Consideration shall also be given to the following factors:
         (a)   Compatibility of the proposed operation with the surrounding
area. Compatibility shall be reviewed in terms of impact on the environment
(such as, visual, noise, or air pollution, dust, and the like), the intensity
of the use in relation to the general character of the surrounding area, and
the ability to maximize compatibility and protect adjacent property owners by
proposed design features (such as, provision of screening and/or earth berms,
utilization of existing natural features, and the like).
         (b)   The proposed operation would not require the provision of urban
services (for example, centralized water and sanitary sewers, and the like) in
an area that is not planned for such services.
         (c)   The amount of traffic that would be generated by the proposed
operation, including trucks, employees, and the like, which highways would be
utilized, and the ability of the existing highway system to adequately handle
said traffic. Where deficiencies exist, proposed traffic improvements that
would correct such deficiencies may be considered. Also, utilization of other
means of transportation, such as air, water, and rail, and its effect on the
surrounding areas should be considered.
   (E)   Criteria for evaluation of a Stage II plan. The following criteria
shall be used as a basis for reviewing a Stage II plan:
      (1)   The plan shall comply with the requirements of the Stage II plan
and with other applicable sections of this chapter (for example, off- street
parking requirements, industrial performance standards , and the like).
      (2)   The location of all above-ground operations shall be a minimum of
200 feet from any property boundary of the IM Zone and 200 feet from any
existing residence (an existing residence includes any structure being occupied
for ordinary living purposes; it does not include a residential structure that
has been permanently abandoned).
      (3)   Subsurface activities may not be permitted where they would
endanger above- ground uses permitted in the underlying zone , such as,
residential or agricultural uses.
      (4)   Internal access roads should be located in accordance with the
following:
         (a)   Access roads for trucks and/or employees (if the number of
employees is substantial) should be via major arterial streets , to discourage
the generation of large volumes of traffic on rural roads that are not designed
for such purposes; and
         (b)   Access to potentially dangerous operations (for example,
blasting, open excavated pit, and the like) should be designed to prevent
access by the innocent and/or curious traveler.
   (F)   Permitted uses . The following uses are permitted in the IM Overlay
Zone, in accordance with an approved Stage II plan.
      (1)   Sand, gravel, rock, clay, shale, stone, and other mineral
excavation, excluding coal, oil, gas, and other similar minerals that have
potential fire or other safety hazards.
      (2)   Treatment, processing, and manufacturing of products from the raw
natural resource permitted in division (F)(1) above, including washing and
screening plants, cement and lime manufacturing, dryers, rock crushers, asphalt
and/or concrete batching and mixing plants, warehousing operations and
facilities necessary for rail and river barging operations.
      (3)   Fire and police stations.
      (4)   Any permitted use in the underlying zone .

         (d)   Trucking terminals, related to exchange or distribution with
other modes of transportation.
   (G)   Accessory uses. Customary accessory buildings and uses are permitted
in conjunction with any permitted or conditional use in this zone (for example,
maintenance shops, offices, power plants, cafeterias, and the like).
   (H)   Height, yard , and setback regulations.
      (1)   Requirements as to height of structures , size of yards and
setbacks, on the peripheral of the IM Zone and between various proposed uses
and structure shall be as approved in the Stage II plan, but in no event shall
any above-ground operations be located closer than 200 feet from any property
boundary of the IM Zone. In determining maximum height requirements, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the type of operation and process
proposed, and alternative methods of operation and processing that are
available, to establish a reasonable requirement in each specific situation.
      (2)   In determining size of yards and setback requirements, the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall consider the distance necessary to ensure safety
(such as adequate space for vehicular access, fire protection, and the like)
and to minimize any adverse impacts on the environment.
   (I)   Stage I plan requirements. The Stage I plan shall include the
following information:
      (1)   A map of the subject property, drawn to scale, indicating the
extent of the property to be rezoned for the IM Overlay Zone. The scale of the

compliance. The property owner/developer shall have ten days to respond to the
notification and to indicate what steps he intends to take to bring the
activity into compliance.
      (2)   If immediate compliance is achieved, or if the steps to achieve
compliance are approved by the Zoning Administrator (or Planning and Zoning
Commission if it initiated this action), then no further action will be taken,
provided the approved steps are complied with (if applicable).
      (3)   If compliance is not achieved in accordance with division (S)(2) of
this section, then the Zoning Administrator or Planning and Zoning Commission
shall initiate a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of KRS
Chapter 424, and written notice of the meeting shall be sent to the property
owner/developer, by certified mail at least seven days prior to the hearing.
      (4)   At the public hearing, the property owner/developer shall have the
opportunity to present his reasons for noncompliance. Based on the information
presented, the Planning and Zoning Commission may modify the requirements that
are being violated, or, the Planning and Zoning Commission may continue the

completion of moist-mixing, 100% by dry weight passes a one-inch sieve and a
minimum of 80% passes a No. 4 sieve, exclusive of gravel or stone retained on
the sieves.
         (c)   Cement application, mixing, and spreading.
            1.   Mixing of the soil, cement, and water shall be accomplished
either by the mixed-in- place or the central-plant-mixed method.
            2.   No cement or soil-cement mixture shall be spread when the soil
or subgrade is frozen or when the air temperature is less than 40° F. in the
shade.
            3.   The percentage of moisture in the soil, at the time of cement
application, shall not exceed the quantity that will permit a uniform and
intimate mixture of soil and cement during mixing operations; and it shall not
exceed the specified optimum moisture content for the soil-cement mixture.

mixture and in unpulverized soil lumps, based on oven-dry weights, shall not be
below or more than two percentage points above the specified optimum moisture
content and shall be less than that quantity which will cause the soil-cement
mixture to become unstable during compaction and finishing. The specified
optimum moisture content and density shall be determined in the field by a
moisture-density test, AASHO T134-57 or ASTM D558-57, on representative samples
of soil- cement mixture obtained from area being processed.
            2.   Prior to the beginning of compaction, the mixture shall be in
a loose condition for its full depth. The loose moisture then shall be
uniformly compacted to the specified density within two hours. During
compaction operations, shaping may be required to obtain uniform compaction and
required grade and cross section.
         (e)   Finishing.
            1.   After compaction the surface of the soil-cement shall be
shaped to the required lines, grades, and cross section. If necessary, during
shaping operations, the surface of the base shall be lightly scarified to
remove any tire imprints or smooth surfaces left by equipment. The resulting
surface shall then be compacted to the specified density. Rolling shall be
supplemented by broom-dragging if required.
            2.   The moisture content of the surface material must be
maintained at not less than its specified optimum moisture content during
finishing operations. Surface compaction and finishing shall be done in such a
manner as to produce, in not longer than two hours, a smooth dense surface free
of compaction planes, cracks, ridges, or loose materials.
            3.   Any portion of the soil-cement that has a density of five
pounds or more below that specified shall be corrected or replaced to meet
these specifications.
         (f)   Curing.
            1.   After the soil-cement has been finished as specified herein,
it shall be protected against drying for seven days by the application of
bituminous material. The curing material shall be applied as soon as possible
but not later than 24 hours after completion of finishing operations. The
finished soil-cement shall be kept continuously moist until the curing material
is placed.
            2.   The bituminous material specified shall be uniformly applied
to the surface of the completed soil-cement at the rate of approximately 0.2
gallons per square yard with approved heating and distributing equipment.
            3.   At the time the bituminous material is applied the soil-cement
surface shall be dense, shall be free of all loose and extraneous material, and
shall contain sufficient moisture to prevent penetration of the bituminous
materials. Water shall be applied in sufficient quantity to fill the surface
voids of the soil-cement immediately before the bituminous curing material is
applied.
            4.   The curing material shall be maintained by the contractor
during the seven-day protection period so that all of the soil-cement will be
covered effectively during this period.
            5.   Sufficient protection from freezing shall be given the cement
for seven days after its construction and until it has hardened.
         (g)   Surfacing. Asphaltic concrete shall be applied to the soil-

§ 154.206 INTENT CONCERNING DETERMINATION INVOLVED IN ADMINISTRATION AND
ENFORCEMENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter that:
   (A)   Where investigation can be made by the Zoning Administrator or other
designated county employee, at the request of the Planning and Zoning
Commission using equipment normally available to the county such investigation
shall be so made before notice of violation is issued.
   (B)   Where technical complexity, non- availability of equipment, or
extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable, in the opinion of the Planning and
Zoning Commission for the county to maintain the personnel or equipment
necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures shall be
established for:
      (1)   Causing corrections in apparent violations of performance standards
;
      (2)   For protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious, and
unreasonable administration and enforcement of performance standard
regulations; and
      (3)   For protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for
administration and enforcement.
   (C)   If the Planning and Zoning Commission finds, after investigations have
been made by qualified experts, that there is a violation of the performance
standards , he shall take or cause to be taken lawful action to cause
correction to within limits set by such performance standards .
(Ord. 0-11-82, passed 11-3-82)
§ 154.207 DUTIES OF ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
   If, in the judgement of the Zoning Administrator , there is probable
violation of the performance standards as set forth in this subchapter, the
following procedures shall be followed:
   (A)   The Zoning Administrator shall give written notice, by registered mail
or certified mail, to the person or persons responsible for the alleged
violation. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation
and the reasons why the Zoning Administrator believes there is a violation in
fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation to the
satisfaction the Planning and Zoning Commission within 30 consecutive calendar
days of receipt of such notification. The notice shall state that failure to
reply or to correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Planning
and Zoning Commission within 30 consecutive calendar days of receipt of said
notice constitutes admission of violation of the terms of this chapter.
   (B)   The notice shall further state that upon request of those to whom said
notice is directed, a technical investigation will be made by a qualified
expert or experts and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such
investigations shall be charged against those responsible for the violations,
in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is
determined that no violation exists, the cost of the investigation will be paid
by the county.
   (C)   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days of receipt of
said notice, but the alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Administrator , he shall note "violation corrected" on his copy of the
notice, and shall retain it among his official records, taking such other
action as may be warranted, as to notify the Planning and Zoning Commission .
   (D)   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days of receipt of
said notice and the alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of
the Planning and Zoning Commission with the established time limited, the
Administrator shall proceed to take or cause to be taken such action as is
warranted, after receiving the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission .
   (E)   If a reply is received within 30 consecutive calendar days of receipt
of said notice indicating that the alleged violation will be corrected to the
satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning Commission , but requesting additional
time, the Planning and Zoning Commission may grant an extension if they deem it
warranted in the circumstances of the case and if the extension will not, in
their opinion, cause imminent peril to life, health, or property.
   (F)   (1)   If a reply is received within 30 consecutive calendar days of
receipt of said notice requesting technical determination as provided in this
chapter, and if the alleged violations continue, the Zoning Administrator shall
call in properly qualified experts to investigate and determine whether
violations exist, after the Planning and Zoning Commission's approval.
      (2)   If the expert findings indicate violations of the performance
standards , the costs of the investigations shall be assessed against the
properties or persons responsible for the violations in addition to such other
penalties as may be appropriate under the terms of §
154.999.
      (3)   If no violation is found, the costs of the investigations shall be
paid by the county without assessment against the properties of persons
involved.

, or city's corporation line. Subject to the foregoing limitations, every zone
shall be of at least the following size: the zoning map or maps shall not be

the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission , review said
recommendations and take action to approve or disapprove the proposed
development plan. Such approval may incorporate any conditions imposed by the
legislative body. However, should the legislative body take action to impose
different conditions than were reviewed and considered by the Planning and
Zoning Commission , then said conditions shall be resubmitted to Planning and
Zoning Commission for further review and recommendations in accordance with
division (A)(1) of this section.
         (b)   Approval of the zoning map amendment shall require that
development be in accordance with the approved development plan.
         (c)   The legislative body shall forward a copy of the approved
development plan to the Zoning Administrator or the county's duly authorized

developed in conformity with the approved development plan and in accordance
with the applicable requirements of §
154.054, and submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and
approval. The site plan may be developed and submitted in sections, in
accordance with the phasing identified in the approved development plan. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize minor adjustments from the
approved development plan, provided that the adjustments do not: affect the
spatial relationship of structures , change land uses, increase overall
density, alter circulation patterns (vehicular and pedestrian), decrease the
amount and/or usability of open space or recreation areas, or affect other
applicable requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Amendments. Any amendments to plans, except for the minor
adjustments which may be permitted by the Planning and Zoning Commission as

chapter, subject to the same limitations and requirements as those under which
such plans were originally approved.
      (3)   Expiration. The zoning map amendment shall be subject to the time
constraint, as noted below. Upon expiration of said time period and any
extensions thereto, the legislative body may initiate a request for a public
hearing by the Planning and Zoning Commission , in accordance with the
requirements of KRS Chapter 100, for the purpose of determining whether said
zoning map amendment should revert to its original designation. A public
hearing may be initiated if either of the following conditions apply.
         (a)   A site plan has not been approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission within a period of 12 consecutive months from the date of final
approval of the zoning map amendment by the legislative body; provided that an
extension may be permitted upon approval of the legislative body or its duly
authorized representative, if sufficient proof can be demonstrated that
prevailing conditions have not changed appreciably to render the approved
development plan obsolete.
         (b)   Substantial construction has not been initiated within a period
of 12 consecutive months from the date of approval of the site plan by the
Planning and Zoning Commission ; provided that an extension may be permitted
upon approval of the legislative body or its duly authorized representative, if
sufficient proof can be demonstrated that the construction was delayed due to
circumstances beyond the applicant's control and that prevailing conditions
have not changed appreciably to render the approved development plan obsolete.
The amount of construction that constitutes initiating substantial construction
shall be as approved in the approved development plan.

§ 154.260 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,

reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed other than by a court of record on application, or on notice to the
Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
(Ord. 0-11-82, passed 11-3-82)
§ 154.261 DIMENSIONAL VARIANCES.
   (A)   Dimensional variances . Before any dimensional variance is granted,
the Board of Adjustments must find all of the following, which shall be
recorded along with any imposed conditions or restrictions in its minutes and
record and issued in written form to the applicant to constitute proof of the
dimensional variance . Such dimensional variance shall not be granted by the
Board of Adjustments unless and until:
      (1)   A written application for a dimensional variance (including the
required fee as per §
154.279) and a site plan, subject to the applicable requirements of §
154.054, are submitted demonstrating:
         (a)   That specific conditions and circumstances exist which are
unique to the applicant's land and do not exist on other land in the same zone
;
         (b)   That the manner in which the strict application of the
provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of
the land in the manner equivalent to the use permitted other land owners in the
same zone ;
         (c)   That the unique conditions and circumstances are not the result
of actions of the applicant taken subsequently to the adoption of this chapter;
         (d)   Reasons that the dimensional variance will preserve, not harm,
the public safety and welfare, and will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood; and
         (e)   That granting the dimensional variance requested will not confer
on the applicant any special privilege that is not conferred by this chapter to
other lands, structures , or buildings in the same zone . No nonconforming use
of neighboring lands, and structures in the same zone shall be considered
grounds for the issuance of a dimensional variance .
      (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with §
154.258.
      (3)   The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in person ,
or by attorney.
      (4)   Prior to granting a dimensional variance :
         (a)   The Board of Adjustments shall make findings that the
requirements of this section have been met by the applicant for a dimensional
variance .
         (b)   The Board of Adjustments shall further make a finding that
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of dimensional
variance and that the dimensional variance is the minimum variance that will
make possible the reasonable use of the land, building , or structure , and
under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustments :
            1.   Grant a dimensional variance which would vary by more than 50%
of the applicable regulation when the development is occurring in newly platted
areas; and
            2.   Grant a dimensional variance which would vary by more than 50%
of the average height, yard , and setback of existing surrounding development
when the proposed obstruction occurs on lots or parcels of land already platted
and where more than 51% of said lots or parcels of land are improved with
structures , then said development shall be governed by the requirements of
division 1. above.
         (c)   The Board of Adjustments shall further make a finding that the
granting of the dimensional variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter as well as the Adopted Comprehensive Plan
for the County and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
      (5)   In granting any dimensional variance , the Board of Adjustments may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made part of the
terms under which the dimensional variance is granted, shall be deeded a
violation of this chapter and punishable under §
154.999 of this chapter.
   (B)   Dimensional variance cannot contradict zoning regulation. The Board of
Adjustments shall not possess the power to grant a dimensional variance to
permit a use of any land, building , or structure which is not permitted by
this chapter in the zone in question, or to alter the density of dwelling unit
requirements in the zone in question.
   (C)   Dimensional variance runs with land. A dimensional variance applies to
the property for which it is granted and not to the individual who applied for
it. A dimensional variance also runs with the land and is transferable to any
future owner of land, but it cannot be transferred by the applicant to a
different site.
   (D)   Change from one nonconforming use to another. A nonconforming use
shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without the specific approval
of the Board of Adjustments , as provided herein. The Board of Adjustments
shall have the power to hear and decide on applications to convert or change an
existing nonconforming use to another nonconforming use , subject to the
following:
      (1)   A written application for a change from one nonconforming use to
another (including the required fee as per §
154.279) and a site plan, if applicable, subject to the applicable requirements
of §
154.054 shall be submitted to the Board;
      (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with §
154.258;
      (3)   The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in person ,
or by attorney;
      (4)   Prior to granting a change from one nonconforming use to another
the Board of Adjustments shall find that the new nonconforming use is in the
same or more restrictive classification of use as the prior nonconforming use .
In the determination of the same or more restrictive classification of use, the
applicant shall establish and the Board of Adjustments shall find as provided
in KRS 100.253(2) and as outlined by the following:
         (a)   That the new nonconforming use shall generate less vehicular
traffic (automobile and truck) than the prior nonconforming use ;
         (b)   That the new nonconforming use is of a nature which will emit
less noise and air pollution than the prior nonconforming use ;
         (c)   That the new nonconforming use will be more in character with
the existing neighborhood than the prior nonconforming use , in that it is more
in conformance with the Adopted Comprehensive Plan of the County and also, more
in conformance with the uses permitted in the zone in which the use is located,
than the prior nonconforming use .
      (5)   Any change of nonconforming use granted by the Board of Adjustments
shall conform to the requirements of this chapter, including, but not limited
to: parking requirements, sign regulations and yard requirements, and all other
pertinent ordinances of the county.
      (6)   The Board of Adjustments shall not allow the enlargement or
extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at
which time its use became nonconforming.
      (7)   The Board of Adjustments , in granting a change of nonconforming
uses , may attach such conditions thereto as it may deem necessary and proper;
and the action, limitations, and conditions imposed, if any, shall be in
writing, directed to the applicant, with a copy to be furnished to the Zoning
Administrator's office.
      (8)   The change of nonconforming use as may be granted by the Board of
Adjustments applies to the property for which it is granted and not to the
individual who applied and, therefore, cannot be transferred by the applicant
to a different property.
      (9)   In the case where the change of nonconforming use has not occurred
within one year after the date of granting thereof; then, without further
action, the change of nonconforming use adjustment shall have to be made.

§ 154.262 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   Conditional use permits shall not be issued without specific approval of the
Board of Adjustments , as provided herein. The Board of Adjustments shall have
the power to hear and decide on applications for conditional use permits ,
subject to the following:

required fee, as per §
154.279) and a site plan subject to the applicable requirements of §

decide in favor of the applicant or any matter upon which it is required to
pass under this chapter, or to effect any variation in the application of this
chapter.
