TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES
§ 70.15 SIGNAL LEGENDS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend or symbolic message, and
said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as
follows.
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right
or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a
turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
      (4)   Vehicular traffic that entered an intersection on a circular green
or yellow indication is allowed to complete a left turn during the red
indication.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian-control signal, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no
pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then before entering the crosswalk or
the near side to the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown,
except as follows:
         (a)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by this
paragraph with the intention of making a right turn, may make such right turn,
after stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such
movement, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic
lawfully proceeding through the intersection;
         (b)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by this
paragraph whose vehicle is in the left lane of a one-way highway with the
intention of making a left turn onto the left lane of another one-way highway
with the flow of traffic, may make such left turn, after stopping, unless an
official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding through the
intersection; and
         (c)   In instances where there are two (2) right or left turn lanes,
an allowable turn under this division may be made from either lane unless a
regulatory sign specifically prohibits it.
      (2)   The city may, by ordinance, prohibit any such right or left turn
against a steady red signal at any intersection, which prohibition shall be
effective when an official sign prohibiting such movement is erected at the
intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicated where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (E)   Whenever an illuminate flashing red or yellow light is used in a
traffic signal or with a traffic sign it shall require obedience by vehicular
traffic as follows:
      (1)   Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with
rapid intermittent flashes, operators of vehicles shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side
of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting
roadway where the operator has view of approaching traffic on the intersecting
roadway before entering it, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the
rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign; and
      (2)   Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, operators of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   (F)   Any person operating a motorcycle who violates division (C) of this
section by entering or crossing an intersection controlled by a traffic control
signal against a steady red light shall have an affirmative defense to that
charge if the person establishes all of the following conditions:
      (1)   The motorcycle was brought to a complete stop;
      (2)   The traffic control signal continued to show a steady red light for
120 seconds or the traffic control signal at the intersection has completed two
lighting cycles;
      (3)   The traffic control signal was apparently malfunctioning or, if
programmed or engineered to change to a green light only after detecting the
approach of a motor vehicle, the signal apparently failed to detect the arrival
of a motorcycle; and
      (4)   No motor vehicle or person was approaching on the street or highway
to be crossed or entered, or any approaching person or vehicle was so far away
from the intersection that it did not constitute an immediate hazard.
   (G)   The affirmative defense outlined in division (F) of this section shall
only apply to a violation for entering or crossing an intersection controlled
by a traffic signal against a steady red light and shall not provide a defense
to any other civil or criminal action.
   (H)   In the event a motorcyclist exercises the affirmative defense
provisions set forth in division (F) of this section, the Transportation
Cabinet or its employees are specifically immune from any and all civil
liability arising from any such claim, lawsuit or dispute. Any claim, lawsuit,
or dispute against the transportation Cabinet as a result of the affirmative
defense set forth in division (F) of this section, shall be brought using the
provisions outlined in KRS Chapter 44.
(KRS 189.338) Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.16 ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES.
   The city shall establish and maintain all official traffic-control devices
necessary within the city. All traffic-control devices, including signs, shall
be employed to indicate one particular warning or regulation, shall be uniform,
and as far as possible shall be placed uniformly. All traffic-control devices
and signs shall conform to required state specifications.
§ 70.17 OBEDIENCE TO SIGNALS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to disobey the
signal of any official traffic-control device placed in accordance with the
provisions of this traffic code or of a traffic barrier or sign erected by any
of the public departments or public utilities of the city, or any electric
signal, gate, or watchman at railroad crossings, unless otherwise directed by a
police officer. However, the type and the right to or necessity for such
barrier or sign must be approved by the city.
   (B)   Such sign, signal, marking, or barrier shall have the same authority
as the personal direction of a police officer.
Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.18 INTERFERENCE WITH SIGNALS.
   No person shall without authority attempt to or in fact alter, deface,
injure, knock down, or remove any official control device or any railroad sign
or signal, or any inscription, shield, or insignia thereon, or any part
thereof.
Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.19 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNALS OR MARKINGS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to place, maintain, or display on
or in view of any street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the
movement of traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or interferes with
the effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or
signal. No person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority
permit on any street, any traffic sign or signal bearing any commercial
advertising. Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting any
public department or public utility of the city in any emergency or temporarily
from marking or erecting any traffic barrier or sign whose placing has been
approved by the city.
   (B)   Every such prohibited sign, signal, or marking is declared to be a
public nuisance and the city is empowered forthwith to remove it or cause it to
be removed.
Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.20 DEVICE TO BE LEGIBLE AND IN PROPER POSITION.
   No provision of this traffic code for which signs or any other traffic-
control device is required shall be enforceable against an alleged violator if
at the time and place of the alleged violation the required device was not in
proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant
person.
§ 70.21 TEMPORARY DISREGARD OF DEVICES BY POLICE OFFICERS.
   In an emergency any police officer may at his discretion disregard traffic-
control lights or signals or established regulations in order to facilitate the
movement of traffic.
§ 70.99 GENERAL PENALTY.

      (1)   "DANGEROUS ANIMAL."
         (a)   Any animal which constitutes a physical threat to human beings
or other domestic animals by virtue of a known or displayed propensity to
endanger by pursuing, wounding, or attacking any other domestic animal or human
being, whether or not such dangerous animal bears any license tag required by
state law. However, an animal shall not be deemed dangerous if it bites,
attacks, or menaces anyone assaulting its owner or any person or other animal

from a person or other animal upon the owner or other person; or it is
protecting or defending its young or other domestic animal.

primarily or in part, of animal fighting.

Cross reference:
   Community improvement division, see §

   Riverfest, animals, see §
100.20
   (B)   Responsibility of all animal owners. It shall be the duty of every
owner of any animal, or anyone having any animal in his possession or custody,
to exercise reasonable care and to take all necessary steps and precautions to
protect other people, property, and animals from injuries or damages which
might result from their animal's behavior, regardless of whether such behavior
is motivated by mischievousness, playfulness, or ferocity.
   (C)   Parent or guardian liability. In the event the owner or keeper of any
animal is a minor, the parent or guardian of such minor shall be responsible to
insure that all provisions of this section are met.
   (D)   Duty to keep animal under restraint. It shall be the duty of every
owner of any animal, or anyone having any animal in his possession or custody,
to insure that the animal is kept under restraint and that reasonable care and
precautions are taken to prevent the animal from leaving, while unattended, the
real property limits of its owner, possessor, or custodian, and that it is
securely and humanely enclosed within a house, building, fence, pen, or other
enclosure out of which it cannot climb, dig, jump, or otherwise escape of its
own volition. Such enclosure must be securely locked at any time the animal is
left unattended, or the animal must be securely and humanely restrained by
chain, cable and trolley, or other tether of sufficient strength to prevent
escape, or the animal must be on a leash under the control of a competent
person.
   (E)   Additional requirements for owners of dangerous animals. Whenever a
dangerous animal is outside of its enclosure as provided herein but on the
owner's property, it must be attended by the owner and restrained by a secure
collar and leash of sufficient strength to prevent its escape. No dangerous
animal shall be chained, tethered, or otherwise tied to any inanimate object,
such as a tree, post, or building outside of its own enclosure as provided
herein. For those owners of dangerous animals who maintain their animal out-of-
doors, a portion of their property must be fenced with a perimeter or area
fence. Within this perimeter fence, the dangerous animal must be humanely
confined inside a pen or kennel of adequate size. The pen or kennel may not
share common fencing with the area or perimeter fence. The kennel or fence must
have secure sides, a secure top attached to all sides, and the sides must
either be buried two (2) feet into the ground, sunken into a concrete pad, or
securely attached to a wire bottom. The gate to the kennel must be locked.
   (F)   (1)   Duty to keep animal under restraint while off property. It shall
be the duty of the owner of any animal or anyone having an animal in his
possession to keep the animal under restraint and in control at all times while
the animal is off the real property limits of the owner, possessor, or
custodian. For purposes of this section, the animal is deemed under control
when:
         (a)   It is securely confined within a vehicle, whether parked or in
motion;
         (b)   It is properly confined within a secure enclosure with the
permission of the owner of the property where the enclosure is located; or
         (c)   It is securely restrained by a leash or other device held by a
competent person.
      (2)   Except when being transported in, and securely confined within a
vehicle, no dangerous animal shall be permitted off the property of his owner
except when it is:
         (a)   Attended by its owner;
         (b)   Restrained by a secure collar and leash (not to exceed six (6)
feet in length), both collar and leash to be of sufficient strength to prevent
escape; and
         (c)   Muzzled by sufficient means to prevent its biting other persons
or domestic animals.
Cross-reference:
   Riverfest, animals, see §
100.20
   (G)   Enforcement of restrictions. In the event that any law enforcement
officer has probable cause to believe that a dangerous animal is being harbored
in violation of this section, he may:
      (1)   Order the violation immediately corrected and cite the owner or
keeper to appear in court for the violation, or
      (2)   If the violation cannot be immediately corrected and the animal is
posing an imminent serious threat to human beings or other domestic animals,
the animal may be seized and impounded, in which case the owner or keeper will
be cited to appear in court for the violation. At the owner's request and
expense, such impoundment may be at a veterinarian or licensed kennel of the
owner's choosing. If the court rules that the animal is not dangerous as
defined, it will be released to the owner. If the court rules that it is
dangerous as defined, the animal will be released to the owner after payment of
any fees and penalties, and upon presentation of proof that the animal will now
be kept restrained or confined as specified in this section.
         (a)   If the owner or keeper of any alleged dangerous animal impounded
for violation of this section presents proof that the animal will now be kept
in compliance with this section, the animal will be released upon payment of
any fees and penalties due.
         (b)   If the owner or keeper of an alleged dangerous animal fails to
either provide proof that the animal will now be kept restrained or confined in
compliance with the provisions of this section, or fails to reclaim it after
impoundment, and if it cannot be adopted by someone providing proof that it
will be kept restrained or confined as specified in this section, it will be
humanely euthanized.
   (H)   Warning signs. All owners, keepers, or harborers of any guard dog or
dangerous animal shall display in a prominent place on their premises, and at
each entrance or exit to the area where such animal is confined, a sign easily
readable by the public using the words "Beware of Dangerous Animal" or "Beware
of Dog."
   (I)   Complaint procedure. Any person who has been pursued or attacked by an
allegedly dangerous animal, or anyone on behalf of such person, may make a
complaint before the Dangerous Animal Officer or district court, charging the
owner, possessor, or custodian of such animal with harboring a dangerous
animal. A copy of such complaint shall be served upon the person so charged in
the same matter and subject to the laws regulating the service of summons in
civil cases, or by any law enforcement officer of the city with a return
receipt, directing such person to appear before the district court for a
hearing of such complaint at a time fixed.
      (1)   If upon a hearing of the parties and their witnesses, the court
finds the person so charged is the owner, possessor, or guardian of the animal
in question, and that such animal has without cause pursued, wounded, or
attacked a human being or other domestic animal, the court shall declare such
animal a dangerous animal and order the owner, possessor, or guardian to
henceforth keep such dangerous animal securely confined as set forth herein,
and impose the penalties set forth in § 90.99.
      (2)   If a subsequent complaint is filed against the same owner,
possessor, or guardian for an animal previously determined or found to be a
dangerous animal, and the court finds the person so charged is in violation
hereof, the court shall order the owner, possessor, or guardian of said
dangerous animal to immediately remove the animal from the city or order the
animal humanely euthanized.
   (J)   Complaint form. The complaint form to be used shall be as follows:

applicant cannot meet the criteria established herein, or if abutting neighbors
object to the application prior to a permit being issued.
      (4)   A denial of a permit may be appealed to the City Administrator
within thirty (30) days of the denial.

§ 93.39 TYPE AND REPLACEMENT OF SMOKE DETECTORS.
   (A)   (1)   In order to comply with this subchapter, only ionization or
photo electric type detectors approved by a nationally-recognized testing
laboratory shall be installed.
      (2)   Alternatives. As an alternative to self-contained smoke detectors,
under certain limited conditions (for example, battery powered smoke
detectors), an approved fire detection system or a combination thereof may be
installed. The Fire Chief may subjectively, and on a case-by-case basis,
approve each and every alternative system in written form.
   (B)   Smoke detectors in new residential dwellings shall be wired directly
(hard wired) to the building's power supply. In existing buildings, it is
preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power supply; however,
these detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery or operated by an
electrical plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device,
provided that the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the main
power supply.
   (C)   Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with applicable N.F.P.A.

kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section, In a
dwelling unit which contains a well-defined sleeping room separated from the
other activity areas of the same unit, the detector shall be located in the
corridor within the unit or interior area giving direct access to the rooms
used for sleeping purposes. Where sleeping areas are separated or where a
single smoke detector will not adequately service all sleeping areas, there
shall be smoke detectors installed adjacent to each sleeping area.
   (E)   In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally located on the
ceiling.
   (F)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any rooming
unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each
dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally located
common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately service all sleeping
areas.
   (G)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed in or near each
stairway leading up to an occupied area in a manner as to assure that rising
smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector and the detector intercepts
rising smoke before it reaches the occupied areas.
(Ord. 87-6-6, passed 6-24-87)   Penalty, see § 93.99
§ 93.40 PROVIDING, INSTALLING, AND MAINTAINING SMOKE DETECTORS.
   (A)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for supplying and
installing in an operable condition the required detectors and for providing
maintenance and testing in an owner occupied residence; or for providing the
manufacturer's maintenance and testing instructions to a tenant in the case of
rental property.
   (B)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for maintenance and
testing of detectors, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, which are
located in common areas or detectors in rooming units where the tenant usually
has short periods of occupancy (hotels, motels, rooming, or tourist homes).
   (C)   The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and testing the
detector, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, which are within
his exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant shall be
responsible for notifying, in writing, the owner when a detector becomes
inoperable, whereafter the owner has ten days in which to repair or replace in
operable condition those detectors. In the battery-operated type of detector,
battery replacement shall be the responsibility of the tenant.
   (D)   At every change of tenancy, it shall be the duty of the owner to test
and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition prior to renting the unit.
   (E)   At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by or
incidental to a sale, lease, or sublease of a unit, it shall be the duty of the
grantor thereof (for example, the seller, lessor, or sublessor, as the case may
be) to provide, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke detectors
as required by this section (or other applicable laws) are installed and in
proper working condition. Failure to comply with this division shall be
punishable as set forth herein; however, this division shall not be construed
to violate or render void any contract, lease, or sublease subject hereto.
   (F)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly connected
(permanently wired) to the electrical system of a structure without the proper
electrical certification.

nature shall be issued on behalf of the city in regard to the condition of or
any activity within any dwelling unit unless smoke detectors have been
installed and located therein according to the requirements and specifications
hereof.

property is declared a public nuisance and in violation of this subchapter and
subject to the remedies provided herein; and

(Ord. 2012-11-01, passed 12-12-12)   Penalty, see § 95.99
§ 95.22 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE FOR CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTIES.
   (A)   When the Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her designee(s), receives
information documenting the existence of activities which qualify as nuisance
activities: (1) the Code Enforcement Officer or Police Chief, or their designee
(s), shall independently review the information to determine whether a chronic
nuisance property, as defined herein in §
95.20, is established by the information; and (2) upon such determination, the
Code Enforcement Officer or Police Chief, or their designers), shall issue a
notice of violation to the person responsible for such property, in writing,
that the property is in danger of being declared a chronic nuisance property.
   (B)   The notice shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property;
      (2)   A concise statement that the property has been determined to be a
chronic nuisance property with a description of the nuisance activities leading
to the determination;
      (3)   A demand that the person responsible for such property respond to
the notice within ten (10) days of service of the notice by describing the
actions the person intends to take to abate the nuisance activities (an
abatement plan), or indicating good cause as to why the responsible person
cannot abate the nuisance activities;
      (4)   Advising that an abatement plan must be reached with the Code
Enforcement Officer or his or her designee within thirty (30) days from the
date of the notice of determination or chronic nuisance property;
      (5)   That if the nuisance activities are not abated or good cause for
failure to abate is not shown, a citation may be issued;
      (6)   That permitting the existence of a chronic nuisance property is a
violation of this subchapter;
      (7)   That the above remedies are in addition to those otherwise provided
by law; and
      (8)   A statement describing that the property could be subject to
closure and civil penalties and/or costs assessed up to two hundred dollars
($200.00) per day if the property is declared a chronic nuisance property.
   (C)   The notice may be delivered in person or sent registered mail with
return receipt requested. The notice may be delivered to the property itself,
or to the mailing address of the owner of the property as listed on city tax
roll or to any other address that is likely to give the person responsible
notice of the determination and notice of violation. Failure of the person to
receive the notice shall not invalidate or otherwise alter the proceedings
under this subchapter.
   (D)   Failure to respond, failure to abate the nuisance activities, or
failure to propose an abatement plan shall be prima facie evidence of lack of
cooperativeness of the person responsible. Failure to implement or comply with
any abatement plan shall be prima facie evidence of an absence of good faith in
mitigating or connecting the chronic nuisance violation.
   (E)   The Code Enforcement Officer or his or her designee may issue a
citation if: (1) the responsible person fails to respond within ten (10) days
from the date of notice of violation and chronic nuisance property
determination; or (2) no agreeable written abatement plan is reached within
thirty (30) days from the notice of violation and determination of chronic
nuisance property by the Code Enforcement Officer or his or her designee and

provided in § 95.20, Nuisance Activity or Activities, subsection (3), divisions
(G), (H) or (I) of this section; or (3) the responsible person fails to abate
the nuisance activities from the property as required by the agreed abatement
plan; or (4) the responsible person fails to comply with all conditions of the
written abatement plan for a period of one (1) year.
   (F)   A timely response and statement from a responsible person does not
constitute an admission that any nuisance activities have occurred or are
occurring but may be used as evidence and considered by any trier of fact for
any purpose.
   (G)   Landlord's affirmative defense. A residential landlord has an
affirmative defense to a violation under this subchapter if they establish by a
preponderance of the evidence that the basis for the charge is the actions or
omissions of a tenant(s) and the residential landlord establishes the
following:
   (H)   That the residential landlord, upon written notice by the city that a
nuisance activity has occurred on the property within the prior three hundred
sixty-five (365) days, commences an eviction action against the tenant whose
action or omission forms the basis of the charge, and diligently prosecutes
that action to completion, irrespective of any ultimate ruling by a court on
the merits of the action.
   (I)   Good cause affirmative defense. Any person charged under this
subchapter has an affirmative defense to a violation under this subchapter if
they establish by a preponderance of the evidence that;
      (1)   The responsible person has taken all actions to deter and prevent
the nuisance activity that formed the basis of the violation;
      (2)   The nuisance activity that forms the basis of the citation was not
the result of the actions or omissions of the responsible person, their
authorized guests, tenants or any other person residing in their household; and
      (3)   The nuisance activity that forms the basis of the citation was not
suffered, permitted or tolerated by the responsible person.
(Ord. 2012-11-01, passed 12-12-12)   Penalty, see §
95.99
§ 95.23 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   When a citation is issued for a chronic nuisance property, the
responsible person shall have those rights and be subject to the procedures and
provisions set forth in §§
35.90 et seq. of The Bellevue Kentucky Code of Ordinances. If the Code
Enforcement Board finds that the real property is a chronic nuisance property,
then it shall issue such civil fine or order any other action consistent with
the provisions of §§
35.90 et seq.
   (B)   Whenever the Code Enforcement Board finds, or a citation is not
appealed, that a chronic nuisance property exists, the Board or Code
Enforcement Official shall forward the finding to the Mayor. Based on such
determination, the Mayor may suspend or revoke any occupational license and
rental license of any person conducting any business upon the chronic nuisance
property.
(Ord. 2012-11-01, passed 12-12-12)
§ 95.24 SUMMARY CLOSURE.
   The city may also initiate a summary closure proceeding in Campbell District
and/or Circuit Court. Such an action shall be based on evidence showing that
nuisance activities exist and have occurred on the property and that action is
necessary to avoid a threat to public welfare and safety. Proceedings to obtain
an order of summary closure shall be governed by applicable Kentucky law for
obtaining temporary restraining orders. In the event of summary closure, the
city is not required to comply with the notification procedures of §§
35.90 et seq. As part of any summary closure order, the District/Circuit Court
may revoke or suspend the occupational license of any person conducting
business upon the property where the chronic nuisance exists.

and public ways of the City of Bellevue; revoke the certificate of occupancy of
the premises; or use any other legal remedy available under the laws of the
state.

95.99
§ 95.26 RELIEF FROM ORDER.
   The Code Official may vacate or suspend the provisions of an order to close

activity has been abated and will not be maintained or permitted on the
property or a unit thereof.
(Ord. 2012-11-01, passed 12-12-12)
§ 95.27 LIEN.
   Pursuant to the provisions KRS 381.770, the City of Bellevue shall possess a
lien against the property for all fines, penalties, charges and fees imposed
and for the reasonable value of labor and materials used to abate the nuisance
activity. The lien shall be superior to and have priority over all other liens
on the property except state, City of Bellevue, school board and City of
Bellevue taxes, and may be enforced by judicial proceeding.

§ 95.37 DEFENSES AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   If an owner (or legal tenant) reports an illegal activity that leads

§ 95.38 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE FOR CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTIES.
   (A)   Duty of Police Department. The Bellevue Police shall, as soon as
possible but not less than every thirty (30) days after criminally citing or
arresting persons or executing court-issued search warrants for crimes included
in the definition of a criminal nuisance violation, notify the Code Enforcement
Officer in writing of the specific violation investigated, the address of the
property on or in which the violations occurred, and the circumstances of the
violation. After the police notify the Code Enforcement Officer of the criminal
nuisance violation at a property for the first time, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall notify the owner of the criminal nuisance violation by regular
U.S. mail,
   (B)   Notice. Whenever the Code Enforcement Officer receives information
that a criminal activity nuisance exists in or upon a property, i.e., a second
criminal nuisance violation has occurred at the property, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall notify the owner that the property is a criminal activity
nuisance and that the nuisance must be abated (the "Notice"). The notice shall
be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested and by regular mail. If
the Notice by certified mail is not accepted or received by the owner, then
notice may be served by personal delivery upon the owner. If the whereabouts of
the owner are unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Code Enforcement Officer
in the exercise of reasonable diligence, or if the whereabouts of the owner are
known and he or she refuses to accept the notice, then the Code Enforcement
Officer shall make an affidavit to that effect, and thereafter may serve the
notice by posting a copy of it in a conspicuous place on the property, and by
sending a copy of the Notice by regular U.S. mail to the owner's last known
mailing address, by newspaper publication, pursuant to KRS Chapter 424, and by
recording the notice in the real estate records of the Campbell County Clerk's
Office.
   (C)   Abatement.
      (1)   Should the criminal activity nuisance not be abated at the time
stated in the notice, or by any extension granted by the city or its agencies,
the Code Enforcement Officer shall be authorized at any time thereafter to
issue an order closing and vacating the property, or portions thereof, to the
extent necessary to abate the criminal activity nuisance ("Order"). Such
closing and vacating shall be for such period as the Code Enforcement Officer
reasonably may direct, but in no event shall the closing and vacating be for a
period of more than one (1) year from the date of the order. An order issued
hereunder is not an act of possession, ownership, or control by the city.
      (2)   If the property contains multi-unit dwellings, multiple tenants, or
mixed uses and the criminal activity nuisance has occurred solely within a unit
or units, the order shall be restricted to the unit(s) in which the criminal
activity nuisance has occurred, and shall not extend to any other unit on the
property.
      (3)   Upon the issuance of an order, a copy of the order shall be served
on the owner in the same manner as the notice and a copy shall be conspicuously
posted on the property.
      (4)   If an owner fails to comply with an order issued hereunder, the
Code Enforcement Officer may:
         (a)   Prohibit the furnishing of utility service, including but not
limited to gas, electric, water, and heating oil, to the Property by any public
utility holding a franchise to use the streets and public ways of the city;
         (b)   Revoke the Certificate of Occupancy of the property or the
Occupational License of a business occupying or operating the property; or
         (c)   Use any other legal remedy available under the laws of the
Commonwealth and the city's ordinances.
      (5)   Relief from order. The Code Enforcement Officer may vacate or
suspend the provisions of an order upon a showing by clear and convincing
evidence that the criminal activity nuisance has been abated and the owner has
taken steps to insure that additional violations will not be permitted at the
property.
      (6)   Abatement actions not in violation of law. Actions taken by an
owner to abate a criminal activity nuisance shall not be deemed to be
violations of any fair housing laws or other landlord/tenant statutes or
ordinances.
      (7)   Other remedies available. Enforcement of this subchapter does not
impair or restrict the ability of the city to bring a separate action to revoke
the occupational license of a landlord or business that allows a criminal
activity nuisance to exist on the property or to bring an action before the
Code Enforcement Board for the imposition of civil fines. No civil fines will
be assessed by the Code Enforcement Board until after notice is sent pursuant
to division (B) of this section or if an eviction proceeding has been
instituted pursuant to §
95.37(C) of this subchapter.
      (8)   Appeals. All orders and civil fines may be appealed to the Code
Enforcement Board.
(Ord. 2012-05-01, passed 6-13-12)
§ 95.39 LIEN.

proposed development. The Planning and Zoning Commission may permit the removal
of a tree outside the buildable area, provided the removal of the tree is
reasonably required to develop the parcel in compliance with this chapter.
   (B)   (1)   All trees to be saved outside of the buildable area of a
development shall be conspicuously designated with suitable protective barriers
as designated herein or as otherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator.
Approved tree protective barriers shall be installed along the outermost
dripline around the tree protection zone. The use of tree protection zones if
encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen) trees that
may be scattered throughout a development site.
      (2)   The layout of development improvements, utilities, access drives,
grading, and the like of a site shall accommodate the required tree protective
zones. The public improvements shall be placed along the corridors between tree
protective zones unless the placement of same causes undue hardship on the

and Zoning commission determines that public improvements and/or utilities may
be placed within a tree protective zone, the installation of same shall occur
by way of tunneling rather than trenching.
      (3)   Construction site activities including, but not limited to material
storage, parking, or concrete washout shall not encroach into any tree
protection zone without the prior approval of the Zoning Administrator. Any
tree irreparably damaged or killed within a tree protection zone as a result of

planted predominately in the developed areas. driveway aisles, and/or parking
areas of the project. In no case shall more than fifty percent (50%) of the
trees required to be planted be utilized to satisfy the screening requirements
of a development. The exact location of the trees to be planted and species
shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission as part of the Stage I
review process. Whenever the owner/developer can demonstrate to the Planning
and Zoning Commission that the site spacial constraints result in an absolute
inability to plant the required number of trees, as many trees as possible
shall be planted on the site. The difference of those trees required to be
planted, and those trees planted shall be donated to the city for use
elsewhere, in the city on public property. A reduction credit on one tree or
more shall be granted to an owner/developer when either of the following
conditions exist.
         (a)   For every tree saved within the buildable area of a development
eight (8) inches or more in diameter, or

(Ord. 2007-12-01, passed 12-19-07)
§ 110.07 EXEMPTED ACTIVITIES.
   The occupational license fee imposed in this chapter shall not apply to the
following persons or business entities:
   (A)   Any bank, trust company, combined bank and trust company, or trust,
banking and title insurance company organized and doing business in this state,
any savings and loan association whether state or federally chartered;
   (B)   Any compensation received by members of the Kentucky National Guard
for training, unit training assemblies, annual field training and active duty;
   (C)   Any compensation received by precinct workers for election training or
work at election booths in state, county, and local primary, regular, or
special elections;
   (D)   Public Service Corporations that pay an ad valorem tax on property
valued and assessed by the Kentucky Department of Revenue pursuant to the
provisions of KRS 136.120. Licensees whose businesses are predominantly non-
public service who are also engaged in public service activity are required to
pay a license fee on their gross receipts derived from the non-public service
activities apportioned to the city;
   (E)   Persons or business entities that have been issued a license under KRS
Chapter 243 to engage in manufacturing or trafficking in alcoholic beverages.
Persons engaged in the business of manufacturing or trafficking in alcoholic
beverages are required to file a return, but may exclude the portion of their
gross receipts derived from the manufacturing or trafficking in alcoholic
beverages;
   (F)   Insurance companies incorporated or doing business under the laws of
the Commonwealth of Kentucky;
   (G)   A minister of religion who has been ordained in accordance with the
ceremonial ritual or discipline of a recognized church, religious sect, or
religious organization, to teach and preach its religious doctrines or to
administer its rights in public worship, in the performance of one or more of
those duties. However, it is not intended to exempt an ordained minister of
religion from the necessity of paying a license fee for work done or services
performed in the city in activities not connected with his or her regular
duties as a minister of religion.
   (H)   No church, religious congregation, or religious society of any creed
is required to withhold or deduct any sum from the wages, salaries,
commissions, or other compensation due by the church, religious congregation,
or religious society to its employees as salaries, wages, commissions, or other
compensation. However, this failure to so withhold by such employers shall not
relieve the employees of the churches, religious congregations, or religious
societies from the payment of license fees required by this chapter.
   (I)   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any business,
occupation, or profession which is exempt from municipal licensing or license
taxes pursuant to state or federal law.
   (J)   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to vendors
participating in flea market events sponsored by any non-profit, charitable
organization with 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status as designated by the Internal
Revenue Service, located within the city, where such event is held entirely
upon or within property owned or controlled by such non-profit, charitable
organization. This exemption shall only apply to one flea market event per year
for each non-profit, charitable organization located within the city sponsoring
the event. The event shall not exceed one calendar day in duration. The non-
profit, charitable organization sponsoring the event shall comply with §
118.02 that requires a yard sale permit.
   (K)   Any usual activities of Boards of Trade, Chambers of Commerce, trade
associations or unions, Community Chest funds or foundations, corporations or
associations organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable,
scientific, literary, educational or civic purpose, or for the prevention of
cruelty to children or animals; or clubs or fraternal organizations operated
exclusively for social, literary, educational or fraternal purposes where no
part of the income or receipts of such units, groups, or associations insures
to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. To qualify for this
exemption the organization must submit satisfactory proof of their exempt
status for federal income tax purposes. If any part of the earnings of such
business inures to the benefit of any person, it shall be sufficient to defeat
the exemption. If an organization earns “unrelated business income” as defined
and administered in § 511 of the Internal Revenue Code, the occupational
license fee shall be assessed on the “unrelated business income.”

§ 110.08 APPORTIONMENT OF GROSS RECEIPTS IN CALCULATING FEE DUE.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) below, gross receipts shall be
apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the gross receipts by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) below, plus
the sales factor, described in division (C) below, and the denominator of which
shall be two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the gross receipts by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) below.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of gross receipts. The city must approve any
alternate apportionment method prior to its implementation by the business
entity. Once an alternate apportionment method is approved by the city, the
business entity must apply such apportionment scheme in all future tax years,
unless otherwise directed by the city.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license fee shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license fee shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this division,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license fee imposed in this chapter is assessed against gross receipts before
it is “passed through” these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license fee shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.
   (H)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses it charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation or business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat or excuse the requirement to file returns nor the assessment and
collection any occupational license fee for the period of that taxable year
during which the business entity had business activity in the city.
(Ord. 2007-12-01, passed 12-19-07)

   (A)   Each employer who employs one or more person(s) working within the
city is required to obtain an occupational license and, if applicable, shall

   (E)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (F)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold a fees under this
section shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file

information, as determined by the city, shall be submitted.
   (G)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or before
January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license fee deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee
for payment to the city during the preceding calendar year.
   (H)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the fee required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (I)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this section shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any fee required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the fee becomes or became
obligated.
   (J)   Notwithstanding divisions (H) and (I) above, every employee receiving
compensation in the city subject to the fee imposed under §
110.06 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the fee levied under this chapter from the employee,
such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the city each
quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer.

employer required to have an occupational license from the city shall provide
to the city all information necessary to assess the appropriate occupational

   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license fee governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns, and comply with rules and regulations as the city
from time to time may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city
may require a business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make
a return, render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems
sufficient to determine the fee liability of the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purpose of making an estimate of the taxable income of
any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business entity
or of any other person having knowledge of the business entity or on the

   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid fee payable by any person or business
entity, as appears from the face of the return and without regard to any
extension of time for filing the return, shall be paid to the city at the time

   (F)   Every business entity making payments of $600 or more to persons other
than employees for services performed within the city are responsible for
maintaining records of those payments and for completing Form 1099 SF,

before the date prescribed for payment of the occupational license fee,
requests the extension and pays the amount properly estimated as its fee. All
requests for an extension shall be made in writing.

rehabilitated.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in Kentucky Revised
Statutes delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Bellevue, Kentucky,
hereby adopts the following floodplain management chapter, as follows:
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)
§ 152.03 PURPOSE; OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to
flooding by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion, or in flood heights, or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve those uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood- prone areas in a
manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
      (7)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)

annual chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are not
determined.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).” A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should

accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   “ACCESSORY USE.” A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   “AH ZONE.” An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one

and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare. This includes areas downstream from dams.
   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. Critical facilities include, but are not

      (3)   Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to
a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas,
as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of
the current.
      (4)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding.
   “FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).” A map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards
and the regulatory floodway.
   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).” A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency

ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, hi any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   “FLOODPROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, the FEMA form in effect at the time of certification
stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation with walls
that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all structural
components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces,
including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact forces.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.
Also referred to as the “regulatory floodway”.
   “FLOODWAY FRINGE.” That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in § 152.50, means that the variance
granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining
this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every newly
constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of
the community for fifty to one hundred years. Structures that are permitted to
be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those
years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the
property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may
incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.” A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or

shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “GOVERNING BODY.” The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.” The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect hi any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district.
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in

either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).”
      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage means under the standard
flood insurance policy the cost to repair a substantially flood damaged
building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a
substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage
prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are floodproofing
(nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination
thereof.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   “LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC’s include the following
categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was inadvertently included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA
amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   Letter of Map Revision - based on fill (LOMR-F). A determination
that a structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill
above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.

constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   “LEVEE SYSTEM.” A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   “LIMITED STORAGE.” An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.

attached garage, deck support, basement entryway or grade immediately next to
the structure and after the completion of construction.
   “LOWEST FLOOR.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure’s lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   “MANUFACTURED HOME.” A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or
without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required
utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar
transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. The term

   (A)   Civil offense: If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain development permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation: If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this ordinance including obtaining or complying with the terms
and conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved
modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain
Administrator shall issue a notice to the person responsible for the violation
and/or the property owner, stating the facts of the offense or violation, the
section of this chapter and/or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how
the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into conformity with
this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what period of time the
remedy is to occur, which period of time shall be reasonable and shall be
determined by the nature of the violation and whether or not it creates a
nuisance or hazard. The remedy may include an order to stop work on the
development. The notice shall also state that a citation may be forthcoming in
the event that the requested remedies and corrective actions are not taken,
which citation will request a civil monetary fine and shall state the maximum
fine which could be imposed. See below.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 152.25 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Council of Bellevue hereby appoints the Zoning Administrator to
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting
or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein
referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)
§ 152.26 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
152.06. Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of floodplain
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §
152.36(B)(2) and (D)(2);
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to Mean Sea Level. In AE, Al-30, AH, and A
zones where the community has adopted a regulatory Base Flood Elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)

         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner;
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, “adversely
affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
152.06, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§

public inspection and make available as needed the following:
         (a)   Certification required by §
152.36 (lowest floor elevations) as shown on an accurately completed and
certified Elevation Certificate, verify and record the actual elevation (in
relation to Mean Sea Level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
and substantially improved structures, in accordance with §
152.26(A)(2);
         (b)   Certification required by §
152.36(B) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown on
an accurately completed and certified FEMA floodprooofing certificate. Verify
and record the actual elevation (in relation to Mean Sea Level) to which the
new and substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed, in
accordance with §
152.26(B);
         (c)   Certification required by §
152.36(C) (elevated structures);
         (d)   Certification of elevation required by §
152.39(A) (subdivision standards);
         (e)   Certification required by §
152.36(E) (floodway encroachments);

exact location of die boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
152.50(C)(2);
         (b)   When base flood elevation data and floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
152.06, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonable
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
152.35 through
152.40;

(Am. Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)
§ 152.36 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
152.06, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall
be provided in accordance with standards of § 152.36(C).
      (1)   In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified
in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest
adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than one (1) foot
above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative
Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the
technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base
Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot cross
sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
cabinet if necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations.
      (3)   (a)   In all other zones, elevated one (1) foot above the base
flood elevation.
         (b)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the
lowest floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building
inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and
verification shah be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with § 152.36(A) or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed to an elevation one (1) foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification along with
the design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in §
152.36(D).
      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an
elevation one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walk by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this requirement
must meet or exceed the standards of §
152.36(D).
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
         (a)   On individual lots or parcels;
         (b)   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (c)   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
         (d)   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (e)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
         (f)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood;
      (2)   All such manufactured homes must be:
         (a)   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and
         (b)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1) foot above
the level of the base flood elevation; and
         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (3)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (4)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured

         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Flood ways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established
in §
152.06, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
152.35 through
152.40.
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)
§ 152.37 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 152.06, where
streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base
flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
152.06.
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)
§ 152.38 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the
elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and

   (G)   Must not be modified for a different use after permitting.
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)
§ 152.40 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation at the
site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)
§ 152.41 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.06, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall: have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one (1) foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in § 152.36(B).
(Ord. 2012-06-01, passed 7-11-12)
APPEALS
§ 152.50 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. City Council of Bellevue
shall establish a Variance and Appeal Board consisting of the City Board of
Adjustments.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Variance and Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Variance and Appeal
Board may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky
Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Variance
and Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
existing or proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent use;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain, management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to me property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Variance and Appeal Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under “public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
      (5)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §
152.50 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Bellevue City Clerk and shall be recorded in
a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and
report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. “Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

§ 153.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council finds that buildings and neighborhoods having
historic, architectural, or cultural interest and value have been neglected,
altered, or destroyed notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of
preserving and continuing the use of such buildings and neighborhoods and
without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss to the public.
   (B)   The Council finds that the historic character of the city is of vital
importance in maintaining the economy of the city and that its historic
buildings and neighborhoods can be preserved, improved, and used by means of
appropriate changes.
   (C)   The Council finds that the city has well-established residential and
business districts and that the history of the city is shown today through
buildings representing the activities and events during its growth. The Council
finds that the city has buildings and areas that represent the persons who live
and work or have lived and worked in the city during a period of more than 100
years. It is the finding of the City Council that the distinctive and
significant character of this city can only be maintained by protecting and
enhancing its historic, architectural, and cultural heritage and by preventing
unnecessary injury or destruction of its landmarks and historic districts which
are civic and community assets.
   (D)   The Council finds that the federal and state governments have passed
laws to protect and preserve landmarks and historic districts, that some of
these laws provide incentives for historic preservation, and that the National
Historic Preservation Act was amended in 1980 to establish a certified local
government program creating a new federal-state-local partnership to encourage
the efforts by cities to protect and preserve their landmarks and historic
districts.
   (E)   The Council finds that individual historic preservation projects have
already been undertaken in the city and that this chapter will encourage
additional preservation work that will be important in achieving the goals of
the city.
   (F)   The Council finds that this chapter will benefit all the residents of
the city and all the owners of property.
   (G)   The City Council declares as a matter of public policy that the
preservation, protection, and use of landmarks and historic districts is a
public necessity because they have a special character or a special historic,
architectural, or cultural interest and value and thus serve as visible
reminders of the history and heritage of this city, state, and nation. The
Council declares as a matter of public policy that this chapter is required in
the interest of the health, prosperity, safety, welfare, and economic well-
being of the people.
   (H)   The purpose of this chapter is to effect the goals as set forth in the
above findings and declarations of public policy and specifically, but not

listing the property on the National Register. The Mayor, the Commission, or
the property owner may appeal the final decision by the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
(Ord. 87-12-1, passed 12-28-87)
§ 153.06 DESIGNATION OF LANDMARK OR HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   (A)   The City Council may request the Commission to study a building or an
area in order to make a recommendation on whether it qualifies for designation
as a landmark and landmark site, or historic district. The owner of a property
may request the Commission to study his building in order to make a
recommendation on whether it qualifies for designation as a landmark and
landmark site. Each designation of a landmark shall include the designation of
a landmark site.
   (B)   The Commission shall assemble information about a property or district
being considered for designation and shall schedule a public hearing on the
proposed designation. Prior to the hearing, the Chairman or another member of
the Commission may have an individual meeting with an owner or a tenant of a
building under consideration for designation as a landmark or as a part of a
historic district. The purpose of this meeting shall be to explain the
provisions of this chapter and to answer questions about how a designation
would affect the owner or tenant. Prior to the hearing, the Commission may hold
an educational meeting in an area or a neighborhood under consideration in
order to explain the provisions of this chapter and to answer questions.
   (C)   Advertised notice of the public hearing shall be given, including
conspicuous posting on the property or in the proposed district, for fourteen
(14) consecutive days immediately prior to the hearing. Notice of the hearing
shall be given at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the hearing by
certified letters to the owners of property under consideration and the owners
of all adjoining property. Written notice shall be considered sufficient when
it is mailed to the person listed in the records maintained by the Property
Valuation Administrator.
   (D)   Before its first public hearing on a designation, the Commission shall
recommend to City Council and gain approval for general guidelines that will
apply to the city’s landmarks and historic districts and will assist owners in
the preservation and rehabilitation of their property. The general guidelines
shall include the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and may include other
guidelines that will apply to all designated property in the city. In its
guidelines and in its decisions, the Commission shall not limit new
construction to any one architectural style but shall seek to preserve the
character and integrity of the landmark or the historic district. The
Commission may expand or amend the guidelines provided it holds a public
hearing on the changes and submits the proposed changes to the City Council for
approval.
   (E)   A landmark or historic district shall qualify for designation when it
meets one or more of the following criteria which shall be discussed in a
Commission report making its recommendations to the City Council:
      (1)   Its value as a reminder of the cultural or archaeological heritage
of the city, state, or nation;
      (2)   Its location as a site of a significant local, state, or national
event;
      (3)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the city, state, or nation;
      (4)   Its identification as the work of a master builder, designer, or
architect whose individual work has influenced the development of the city,
state, or nation;
      (5)   Its value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that retains sufficient elements showing its architectural
significance;
      (6)   Its distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style
valuable for the study of a period, method of construction, or use of
indigenous materials;
      (7)   Its character as a geographically definable area possessing a
significant concentration of buildings or structures united by past events or
by its plan or physical development; or
      (8)   Its character as an established and geographically definable
residential neighborhood or business district, united by culture, architectural
style, or physical plan and development.
   (F)   After evaluating the testimony at its public hearing, and the survey
information and other material it has assembled, the Commission shall make its
recommendation to the City Council with a written report on the property or
area under consideration. In its report the Commission may set goals for a
proposed historic district in order to encourage appropriate work in the
district.
   (G)   The City Planning and Zoning Commission shall report on the
relationship between the proposed designation and existing and future plans of
the development of the city. If the Planning and Zoning Commission approves of
the proposed designation, it shall amend the comprehensive plan to include the
proposed designation and shall recommend a change in the zoning map to show the
proposed historic designation. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward
its comments, the comprehensive plan amendment, and the zoning map change to
the City Council. If the Planning and Zoning Commission does not approve of the
proposed designation, it shall forward its comments to the City Council.
   (H)   The City Council shall approve, modify, or disapprove the proposed
designation within 60 days after receiving the recommendation of the Historic
Preservation Commission and the material from the Planning and Zoning
Commission. If the City Council decides to make a designation and no
comprehensive plan amendment has been adopted and no zoning map change has been
recommended, the City Council shall request the Planning and Zoning Commission
to reconsider its earlier decisions and shall provide that the designation
shall take effect after these preliminary steps have been approved.
   (I)   The Commission shall notify each owner of the decision relating to his
property and shall arrange that the designation of a property as a landmark or
as a part of a historic district be recorded in the land records of the county.
The Commission shall also give notice of the decision to the government offices
in the city and county which shall retain them for future reference.
   (J)   The amendment or rescission of any designation shall be accomplished
through the same steps as were followed in the original designation.
(Ord. 87-12-1, passed 12-28-87)
§ 153.07 MAKING CHANGE TO LANDMARK OR PROPERTY IN HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   (A)   A certificate of appropriateness from the Historic Preservation
Commission shall be required before a person may undertake the following
actions affecting a landmark, landmark site, or property in a historic
district:
      (1)   Alteration of the exterior part of a structure that is visible to
the public;
      (2)   New construction;
      (3)   Demolition; or
      (4)   Relocation.
   When seeking a building permit involving designated property, the person
must submit a certificate of appropriateness approving the work listed in this
division (A).
   (B)   When a person wishes to undertake an exterior alteration visible to
the public affecting a landmark, landmark site, or property in a historic
district or when a person wishes to undertake new construction, demolition, or
relocation affecting a landmark, landmark site, or property in a historic
district, that person shall apply to the Commission for a certificate of
appropriateness. This application is required even when the proposed work does
not require a building permit. The applicant shall provide, where applicable,
drawings of the proposed work; photographs of the existing building, structure,
or site and adjacent properties; and information about the building materials
to be used.
   (C)   In the event work is being performed without the required certificate
of appropriateness, the city shall issue a stop work order. All work shall
cease on the designated property. No additional work shall be undertaken as
long as such stop work order shall continue in effect. The Commission shall
meet with the owner or tenant to resolve the problem. The city may apply in
circuit court for an injunction to enforce its stop work order.
   (D)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing on each certificate of
appropriateness within 30 days after a completed application is received by the
Commission. The Commission shall make a decision on the application within 45
days after the receipt of a completed application, provided the Commission may
extend the time for decision an additional 60 days when the application is for
demolition or new construction. The Commission shall approve or disapprove each
application, and it shall give its reasons for its decision using the criteria
contained in this section and in its guidelines. The Commission may suggest
modifications to an application and may then approve a certificate of
appropriateness providing for revisions in the plans submitted. If the
Commission fails to decide on an application within the specified time period,
the application shall be deemed approved. Applicants shall be given notice of
the public hearings and meetings relating to their application and shall be
informed of the Commission’s decision. When an application has been approved,
the applicant shall be given a certificate of appropriateness. Advertised
notice of the public hearing shall be given, including conspicuous posting on
the property.
   (E)   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall use its
guidelines. The Commission shall consider the effect of the proposed work on
the landmark, landmark site, or property in the historic district upon which
such work is to be done; and the relationship between such work and other
buildings and structures on the landmark site or other property in the historic
district. In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the Commission shall
consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style,
design, texture, materials, and color. The certificate from the Commission
shall not relieve the property owner from complying with the requirements of
other state and local laws and regulations.
   (F)   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall be aware
of the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the applicant.
The Commission shall also recognize the importance of approving plans that will
be reasonable for the applicant to carry out. Before an applicant prepares his
plans, he may bring a tentative proposal to the Commission for its comments.
The Commission shall prepare a list of routine alterations that shall receive
immediate approval without a public hearing when an applicant complies with the
specifications of the Commission. The list shall include paint colors
appropriate for different types of buildings.
   (G)   Owners and tenants shall apply to the Commission for a certificate of
appropriateness for a sign before their sign is made. In addition to its
guidelines, the Commission shall prepare and distribute examples of signs that
would be appropriate in a historic district. The Commission’s standards for
signs shall be the standards used in a historic district regardless of any
conflicting provisions of other local laws and regulations.
   (H)   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark, building, or
structure on a landmark site, or a building or structure in a historic
district, the Commission shall negotiate with the applicant to see if an
alternative to demolition can be found. The Commission may ask interested
individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to
demolition and in obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs for the
threatened building. After its public hearing, the Commission may decide that a
building or structure in a historic district or on a landmark site may be
demolished because it does not contribute to the historic district or to the
landmark. On all other demolition applications, the Commission shall study the
question of economic hardship for the applicant and shall determine whether the
landmark or the property in the historic district can be put to reasonable
beneficial use without the approval of the demolition application. In the case
of an income-producing building, the Commission shall also determine whether
the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from his building. The Commission
may ask applicants for additional information to be used in making these
determinations. If economic hardship or the lack of a reasonable return is not
proved, the Commission shall deny the demolition application unless the
Commission finds grounds to grant the demolition application under the points
contained in division (E) above.
   (I)   When an applicant wishes to move a landmark, building, or structure on
a landmark site, or a building or structure in a historic district, or when an
applicant wishes to move a building or structure to a landmark site or to a
property in a historic district, the Commission shall consider the contribution
the building or structure makes to its present setting; whether there are
definite plans for the site to be vacated; whether the building or structure
can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; and the
compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed site and adjacent
properties. These considerations shall be in addition to the points contained
in division (E) above.
   (J)   The applicant shall have the right to appeal to the Circuit Court from
a decision of the Commission on an application for a certificate of
appropriateness.
   (K)   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall
conform to the provisions of such certificate. It shall be the responsibility
of the Building Inspector and the Commission to inspect from time to time any
work being performed to assure such compliance. In the event work is being
performed which is not in accordance with such certificate, the city shall
issue a stop work order. All work shall cease on the designated property. No
additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall
continue in effect. The Commission shall meet with the owner or tenant to
resolve the problem. The city may apply in circuit court for an injunction to
enforce its stop work order.
(Ord. 87-12-1, passed 12-28-87)
§ 153.08 MAINTENANCE OR REPAIR OF LANDMARK OR PROPERTY IN HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   (A)   Every person in charge of a landmark, landmark site, or property in a
historic district shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of
such buildings or structures; and all interior portions thereof which, if not
so maintained, may cause such buildings or structures to deteriorate or to
become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair. The purpose of
this section is to prevent a person from forcing the demolition of his building
by neglecting it and by permitting damage to the building because of weather or
vandalism. No provision in this chapter shall be interpreted to require an
owner or tenant to undertake an alteration or to restore his building to its
original appearance.
   (B)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a landmark, landmark site,
or property in a historic district does not change the exterior appearance that
is visible to the public.
   (C)   An owner shall immediately notify the city of emergency conditions
dangerous to life, health, or property affecting a landmark, landmark site, or
property in a historic district, and the owner shall immediately start and
complete the work required to make his property safe. In any case where the
city determines that there are emergency conditions dangerous to life, health,
or property affecting a landmark, landmark site, or property in a historic
district, the city shall order the remedying of these conditions without the
approval of the Commission. The city shall promptly notify the Chairman of the
Commission of the action being taken.
   (D)   The Commission shall request a meeting with the property owner when
his landmark or building in a historic district is in poor repair, and the
Commission shall discuss with the owner ways to improve the condition of his
property.
   (E)   The provisions of this section shall be in addition to all other
provisions of the Kentucky Building Code and/or the BOCA National Existing
Structures Code, Second Edition, 1987, requiring buildings and structures to be
kept in good repair.
(Ord. 87-12-1, passed 12-28-87)

Chapter 35.

notice to the holder and upon a hearing as hereinafter provided.

fails to comply with the applicable laws or any other provision set forth
herein, indicating the specific reasons for such failure, including copies of
applicable inspection reports or noncompliance notices sent to the owner which
have not been remedied. The suspension notice shall be delivered to the tenant
of each rental unit and shall also be conspicuously posted on the rental unit.

§ 160.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined as
follows:
   “FAIR HOUSING LAWS.” The Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FFIA)
and the provisions of KRS 344.600 et seq., as may be amended from time to time
(fair housing laws).
   “GROUP HOME.” A residential facility for the care of seven (7) or less
unrelated individuals living in a single housekeeping unit and recognized as
handicapped individuals under the Fair Housing Act and Americans with
Disabilities Act. A sober living facility shall be considered as a group home
for all purposes consistent herewith.
   “HANDICAPPED.” Person with disabilities. For the purpose herein, has the
meaning set forth in the federal Fair Housing Act and the Americans with
Disabilities Act and is an individual who has a physical or mental impairment
that limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual, is
regarding as having such impairment, or has a record of such impairment. While
a person recovering from substance abuse is considered a person with a
disability under 42 U.S.C. § 3602(h), a person who is currently engaged in
illegal use of a controlled substance is not.
   “OPERATOR.” An individual or business entity, whether for profit or non-
profit, which provides residential services at a group home.
   “REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.” The act of making a dwelling unit or housing
facility(ies) readily accessible to and usable by a person with disabilities,
through the removal of constraints in the city's land use, zoning, permit and
processing procedures. All accommodations may not be reasonable, and the
reasonableness of a request will be determined by the city.
   “SOBER LIVING FACILITY.” A single family dwelling unit used by individuals
recovering from a drug and/or alcohol addiction, considered as a handicapped
individual under state or federal law. A sober living facility shall not
provide on-site supportive services to residents, including the following:
mental health services; clinical rehabilitation services; social services;
medical, dental, nutritional or other health care services; financial
management services; legal services; vocational services; and other similar
supportive services.
(Ord. 2022-03-02, passed 4-13-22)
§ 160.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Fair housing laws impose an affirmative duty on local governments to
make reasonable accommodation in their land use and zoning regulations and
practices when such accommodation may be necessary to afford handicapped
individuals an equal opportunity to housing in accordance therewith.
   (B)   In furtherance of the purposes of the fair housing laws, this chapter
is intended to: preserve the residential character of single family residential
neighborhoods; ensure that group homes, including sober living facilities, are
actually entitled to reasonable accommodation; limit the secondary impacts of
group homes including sober living facilities by reducing noise and traffic;
preserve safety and provide adequate on-street parking; provide an
accommodation for handicapped individuals that is reasonable and actually bears
some resemblance to the opportunities afforded non-handicapped individuals to
use and enjoy a dwelling in a residential neighborhood; and, to provide a
living environment that will enhance the opportunity for the handicapped to be
successful in their programs. Pursuant to fair housing laws, this chapter is
also created to provide handicapped individuals reasonable accommodation in
rules, policies, practices, and procedures to ensure equal access to housing
and facilitate the development of housing for individuals with such recognized
handicaps when the same may act as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.
   (C)   There is hereby established a procedure for making requests for
reasonable accommodation in land use and zoning regulations, policies,
practices, and procedures to comply fully with the intent and purpose of fair
housing laws. Unless a group home has been granted reasonable accommodation as
provided in this chapter, group homes shall comply with zoning regulations,
