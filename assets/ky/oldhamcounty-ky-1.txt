connection with the enforcement of the ordinance.
      (2)   The lien shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk. The

significant adverse impacts on the health, safety and welfare of the citizens
of the county, the potential impacts of these pollutants and pollution may
include:
      (1)   Adverse impacts to public health and safety, drinking water
supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other
land and water uses;
      (2)   Changing natural ecosystems through the destruction of habitat, and
the loss of plant and animal life;
      (3)   Posing significant health risks through an increase in bacteria and
toxic materials;

elements of a stormwater pollution prevention plan and require any business to
adopt and implement a plan as may be reasonably necessary to fulfill the
purposes of this chapter. The Enforcement Official may establish the
requirements of BMPs for any premises.
         (b)   The notice and order may be given, provided that if in the
opinion of the county or its designated representative, the unlawful condition
is such that it is of imminent danger or peril to the public, then the county
or its designated representative may, with or without notice, proceed to abate
the same, and the cost thereof shall be charged against the property. The
county, as described further in this subchapter, may recover the cost of the
actions from the property owner.

time specified or within a reasonable time, the county may take the corrective
action and the cost of the corrective action shall be the responsibility of the
owner and/or the developer. The cost of the abatement and restoration shall be
borne by the owner of the property and the cost shall be invoiced to the owner
of the property. If the invoice is not paid within 90 days, the Enforcement
Official shall have the authority to place a lien upon and against the
property. If the lien is not satisfied within 90 days, the Enforcement Official
is authorized to take all legal measures available to enforce the lien as a
judgment, including, without limitation, enforcing the lien in an action

§ 52.64 EMERGENCY ORDERS AND ABATEMENT.
   The Enforcement Official may order the abatement of any discharge from any
source to the stormwater conveyance system when, in the opinion of the
Enforcement Official, the discharge causes or threatens to cause a condition
that presents an imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare of the
environment or a violation of a KPDES permit. In emergency situations where the
property owner or other responsible party is unavailable and time constraints
are such that service of a notice and order to abate cannot be effected without
presenting an immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare of the
environment or a violation of a KPDES permit, the county may perform or cause
to be performed that work as shall be necessary to abate the threat or danger.
The costs of any abatement shall be borne by the owner and shall be collectable
in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 04-830-217, passed 12-21-2004)
§ 52.99 PENALTY.

for every subsequent but separate offense made by the same person. The penalty
shall be in addition to other enforcement actions of this section.
      (2)   The penalty may be assessed for each day, beyond schedules applied
in compliance orders or other schedules issued to the property owner or other
person responsible, for unauthorized activity defined in this chapter.
      (3)   In determining the amount of the penalty a penalty schedule may be
developed that shall consider the following:
         (a)   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to
the public health or to the public or private property resulting from the
violation;
         (b)   The duration and gravity of the violation;
         (c)   The effect on ground or surface water quality;

         (e)   The amount of money saved by noncompliance;
         (f)   Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally;
         (g)   The cumulative effect of other enforcement actions applied for
the same offense;
         (h)   The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to
comply with the stormwater quality management program; and
         (i)   The costs of enforcement to the county.
      (4)   The maximum civil penalties will be determined by the type of
offense. This indicates the maximum that may be imposed for a first offense and
does not reflect the increases described above for repeat offenses.
         (a)   Development without or inconsistent with permit; up to $5,000.
To engage in any development, use, construction, remodeling or other activity
of any nature in any way without all required permits inconsistent with any
approved plan, permit, certificate or other form of authorization granted for
the activity;
         (b)   Violation by act or omission; up to $5,000. To violate, by act
or omission, any term, variance, modification, condition or qualification

activity upon land or improvements thereon;
         (c)   Illicit discharge; up to $5,000. Any person who is found to have
improperly disposed of any substance defined as an illicit discharge, not an
allowable discharge or causes the county to be in noncompliance with any
applicable environmental permit; and
         (d)   Household products; up to $500. Any person who is found to have
improperly disposed of any substance not included in §
52.41 that was purchased over-the-counter for household use, in quantities
considered normal for household purposes, which upon discharge to the MS4 or
drainage network would have an adverse impact on water quality or cause the
county to be in noncompliance with any applicable environmental permit.
      (5)   In the event there are penalties assessed by the state against the
county caused by any person, the person shall be assessed the equivalent amount
of civil penalty. This shall include but is not limited to penalties for
improper disposal or illegal dumping or illicit connection into the MS4.
   (B)   Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement
processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to public
health, safety, welfare and environment and is declared and deemed a nuisance,
and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief as provided by state
and local law.
   (C)   Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this chapter are not
exclusive of any remedies available under any applicable federal, state or
local law and the county may seek cumulative remedies.

deemed guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and shall, upon citation to court and
subsequent conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed $500 or be
imprisoned for a period not to exceed 12 months, or both so fined and
imprisoned. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

Unrestrained animals not claimed within five days of their impoundment or of
notice to their owner, and not placed in suitable new homes after such time,
may be humanely euthanized by the agency. However, if an impounded animal has
an injury or physical condition, or aggression, which causes the animal to
suffer or endangers the kennel, then the ACO or its agent may immediately
euthanize the animal.
   (C)   Every owner reclaiming an impounded animal which is subject to the
terms of this subchapter shall pay a fee per the fines and fee schedule of the
County Animal Control.

Animal Shelter for the remainder of its quarantine period. The owner of the
animal shall be responsible for the quarantine fee per the fines and fees
schedule of the County Animal Control. An owner who is unavailable or incapable

§ 95.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he or she will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter “person
aggrieved”) may file a complaint with the chief executive officer. Complaints
shall be in writing and shall contain that information and be in a form as the
chief executive officer requires. Upon receipt of a complaint, the chief
executive officer shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or person who
allegedly committed or about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing
practice. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or within 30 days after
the expiration of any period of reference under division (C) below, the chief
executive officer shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to
the person aggrieved whether he or she intends to resolve it. If the chief
executive officer decides to resolve the complaints, he or she shall proceed to
try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by
informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion. Nothing said or
done in the course of these informal endeavors may be made public or used a
evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter without the written
consent of the persons concerned.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) above shall be filed within 180 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be
in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complain
against him or her and with the leave of the chief executive officer, which
shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend
his or her answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the chief executive
officer, the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance with this chapter, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days
thereafter, files a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The chief executive officer will assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance within 30 days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30
days hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this chapter, insofar as those rights relate to the subject of the
complaint. If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has
occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from
engaging in the practice or order affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
chief executive officer shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain
voluntary compliance.

§ 95.11 INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENAS GIVING OF EVIDENCE.
   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the chief executive officer shall have
access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and
other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy
those materials and take and record the testimony or statements of those
persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation;
provided, however, that the chief executive officer first complies with the
provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and
seizures. The chief executive officer may issue subpoenas to compel his or her
access to or the production of those materials, or the appearance of those
persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and
subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or
interrogatories were issued or served in aid of civil action in the United
States District Court for the district in which the investigation is taking
place. The chief executive officer may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the chief executive officer, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the name of the chief executive officer to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued by the chief executive officer himself or
herself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their
face the name and address of the respondent and shall state that they were
issued at his or her request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the chief executive officer shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in United States District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the
person may petition the chief executive officer to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The chief executive officer shall grant the petition if he or she
finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable
time or place, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the
evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other
good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the chief
executive officer, or other person at whose request it was issued, may petition
for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which
the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts
business.
   (F)   The county attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the chief
executive officer participates as a part of as amicus pursuant to this chapter.

§ 95.12 ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS.
   The rights granted by §§
95.03,
95.04,
95.05 and
95.06 may be enforced by civil actions in state or local courts of general
jurisdiction. A civil action shall be commenced within 180 days after the
alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that the
court shall continue the civil case brought pursuant to this section of §
95.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the chief executive officer are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice
complained or in the complaint made to the chief executive officer and which
practice forms the basis for the action in court; And provided, however, that
any sale, encumbrance or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court
order issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fide
purchaser, encumbrancer or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the
filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter
shall not be affected.

§ 110.047 REVIEW OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Applicants for whom a food sales requirement exists shall provide
periodic information demonstrating compliance with the continuing percentage
requirement earned from the sale of food.
   (B)   This documentation shall be provided quarterly for the applicant’s
first year, semiannually for the second year, and annually thereafter, provided
that the applicant stays in compliance, and shall be submitted with the
applicant’s quarterly regulatory fee filings. This information shall consist of
a certificate from a certified public accountant familiar with the applicant’s
pertinent business records.
   (C)   This certificate shall state:
      “I have conducted a limited scope audit according to accepted accounting
principles of the pertinent records of (company), License Number             
under Ordinance No.                     ,
      I hereby certify that the licensee earned the minimum food sales
requirement stipulated in License Number                 for the quarter ending
               .
               (MINIMUM FOOD SALES REQUIREMENT IS 50%)
      The licensee derived                % of its gross sales from food and
               % of its gross receipts from the sale of alcohol.”
   (D)   This certificate shall include a brief description of the methodology
utilized in the determination of the certified percentage.
   (E)   In the event the food requirement is not met during any particular
quarter, the County ABC Administrator shall have discretion in determining
whether revocation is appropriate, or whether the licensee may be allowed a
reasonable period of time to reach compliance.
   (F)   If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee, the County ABC
Administrator may apply an accounting period of at least one year in
determining whether or not the minimum food requirement has been met.
(Ord. KOC 16-410-181, passed 5-17-2016)
§ 110.048 REGULATORY LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   Pursuant to KRS 243.075, there is hereby imposed a license fee and a
regulatory fee on the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of each
license issued by the ABC Administrator.
      (1)   The license fee and regulatory fee shall be set by resolution of
the County Fiscal Court, and shall be available from the County ABC
Administrator.
      (2)   The regulatory fee shall be established to generate revenue that
does not exceed the total of the reasonable expenses actually incurred by the
county in the previous fiscal year for the cost of administration of this
chapter, substance abuse education and additional policing.
      (3)   Should the Fiscal Court fail to address the regulatory fee in any
year, then the fee shall remain at the level at which it was last fixed.
   (B)   Payment of the regulatory fee shall be remitted to the County ABC
Administrator, who shall transmit fees upon collection to the County Treasurer,
to be held in a separate account maintained for the purpose of fully
reimbursing the county for the estimated cost of regulatory and administrative
fees, substance abuse education, and any additional policing related to the
sale of alcoholic beverages in the county.
   (C)   The regulatory license fee shall be in addition to any other taxes,
fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a quarterly credit of 25%
against the annual regulatory license fee in the county shall be allowed.
Payment of the regulatory license fee shall accompany the tax return approved
for that use by the county. The return and payment are due no later than by the
end of the month immediately following each calendar quarter (July 1 to
September 30; October 1 to December 31; January 1 to March 31; April 1 to June
30).
   (D)   Failure to pay the quarterly remittance within ten days of the due
date constitutes a violation and subjects the licensee to suspension or
revocation. A civil action maybe filed by the county to collect the unpaid fee,
penalties and interest. If such a civil action is filed, the licensee shall be
responsible for the expense of attorney fees and the costs associated with
prosecuting the civil action.

§ 110.049 CHANGE OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   Since licenses issued by the county may be in the name of a
corporation, it is necessary that stock ownership changes in the corporation be
reported to the County ABC Administrator. The County ABC Administrator can
therefore investigate the person to whom the stock is transferred in order to
ascertain whether that person is precluded by statute from holding an interest
in an alcoholic beverage license.
   (B)   As used herein, the word CHANGE is construed to include any change in
directors or officers of the corporation, or change in ownership of stock
whereby any person secures 10% of the outstanding stock. Transfer of more than
10% of the total stock shall require a new license.
   (C)   The following information will be required concerning any new
director, officer or person securing any interest in an alcoholic beverage
license:
      (1)   Name and address;
      (2)   Nature of interest;
      (3)   Whether or not the applicant is a citizen of the United States;
      (4)   Date of birth and Social Security Number;
      (5)   Date residence was established in the state, if a resident of the
state. If a county resident, indicate when residence was established;
      (6)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license or
corporation or partnership holding a license under this act;
      (7)   Extent of stock ownership; and
      (8)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or
corporation or partnership holding a license in any other state or province.
(Ord. KOC 16-410-181, passed 5-17-2016)
§ 110.050 DORMANCY.
   (A)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conducts the business
authorized by a license or else the license will be declared dormant and become
null and void after 90 days. This is the intent of this section. Realizing that
a licensee, like other business, might have his or her business interrupted by
situations not under his or her control, various exceptions to the dormancy
rule have been included in this section.
   (B)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of
90 days shall become null and void. At the expiration of the 90-day period, the
license shall be surrendered to the County ABC Administrator.
   (C)   Except that the provisions of division (A) above shall not apply to
any licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a
license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, county or other governmental
agency under the power of eminent domain, whether the acquisition is voluntary
or involuntary, or loss of a lease through failure of the landlord to renew the
existing lease. The licensee shall furnish to the County ABC Administrator a
verified statement setting forth the fact that the licensee is unable to
continue in business prior to the expiration of the 90 days of inactivity, for
any of the reasons set forth herein, and the County ABC Administrator may grant
an extension of the dormancy, with the license continuing to remain in effect
during the license period or until same is transferred to another premises,
notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted during the period;
provided, however, no license shall be considered valid unless business is
conducted thereunder within 12 months from the date of notice to the County ABC
Administrator. The extension may not extend beyond the renewal date, but may be
for those times as the County ABC Administrator deems appropriate.
   (D)   All renewal licenses must be on file with the County ABC Administrator
within 30 days prior to the expiration of the licenses for the preceding
license period or the same shall be cancelled, except where the licensee is
unable to continue in business at the same premises licensed during the
preceding license period due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death,
the acquisition or threatened acquisition of these premises by any federal,
state, county or other governmental agency or private corporation possessing
power of eminent domain, whether the acquisition is voluntary or involuntary,
or loss of a lease through failure of the landlord to renew existing lease;
that the licensee shall file a written verified statement no less than 20 days
from the expiration date of the license, setting forth these facts, and the
County ABC Administrator is hereby authorized to extend the time for the filing
of a renewal of the license for a reasonable length of time within the sound
discretion of the County ABC Administrator; provided, however, the licensee
shall pay a license fee from the expiration date of the former license or
licenses. The license fee shall not be payable until application is made for
the transfer of the license to a new location.

license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and the place
proposed for business shall apply with all applicable building codes.
   (B)   A license will not be issued by the County ABC Administrator unless
there exists at least 100 feet between the front door of a licensee and the
front door of a school, church, daycare, or nursery. The County ABC
Administrator has the authority to waive this distance requirement.

or renewed to sell upon any premises or property, owned and occupied by the
licensee upon which there are delinquent taxes or fees due to any public agency
in the county.
   (B)   Further, if a licensee becomes delinquent in the payment of any taxes,
liens or any other obligation to any county public agency at any time during
the license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be
subject to revocation or suspension.

§ 111.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public
health, safety and general welfare by regulating peddling, itinerant traders,
traveling salespeople and other door-to-door salespersons, generally known as
peddlers. These persons typically market magazines, appliances, housewares and
other goods and services by going door to door in neighborhoods. The citizens
of the county are subject to unregulated peddling by sometimes questionable
organizations or individuals, with illegitimate products, or no intent to
deliver. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate peddling in the county,
to protect the public health, safety and welfare. To achieve this end, this
chapter requires peddlers seek licenses, have background checks and peddle
under certain limitations. However, it is not the intent of this chapter to
require legitimate sales representatives, visiting business or persons they
have already made appointments with, or already have a legitimate business
relationship with, to need licensing. Neither is it the intent of this chapter
to infringe free speech rights or require licensing for persons going door-to-
door for political campaigns, religious proselytizing or other free speech
reasons.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 151.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the state has in KRS Chapter 100 delegated to local
government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
County Fiscal Court hereby adopts the following floodplain management chapter.
(Ord. KOC 06-360-411, passed 9-5-2006; Ord. KOC 21-360-201, passed 3-16-2021)
§ 151.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood
damage.

   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve those uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.

DEFINITIONS
§ 151.015 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage, and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination
of both. In A ZONES, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are
usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base
flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   A1-30 AND AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   A99 ZONE. The part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the
parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   ADVERSELY AFFECTS. The cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) Flood depths are
shown.

year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s FIRM
where the base flood depths range from one to three feet, there is no clearly
defined channel, the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and
velocity flow may be evident. This flooding is characterized by ponding or
sheet flow.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD). BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the FIRM for Zones AE,
AH, A1–30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1–A30, AR/AH and AR/AO that indicates the water
surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1% or greater chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) that is habitable and not used solely for parking of vehicles,
structure access or storage in an area.

floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated or qualified community
official) from available technical studies, historical information and other
available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by
floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the FIA to provide
incentives to those communities in the regular program to go beyond the minimum
floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures for protection
from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or

of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See MUDSLIDES.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which FEMA or FIA has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the

   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by floodwaters from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a licensed professional
engineer or registered architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time
of certification stating that a nonresidential structure, together with
attendant utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §§
151.085 through
151.092, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the County Fiscal
Court will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100
years. (Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.)
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components and the like.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL CLASSIFICATION of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that meets one of the following:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary of
the Interior to qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). 
      (1)   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE COVERAGE provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively
damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, floodproof,
demolish or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC COVERAGE is available on residential and nonresidential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KRS 151.250; PLANS FOR DAMS, LEVEES AND THE LIKE TO BE APPROVED AND PERMIT
ISSUED BY CABINET (ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC PROTECTION CABINET).
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems or similar bodies, shall
commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of any
dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except those
constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or in
the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for the work
have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for the
construction, reconstruction or improvement and the plans and specifications
have been approved in writing by the Cabinet and a permit issued. However, the
Cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments or other obstructions
which are not of a size or type as to require approval by the Cabinet in the
interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the state
shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that the filling, raising or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for the work have been
submitted to and approved by the Cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this definition is intended to give the Cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where the obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
Cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.
   KRS 151.320; OFFICERS REQUIRED TO ENFORCE LAW.
      (1)   The Mayor or chief executive officer of each city and the County
Judge-Executive of each county shall have the concurrent duty of enforcing with
the Cabinet, within their respective cities and counties, the provisions of KRS
151.250, 151.280 and 151.310 and rules and regulations issued thereunder.
      (2)   When a violation of KRS 151.250, 151.280 or 151.310 within this
jurisdiction is brought to the attention of a Mayor or chief executive officer
of a city or a County Judge-Executive, he or she shall immediately notify the
Cabinet of the location and details of the violation.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to

include the following categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA
amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a SFHA.

that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations and planimetric features.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION-FILL (LOMR-F). A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   LEVEE. A human-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM.
      (1)   A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
      (2)   For a LEVEE SYSTEM to be recognized, the following criteria must be
met:
         (a)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised);
and
         (b)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or
state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a
community participating in the NFIP.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. This area must be of flood-resistant material, void of
utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature-controlled.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support or
basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of
construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or
landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure’s foundation
system.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The LOWEST FLOOR of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided that the enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built
on a permanent chassis and designed to be used, with or without a permanent
foundation, when connected or attached to the required utilities. The term also
includes park trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable structures
placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved
property. The term MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.
(See RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.)

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP. The flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) or the flood insurance rate map
(FIRM) for a community issued by FEMA.
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter
suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.
(The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or
adjusted assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL). The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the national flood insurance program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on a community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American vertical datum (NAVD) 1988. All development permit applications shall
indicate which data set is being used.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of
disaster response and recovery.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW). Describes a condition where there is a river, flow
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the MUDFLOW, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works and floodplain management regulations.

of unconsolidated material where the history, geology and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRMs. Refer to
FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of the county’s floodplain management
regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to those structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the county’s adopted floodplain management ordinances.
   NONRESIDENTIAL. Structures that are not designed for human habitation,
including, but is not limited to, small business concerns, churches, schools,
farm structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses,
recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial
structures, warehouses and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less
than six months duration.
   NORMAL HIGH WATER LEVEL. A mark delineating the highest water level of a
body of water which has been maintained for a sufficient period of time to
leave evidence upon the landscape. The NORMAL HIGH WATER ELEVATION is commonly
that point where the natural vegetation and landscape changes from
predominantly aquatic to predominantly terrestrial.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD). As corrected in 1988, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRMs and digitally referenced FIRMs
(DFIRMs). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD).  (See BASE FLOOD.) The flood that
has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any
flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the 100-YEAR FLOOD. Over
the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26% chance of experiencing such a flood
with the SFHA.
   PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY. A community that voluntarily elects to participate
in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that

violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the local
floodplain management regulations. During periods of probation, each insurance
policy is subject to a $50 surcharge.
   PROGRAM DEFICIENCY. A defect in a community’s floodplain management
regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation
of those floodplain management standards or of the standards of 44 C.F.R. parts
60.3, 60.4, 60.5 and/or 60.6.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to safety or health
of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons,
or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of
any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;

adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in
feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent
grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by FEMA,
the lowest floor shall be elevated two feet above the base flood elevation, as
determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will determine the
method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods include, but are
not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing
data available from other sources, use of historical data, and by the best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states, as a part of the
technical requirements for a state floodplain permit, the applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby base
flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to MSL and shall have
vertical error tolerances of no more than plus five-tenths foot. Cross-section
elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in
slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain
change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain, and
shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the Cabinet. If
necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the Cabinet
may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend
beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary
calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, the lowest floor shall be elevated two feet
above the base flood elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the
elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a
licensed professional engineer or licensed surveyor, and verified by the
community building inspection department to be property elevated. This
certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or nonresidential structure
(including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) above, or, together with attendant

hydrodynamie loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than
two feet above the level of the base flood elevation;
      (4)   A licensed professional engineer or registered architect shall
certify that the standards of this division are satisfied. The certification
shall be provided to the official as set forth in §
151.051(B)(3);
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) below;
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood-resistant materials below an
elevation two feet above the base flood elevation, and shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a licensed professional engineer or registered
architect; or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater without the need for human intervention.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts or pilings that include a fully enclosed
area formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood
elevation, shall be designed to preclude finished living space, and designed to
allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls without the need for human
intervention.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a licensed engineer or registered architect or meet the following
minimum criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions without the need for human intervention.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator);
      (3)   The interior portion of the enclosed areas shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms;
      (4)   The total floor area of all enclosed areas shall not exceed 300
square feet; and
      (5)   For enclosures greater that seven feet in interior height, where
elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest adjacent grade, a copy
of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the conversion of the area
below the lowest floor to a use or dimension contrary to the structure’s
originally approved design, shall be presented as a condition of issue of the
final certificate of occupancy.

and insured in accordance with the state motor vehicle regulations, is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Property located within areas of special flood hazard
established in §
151.031 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a licensed professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; and
      (2)   If this division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
151.065 through
151.071.
   (F)   Standards for utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems

greater than a two to one ratio unless a stability analysis is provided by a
licensed professional engineer;
      (3)   The top of the fill shall be no lower than two feet above the base
flood elevation. However, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a licensed
structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the structure
from damage due to erosion, scour and other hydrodynamic forces;
      (4)   The placement of the fill shall not adversely affect the flow or
surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties;
      (5)   All new structures built on fill must be constructed on properly
designed and compacted fill (to 98% of the standard proctor per ASTM D-698 or
equivalent) that extends beyond the building walls before dropping below the
base flood elevation and has appropriate protection from erosion and scour. The
design of the fill or the fill standard must be approved by a licensed
professional engineer; or
      (6)   Soil testing and compaction requirements set forth by the Standard,
Uniform or National Building Codes or the International Residential and
Building Codes are required.

§ 151.067 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.031, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a licensed
professional engineer is provided, demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with §
151.031.

151.031 are areas designated as shallow flooding areas.
   (B)   These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of
one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water
path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions apply.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation, or in Zone AO, the flood depth specified
on the FIRM above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is
specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than
two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall meet the following:
         (a)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation, or in Zone AO, the flood depth specified on
the FIRM above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is
specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than
two feet above the highest adjacent grade; and
         (b)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall
be completely floodproofed either above or to the base flood elevation in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that
any space below that level is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water, and with structural components having the capability
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as stated in §

such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available
(Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is
the lesser, shall be provided.
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and the lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood
elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a licensed professional engineer or licensed surveyor and provided
to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (F)   All streets shall be constructed at or above the 1% annual chance
flood (100-year flood elevation).

§ 151.071 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   (A)   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain).
Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the
floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of the
base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be
taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
   (B)   Critical facilities shall be constructed on properly compacted fill
and have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least one foot above

APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 151.085 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this subchapter are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duly of the County Fiscal Court to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare.
The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be
met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this subchapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions
that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are
designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a
variance are more appropriate.

§ 151.086 DESIGNATION OF VARIANCE AND APPEAL BOARD.
   The County Fiscal Court shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of the
County Board of Adjustments.

§ 151.087 DUTIES OF VARIANCE AND APPEAL BOARD.
   (A)   The County Board of Adjustments shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   (B)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the County Board of
Adjustments or any taxpayer may appeal the decision to the County Circuit
Court, as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.

§ 151.088 APPEALS/VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   In passing upon the applications, the County Board of Adjustments shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following:
   (A)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
   (B)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   (C)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage, and the effect of the damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
   (D)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed
facility;
   (E)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of
a functionally dependent facility;
   (F)   Availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or
erosion damage;
   (G)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
   (H)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
   (I)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   (J)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
   (K)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets and bridges.

§ 151.089 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the County Board of Adjustments may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
   (B)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood hazard.
MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the County Board of Adjustments need not
grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever
elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the County
Board of Adjustments believes will both provide relief and preserve the
integrity of the local ordinance.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard. In the
instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be made that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic
character and design of the structure.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
151.015 under PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in §
151.015 under FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION) or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
   (F)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built, and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (G)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to FEMA and the FIA upon request.
   (H)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use, provided that the provisions of §
151.088(A) through (E) are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood, and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not
create a public nuisance.

§ 151.090 VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.
   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be issued a written notice
in the form of a certificate of land use restriction that:
   (A)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
   (B)   Construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and
property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the County Clerk’s office, and shall be recorded in a manner
so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report the variances
issued in the community’s biennial report submission to FEMA.

§ 151.091 HISTORIC STRUCTURES.
   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (see definition in §
151.015) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure, and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
(Ord. KOC 06-360-411, passed 9-5-2006; Ord. KOC 21-360-201, passed 3-16-2021)
§ 151.092 NO IMPACT CERTIFICATION WITH THE FLOODWAY.
   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

§ 151.999 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no less than $500 or imprisoned for not more than 60 days, or both, and
in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day a
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing contained
herein shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking any other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

whether a bond release is warranted. The county's written report shall include
a recommended action regarding the bond release. When the county's written
report contains a recommendation for a bond release, the county will seek
approval from the Oldham County Fiscal Court. Upon said approval, the county
will then send out a bond release letter within ten working days.
      (3)   Upon receiving the bond release letter, the permittee shall be
released from all further obligations under this chapter, with the exception
that the application of best management practices shall continue after bond
release until all construction has ceased.

(Ord. 16-830-348, passed 8-16-2016)
§ 154.03 SCOPE OF COVERAGE.
   (A)   Applicability. This chapter shall apply to any new or redevelopment of
land disturbance activities over one acre or more and for projects that disturb
less than one acre if they are part of a larger common plan of development that
disturbs one acre or more. This chapter shall apply to private and public
development, including roads. This chapter shall not apply to any developments,
sections of developments or redevelopments approved prior to the date of the
passage of this chapter.
   (B)   Any development activity that involves land disturbance of one acre or
more shall submit to the County Engineer, prior to development, a stormwater
management plan showing location of post-construction best management practices
(BMPs) prior to any construction activity. This would include but may not be
limited to proposed major subdivision and commercial development.
   (C)   A stormwater management plan is not required for the following
activities:
      (1)   Any emergency activity that is immediately necessary for the
protection of life, property, or natural resources.
      (2)   Agricultural or silvicultual operations according to an
agricultural water quality plan approved by the county soil conservation
district or approved as required in the Kentucky Agricultural Water Quality
Plan developed in accordance with the Kentucky Agricultural Water Quality
Authority.
   (D)   Each stormwater management plan shall bear the name, telephone
information, electronic contact information, and address of the owner/developer
of the site and design engineer. It must also adhere to § 153.10. The plan must
be sealed and signed by a licensed professional engineer in the State of
Kentucky and submitted to the County Engineer.
   (E)   Any proposed development activity covered by this chapter shall also
obtain a soil and erosion control permit that includes a fee as established by
a fee schedule adopted by the county. There are no additional fees stipulated
for this chapter.
(Ord. 16-830-348, passed 8-16-2016)
§ 154.04 REVIEW OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   The County Engineer shall review each stormwater management plan and
determine its conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Acceptance
indicates that minimum requirements or intent are met and does not imply a
guarantee of performance. Based on this review, the county will either accept
the plan, accept with revisions or reject the plan indicating the reason and
procedure for submitting a revised plan.
   (B)   The county's review of the stormwater management plan is for general
compliance with this chapter. The design engineer is ultimately responsible for
the details of design, and the developer, property owner or his or her
assignees is responsible for implementation.
(Ord. 16-830-348, passed 8-16-2016)
§ 154.05 DESIGN CRITERIA AND METHODS.
   (A)   Design storms. The selection of a design storm is the basis for all
runoff calculations and facility design for a project site. The stormwater
conveyance system shall be designed to adequately handle the runoff from storms
having various frequencies of occurrence from different types of development in
accordance with the general categories set forth below in this section. To
ensure the adequacy of the stormwater conveyance system, the following minimum
design storms shall be used, where applicable:
      (1)   The ten-year storm shall be used for all public storm sewer inlets
and closed pipe systems. The ten-year storm shall also be used for all channels
and ditches, which should be capable of conveying the ten-year storm flow
within their banks.
      (2)   The 100-year storm shall be used as a check storm for storm sewer
systems designed for a ten-year storm to confirm containment at levels below
the rim opening to prevent surcharging.
      (3)   The two-year storm, ten-year storm, and 100-year storm shall be
used to calculate pre-development runoff from a site for detention, retention,
and sediment control basins.
      (4)   The two-year storm, ten-year storm, and 100-year storm shall be
used to calculate post-development runoff from a site for detention, retention
and sediment control basins.
      (5)   The 100-year storm shall be used for all detention, retention, or
sediment control basins as a check storm to ensure against flooding or
surcharging.
      (6)   The post-development peak flow rates shall be less than or equal to
the pre-development peak flow rates for the two-year storm, ten-year storm, and
100-year storm events.
   (B)   Runoff calculation methods.
      (1)   The Rational Method, the Modified Rational Method and the Soil
Conservation Service (SCS) Method are all acceptable. The calculations can be
made either by hand or with computer software. The design engineer should
choose the method that best fits the known values available and the size of the
development.
      (2)   The rainfall intensity should be obtained from Rainfall Intensity-
Duration-Frequency (IDF) Curves for the appropriate design storm. Since IDF
Curves have not been specifically developed for Oldham County, then the IDF
Curves developed for Metro Louisville shall be used and may be found in the
Louisville Metropolitan Sewer District Design Manual or obtained from the
Oldham County Engineer's office.
   (C)   Water quality treatment standard.
      (1)   The on-site water quality treatment standard is intended to improve
the water quality of stormwater runoff before being discharged into the MS4.
The standard is established so that stormwater management measures shall be
sized to capture the stormwater runoff volume from the 80th percentile
precipitation event, equivalent to a rainfall event of 0.6 inches, at a
minimum. This volume is sometimes referred to as "the first flush".
      (2)   The on-site water quality treatment standard is a volume-based
standard and is appropriate for sizing green infrastructure BMPs that provide
their primary treatment function by storing and treating the water quality
volume (WQv). Stormwater management measures, also known as structural best
management practices (BMPs) or green infrastructure BMPs, are designed to treat
a volume of runoff, which is detained for a certain period of time to allow for
settling of solids and associated pollutants, as well as any biochemical
treatment processes that may be provided for dissolved pollutants such as
adsorption, precipitation, biodegradation, and plant uptake.
      (3)   The WQv used for sizing green infrastructure BMPs shall be computed
as follows:
                  Rv = 0.009 (I) + 0.05
            where:
            Rv = volumetric runoff coefficient; and
            I = the percent imperviousness of the drainage area.
                  WQv= 3,630 xRvxPx A
            where:
            WQv = water quality volume (ft3)
            Rv = volumetric runoff coefficient;
            P = rainfall depth associated with the 80th percentile
precipitation event (in), equivalent to a rainfall event of 0.6 inches; and
            A = drainage area to BMP (acres).
      (4)   Green infrastructure BMPs should be selected, sized, and designed
to completely capture the WQv prior to discharging from the site. The green
infrastructure BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough
to treat the stormwater and release it at a rate that minimizes degradation of
the water resources, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance conditions. The
drain time for all green infrastructure BMPs shall be 48 hours at a maximum,
such that there is no standing or residual water in the BMP following the WQv
rainfall event.
(Ord. 16-830-348, passed 8-16-2016)
§ 154.06 DESIGN OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT MEASURES OR GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE BMPS.
   (A)   Stormwater management measures, also known as structural BMPs or green
infrastructure BMPs, shall be used to treat, filter, infiltrate, screen, evapo-
transpire, harvest or reuse stormwater runoff, or otherwise manage the
stormwater runoff quality. Common examples are basins that over detain,
infiltration basin or channels, rain gardens, bio-swales, dry wells, sand
filters, underground storage and water quality units.
   (B)   As set forth in § 154.05(C) above, calculations shall be required to
indicate that green infrastructure BMPs have been sized to completely capture
the WQv, equivalent to the runoff volume generated from a rainfall event of 0.6
inches.
   (C)   For additional information on the various types of green
infrastructure BMPs available to meet the water quality treatment standard
requirement, reference can be made to the Green Infrastructure Design Manual
developed by the Louisville Metropolitan Sewer District. Post construction
green infrastructure manuals have also been produced by many other communities
including Northern Kentucky SD1, the City of Radcliff, Shelby County and
Bowling Green, Kentucky.
(Ord. 16-830-348, passed 8-16-2016)
§ 154.07 SUBMISSION OF BOND.
   (A)   Construction of a stormwater management plan cannot began until the
owner has posted a stormwater and erosion control surety in accordance with §
153.15. Reduction and release of this bond shall follow the steps also given in
§
153.15. The stormwater and erosion control bond will be released once all
stormwater facilities and all requirements set forth in
Chapter 153 of this code are complete and operational.
   (B)   There are no additional sureties required in this chapter.
Furthermore, no sureties are required under the stormwater management
facilities agreement for long term management associated with this chapter.
(Ord. 16-830-348, passed 8-16-2016)
§ 154.08 ENFORCEMENT DURING CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Whenever the county finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
has failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the county may order
compliance by sending a written notice of violation to the developer, property
owner or their assignees. All violations shall be corrected within the time
period specified in the notice. The notice of violation shall be either mailed
to the property owner, or by personally serving the property owner with a
written notice of violation. If the violation is not corrected as specified or
if the county believes that the violation is grievous enough, the county may,
without limitation:
      (1)   Order the stoppage of work that is determined to have created, or
to have contributed to, any dangerous conditions. Only corrective work can be
performed under a stop work order.
      (2)   Issue a citation with an order to appear before the county Code
Enforcement Board.
      (3)   Call the surety that was posted for the site and initiate
corrective action by work forces under control of the county, with the cost of
such work being recoverable from the surety.
   (B)   Penalties. The county may commence appropriate legal action and/or
seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, seizure of bonds or placing
of liens, against any person who fails to abate a violation and/or to restore
an affected property prior to the deadline established in the notice of
violation. Any person who violates, neglects, omits, or refuses to comply with
any provision of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than
$75 per day nor more than $150 per day for each offense. The time of violation
shall be measured from the time written notice to correct is given to the
owner. Each day a violation is maintained shall constitute a separate offense.
Any recoverable cost of corrective action shall be in addition to fines imposed
as a penalty. The imposition of any penalty shall not exempt the violator from
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Stop work order/revocation of building permit. In the event that any
person holding a building permit violates the terms of this chapter, or
implements site development in such a manner as to materially adversely affect
the health, welfare, or safety of the public near the development site or
vicinity so as to be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious
to property or improvements in the vicinity, the county may issue a stop work
order in place of a notice of violation or may suspend or revoke any requited
building permit issued by the county.
(Ord. 16-830-348, passed 8-16-2016)
§ 154.09 OWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES OF STORMWATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   Operation and stormwater maintenance agreements. 
      (1)   The owner shall perform or cause to be performed preventative
maintenance of all stormwater management facilities during and after
construction to ensure proper functioning.
      (2)   All stormwater facilities shall be covered by a stormwater
management facilities maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as
designed. This agreement shall include any and all drainage easements required
to access and inspect the stormwater facilities. In addition, a legally binding
and enforceable covenant specifying the party(ies) responsible for the proper
maintenance of all stormwater facilities subject to the agreement shall be
secured prior to the release of the soil and erosion control bond. This
agreement shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the
stormwater facilities. It must be recorded with the County Clerk. Requirements
of this agreement will be made part of the binding elements of any new major
residential subdivision and also recorded on the record plat of the
subdivision. The maintenance agreement shall run with the property and be
binding upon the developer and its successors and assigns, including any
homeowner associations. This agreement may not be amended or abrogated in part
or whole, without the express written consent of the county.
   (B)   Stormwater maintenance easements.
      (1)   Maintenance easements rights are included within a drainage
easement. The county must be granted the authority to conduct inspections of
approved stormwater facilities on a routine basis, random basis, or based upon
a complaint or notice of violation. All easements granted for long term
maintenance shall be approved by the county and recorded in the office of the
County Clerk.
      (2)   All effort must be made to keep all stormwater management
facilities that benefit multiple property owners on property owned by a
corporation or group such as a homeowners association and not a private
individual.
   (C)   Maintenance and repair plan. Plan submittals for all stormwater
management facilities shall include a written procedure for the minimum
stormwater management facility maintenance requirements to ensure their
continual proper functioning. These plans and procedures shall identify all
parts and components of the facilities that require maintenance. This document
will become part of the stormwater management facilities agreement.
(Ord. 16-830-348, passed 8-16-2016)
§ 154.10 ENFORCEMENT POST CONSTRUCTION.
   Whenever the county finds, by inspection, that a person has violated a
prohibition or has failed to meet a requirement of this chapter or the
maintenance agreement, the county may order compliance by sending a written
notice of violation to the developer, property owner or their assignees,
including any homeowners association. All violations shall be corrected within
the time period specified in the notice. The notice of violation shall be
either mailed to the responsible party, or by personally serving the
responsible party with a written notice of violation. If the violation is not
corrected as specified or if the county believes that the violation is grievous
enough, the county may, without limitation perform the corrective action. The
cost and expenses of such corrective action shall be invoiced to the party
found in violation. If not paid within 30 calendar days, it will be collected
with any other taxes levied thereon for the year in which the work was
completed. The county may also place liens on the property. Appeal may be made
to the county Code Enforcement Board.

CHAPTER 158: GRANT ASSISTANCE FOR DRAINAGE REPAIRS
Section
   158.01   Grant program for homeowners whose property is being harmed by
stormwater runoff
§ 158.01 GRANT PROGRAM FOR HOMEOWNERS WHOSE PROPERTY IS BEING HARMED BY
STORMWATER RUNOFF.
   A matching grant program is established for certain residents of the county
who meet the following qualifications, and with the following restrictions:
   (A)   Financial assistance is in the form of a reimbursement grant to
qualifying homeowners in an amount not to exceed 50% of the cost of
construction or a maximum of $7,000 per homeowner, whichever is less, and not
more than the total current budgeted amount per year to all grant recipients.
   (B)   The program is intended for owner-occupied single-family dwellings and
duplexes.
   (C)   Assistance is limited to flooding caused by the overland flow of
stormwater. There will be no assistance to flooding caused by backup through
sanitary sewers or any other pipe system attached to the building. There will
be no assistance to prevent flooding caused by the seepage of ground water into
a residence, such as installation or replacement of a sump pump. Also, there
will be no assistance if any portion of the property is located within the
regulated floodplain of Oldham County.
   (D)   Assistance is limited to actual approved physical changes to the
dwelling or the surrounding property and the relocation of items such as air
conditioners, heat pumps, and the like that may be damaged by flood waters. The
installation, replacement, or rearrangement of sump pumps and ancillary devices
is excluded from this program.
   (E)   Improvements to the drainage for the homeowner must not harm adjoining
property owners and where possible must improve it.
   (F)   This program will be administered by the Oldham County Fiscal Court
and the Oldham County Engineer's Office. The County Engineer's Office will
review recommendations for improvements proposed by the property owner's
contractor and calculate the amount of financial assistance to be received by
the property owner, based on the estimated cost of the improvements and verify
that the homeowner qualifies for the program.
   (G)   The actual work to the property is based on estimated cost of the
improvements and must be completed by third party contractors or laborers. The
property owner is responsible for contacting them, obtaining bids, determining
that the work is completed correctly, and making all payments to them. No
improvements to properties under this program will be performed by the Oldham
County government. The Oldham County Fiscal Court will not provide supervision
or approval of work for either the property owner or the contractor. The
property owner must obtain all necessary permits and make certain of compliance
with all pertinent laws, codes, and regulations.
   (H)   The Oldham County Fiscal Court will require releases of liability and
assurance of payment from both the property owner and the owner's contractor.
Blank forms for these releases will be supplied by Oldham County, but it is the
responsibility of the property owner to acquire all signatures. If the forms
are not properly completed, Oldham County Fiscal Court will not participate in
the program.
