AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN REGARDING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS
§ 36.05 STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   The affirmative action policy of the city is to promote equal employment
opportunity; to prohibit discrimination in city employment on account of race,
color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or handicapped status not related
to performance of the job; and to bring about a fair representation and
utilization of females and minorities on all levels of city employment.
(Ord. 87-14, passed 6-15-87)
§ 36.06 DISSEMINATION OF POLICY.
   The city will advise all employees and applicants for employment of this
policy and will make known to the public that employment opportunities are
available on the basis of individual ability and will encourage all persons who
are employed by the city to strive for advancement on that basis.
(Ord. 87-14, passed 6-15-87)
§ 36.07 PERSONNEL ACTIONS.
   The city will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are
recruited and employed and that employees are treated during their employment,
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or
handicapped status not related to ability to perform the job; and such
affirmative action shall include all terms and conditions of employment such
as: hiring, placement, upgrading, demotion, transfer, layoff, and termination.
(Ord. 87-14, passed 6-15-87)
§ 36.08 WORKFORCE ANALYSIS.
   (A)   Survey of labor market. The city has determined that the labor market
in which it operates is Crittenden County, Kentucky. The latest reliable data
that shows the utilization of females and minorities by job category is the
general census.
   (B)   City workforce. The number of women and minorities employed by the
city in each job category was compared with those available in the workforce of
the community. The percentage of such employees in the community was multiplied
by the total city employees in each job category to determine the number
required for fair selection.
   (C)   Goals and timetables.
      (1)   The city examined each category in which the number of females and
minorities were fewer than the number required for fair selection. Appropriate
goals for women and for minorities were established to bring the city's
utilization to a level comparable to the community workforce. Timetables were
based on the anticipated annual job openings in each category.
      (2)   Where a disparity exists between the percentage of a protected
group in the community population and the percentage in the community
workforce, the goals are adjusted to overcome this disparity. The goal of fair
utilization of minorities and females in each category is to be met within the
next five years through the personnel procedures established by this plan
without discrimination of any kind. The maintenance of this policy will be
continuing effort.
(Ord. 87-14, passed 6-15-87)

responsible for implementation of this affirmative action plan and shall have
authority to require department heads to furnish such information as is
necessary to keep current forms and reports.
   (C)   Duties. The Administrator/Coordinator shall disseminate the city's
equal employment opportunity policy as set forth in the AAP; maintain current

§ 38.03 COMPETITIVE SEALED BIDDING.

bidding, except as otherwise provided by KRS 45A.370 to 45A.385 and for the
purchase of wholesale electric power by municipal utilities as provided in KRS
96.901(1).
   (B)   The invitation for bids shall state that the award shall be made on
the basis of the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated bid price. If the
latter is used, the objective measurable criteria to be utilized shall be set
forth in the invitation for bids.
   (C)   Adequate public notice may include posting on the Internet or

(Ord. 09-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 38.04 COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATION.
   (A)   The city may contract or purchase through competitive negotiation upon
a written finding that:
      (1)   Specifications cannot be made sufficiently specific to permit award
on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated bid price,
including, but not limited to, contracts for experimental or developmental
research work, or highly complex equipment which requires technical
discussions, and other nonstandard supplies, services, or construction; or
      (2)   Sealed bidding is inappropriate because the available sources of
supply are limited, the time and place of performance cannot be determined in
advance, the price is regulated by law, or a fixed price contract is not
applicable; or
      (3)   The bid prices received through sealed bidding are unresponsive or
unreasonable as to all or part of the requirements, or are identical or appear
to have been the result of collusion; provided each responsible bidder is
notified of the intention to negotiate and is given a reasonable opportunity to
negotiate, and the negotiated price is lower than the lowest rejected bid by
any responsible bidder.
   (B)   Proposals shall be solicited through public notice pursuant to KRS
45A.365(3) or any other means which can be demonstrated to notify an adequate
number of qualified sources to permit reasonable competition consistent with
the nature and requirement of the procurement. The request for proposals shall
indicate the factors to be considered in the evaluation and the relative
importance of each factor.
   (C)    Written or oral discussions shall be conducted with all responsible
offerors who submit proposals determined in writing to be reasonably
susceptible of being selected for award. Discussions shall not disclose any
information derived form proposals submitted by competing offerors. Discussions
need not be conducted:
      (1)   With respect to prices, where such prices are fixed by law or
regulation except that consideration shall be given to competitive terms and
conditions; or
      (2)   Where time of delivery or performance will not permit discussions;
or
      (3)   Where it can be clearly demonstrated and documented from the
existence of adequate competition or accurate prior cost experience with that
particular supply, service, or construction item that acceptance of an initial
offer without discussion would result in fair and reasonable prices and the
request for proposal notifies all offerors of the possibility that award may be
made on the basis of initial offers.
   (D)   If discussions pertaining to the revision of the specifications or
quantities are held with any potential offeror, all other potential offerors
shall be afforded an opportunity to take part in such discussions. A request
for proposals based on revised specifications or quantities shall be issued as
promptly as possible, shall provide for an expeditious response to the revised
requirements and shall be awarded upon the basis of the lowest bid price or
lowest evaluated bid price submitted by any responsive and responsible offeror.
No discussion shall be conducted with offerors after submission of revised
proposals except for a compelling reason as determined in writing by the city.
The request for proposals shall state that an award is to be made without
discussion except as herein provided.
   (E)   Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is
determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city based upon the
evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals.

§ 38.05 NEGOTIATIONS AFTER COMPETITIVE SEALED BIDDING WHEN ALL BIDS EXCEED
AVAILABLE FUNDS; ACTION WHEN NO BIDS RECEIVED.
   (A)   In the event that all bids submitted pursuant to competitive sealed
bidding under KRS 45A.365 result in bid prices in excess of the funds available
for the purchase, and the city determines in writing:
      (1)   That there are no additional funds then available from any source
so as to permit an award to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder; and
      (2)   The best interest of the city will not permit the delay attendant
to a resolicitation under revised specifications or revised quantities under
competitive sealed bidding as provided in KRS 45A.365; then a negotiated award
may be made as set forth in divisions (B) or (C).
   (B)   Where there is more than one bidder, competitive negotiations pursuant
to KRS 45A.370 shall be conducted with the three (two if there are only two)
bidders determined in writing by the city to be the lowest responsive and
responsible bidders to the competitive sealed bid invitation. Such competitive
negotiations shall be conducted under the following restrictions:
      (1)   If discussions pertaining to the revision of the specifications or
quantities are held with any potential offeror, all other potential offerors
shall be afforded an opportunity to take part in such discussions; and
      (2)   A request for proposals, based upon revised specifications or
quantities, shall be issued as promptly as possible, shall provide for an
expeditious response to the revised requirements, and shall be awarded upon the
basis of the lowest bid price or lowest evaluated bid price submitted by any
responsive and responsible offeror. No discussion shall be conducted with
offerors after submission of proposals except for a compelling reason as
determined in writing by the city. The request for proposals shall state that
award is to be made without discussions except as herein provided.
      (3) Where, after competitive sealed bidding, it is determined in writing
that there is only one responsive and responsible bidder, a noncompetitive
negotiated award may be made with such bidder in accordance with KRS 45A.380.
(Ord. 09-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 38.06 NONCOMPETITIVE NEGOTIATION.

further determined in writing by the City Administrator or his designee that:
   (A)   An emergency exists which will cause public harm as a result of the
delay in competitive procedures; or
   (B)   There is a single source within a reasonable geographical area of the
product or service to be procured; or
   (C)   The contract is for the services of a licensed professional, such as
attorney, physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, certified public accountant,
registered nurse, or educational specialist; a technician such as a plumber,
electrician, carpenter, or mechanic; or an artist such as a sculptor, aesthetic
painter, or musician, provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to
architects or engineers providing construction management services; or
   (D)   The contract is for the purchase of perishable items purchased on a
weekly or more frequent basis, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, fish or meat;
   (E)   The contract is for replacement parts where the need cannot be
reasonably anticipated and stockpiling is not feasible;

§ 38.09 DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITY; RIGHT OF NONDISCLOSURE.
   (A)   A written determination of responsibility of a bidder or offeror shall
be made, based on a reasonable inquiry conducted by the city. The unreasonable
failure of a bidder or offeror to promptly supply information upon request may
be grounds for a determination of non-responsibility of such bidder or offeror.
   (B)   A written determination of responsibility of a bidder or offeror shall
not be made until the bidder or offeror provides the city with a sworn
statement made under penalty of perjury that he has not knowingly violated any
provision of the campaign finance laws of the Commonwealth and that the award
of a contract to the bidder or offeror will not violate any provision of the
campaign finance laws of the Commonwealth. “KNOWINGLY” means, with respect to
conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, that a
person is aware or should have been aware that his conduct is of that nature or
that the circumstance exists.

or offeror pursuant to this section may not be disclosed outside of the city
without prior written consent of the bidder or offeror.
(Ord. 09-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 38.10 PREQUALIFICATION OF BIDDERS AND OFFERORS.
   (A)   Suppliers may be pre-qualified as responsible prospective contractors
for particular types of supplies, services, and construction.

contractor until the supplier provides the city with a sworn statement made
under penalty of perjury that he has not knowingly violated any provision of
the campaign finance laws of the Commonwealth.
   (C)   “KNOWINGLY” means, with respect to conduct or to a circumstance
described by a statute defining an offense, that a person is aware or should
have been aware that his conduct is of that nature or that the circumstance
exists.
   (D)   Solicitation mailing lists of potential contractors of such supplies,
services, and construction shall include, but shall not be limited to, such
pre-qualified prospective contractors. Pre-qualification shall not foreclose a
written determination:
      (1)   Between the time of bid opening or receipt of offers in the making
of an award that a pre-qualified prospective contractor is not responsible; or
      (2)   That a prospective contractor who is not pre-qualified at the time
of the bid opening or receipt of offers is responsible.

financing in the financing structure of an applicant's project.
(Ord. 87-27, passed 6-29-87)
§ 39.02 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.

establish loan conditions, and recommend disposition of loans under the

   (C)   The Mayor shall serve as Loan Fund Manager and will act as liaison
between potential borrowers and RLF Board of Directors. The Mayor may delegate
this authority or request assistance as needed.
   (D)   In addition, three members of the Board will serve as a Loan Review

goals and objectives cited in the RLF administration plan. Factors such as jobs
created, jobs retained, potential for future job creation, tax revenues
created, types of jobs created, minority and/or women's business assisted, and

BILLING AND PAYMENT
§ 50.25 CUSTOMER-DISPUTED BILLING.
   (A)   A utility customer may dispute the correctness of all or part of the
monthly billing charged for utility service, in accordance with the procedure
set forth in this section. The utility customer aggrieved by an error in the
monthly billing shall notify the Utility Billing Office within the time
permitted; otherwise, the right to dispute the billing shall be deemed waived.
A utility customer who has disputed all or part of a monthly billing, pursuant
to this section, shall not be entitled to dispute these amounts when carried
forward as a part of a subsequent billing.
   (B)   The procedure to resolve disputed billing charges shall be as follows.
      (1)   A customer aggrieved by a monthly billing shall notify the Utility
Billing Office in writing, within 14 calendar days from the date the billing
was issued. The notice shall state the portion of the billing amount which is
in dispute, and set forth the reasons the customer believes he is not obligated
to pay as billed.
      (2)   If the Utility Billing Office determines that the dispute is timely
filed, and is not an attempt to rechallenge amounts disputed under a previous
billing, a representative of the Utility Billing Department shall schedule an
informal meeting between the customer and the Utility Billing Manager. This
meeting shall be held within seven days from the receipt of the customer's
notice, and shall be scheduled at the convenience of the Utility Billing
Manager.
      (3)   The customer and the Utility Billing Manager shall review the
utility's records, the customer's allegations, and all other relevant materials
available to the Utility Billing Manager. The Utility Billing Manager shall
attempt to resolve the dispute in a manner satisfactory to the customer, and
shall have full authority to adjust disputed billings where appropriate. If an
agreement is reached, a written memorandum stating the terms of the agreement,
initialed by the parties, shall be recorded in the Utility Billing Office. If
an agreement is not reached, the Utility Billing Manager shall summarize his
decision resolving the dispute, and within five days after the meeting mail a
copy of his decision to the customer and the City Administrator.
      (4)   If the decision is unsatisfactory to the customer, the customer
shall within five days of receipt of the Utility Billing Manager's decision,
file with the Utility Billing Office a written request for a formal hearing
before the City Administrator. The customer shall be given notice of the time
and place of the hearing and advised to bring all information relevant to the
dispute. Hearings shall be scheduled twice monthly on a weekday closest to the
fifteenth and twenty-eighth of each month. Failure of the customer to timely
request a hearing shall render the decision of the Utility Billing Manager
final and binding on the customer and the utility.
      (5)   At the hearing, the utility and the customer shall be entitled to
present all evidence that is, in the City Administrator's view, relevant and
material to the dispute, and to examine and cross- examine witnesses. A written
record of the hearing shall be maintained.
      (6)   Based on the record established at the hearing, the City
Administrator, within five days of the completion of the hearing, shall issue
his written decision formally resolving the dispute. His decision shall be
final and binding on the utility and the customer.
   (C)   Until the date of the City Administrator's or the Utility Billing
Manager's decision, whichever is later, the utility shall not terminate the
customer's utility service, and shall not issue a notice of termination solely
for non-payment of the disputed amounts.
   (D)   Utilization of this dispute procedure shall not relieve the utility
customer of his obligation to timely and completely pay all other undisputed
utility billing charges or installments and surcharges, and the undisputed
portions of billings which are the subject of the present dispute. Failure by
the customer to timely and completely pay all such undisputed amounts shall
subject the customer to termination of utility service in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
§ 50.26 TERMINATION OF UTILITY SERVICE.
   (A)   When a utility customer has not timely challenged all or part of a
monthly billing, pursuant to §
50.25, and the customer has become 45 days delinquent in the payment of the
account, the Utility Billing Manager shall initiate the termination of utility
service by mailing to the customer a notice of termination.
   (B)   Where a utility customer has challenged a billing pursuant to §
50.25, and the matter has been finally resolved by either the City
Administrator or the Utility Billing Manager, the Utility Billing Manager
shall, within five days after the final decision is issued, mail to the
customer a notice of termination.
   (C)   The notice of termination shall contain the following information.
      (1)   The amount to be paid.
      (2)   The date the notice of termination was issued.
      (3)   The date on which a termination of utility service shall occur. The
date of termination shall be at least 15 calendar days after the date on which
the notice of termination was issued.
      (4)   A statement that, unless the Utility Billing Office receives full
payment of the amount shown on the notice of termination prior to the date of
termination, utility service will be terminated.
      (5)   A statement that, in lieu of paying the amount shown, an eligible
customer may, prior to the date of termination, file a written request for the
establishment of a deferred payment plan.
      (6)   The telephone number of the Utility Billing Office and the name of
a person to contact regarding the billing charge.
   (D)   If, prior to the date of termination, the utility has not received
complete payment of the amount shown on the notice of termination, and the
customer has not requested the establishment of a deferred payment plan, then
the Utility Billing Manager shall terminate utility service provided to the
customer on the date of termination.
   (E)   Offers, by customers, of partial payment, other than under a deferred
payment plan provided for in this chapter, shall be rejected. If the Utility
Billing Office received payment of the entire amount shown on the notice prior
to the date of termination, the payment shall be considered timely and shall
halt the termination process.
   (F)   The following limitations shall apply to use of the utility
termination procedure.
      (1)   Utility service shall be terminated between the hours of 8:30 a.m.
and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. No terminations shall be permitted on a

non-payment of amounts less than $20 but shall, on the 45th day of the
delinquency, institute proceedings in municipal court to collect the
delinquency.
§ 50.27 DEFERRED PAYMENT PLANS.
   (A)   A customer who temporarily becomes unable to timely and completely pay
a monthly bill charge when due may contact the Utility Billing Office and file
a written application for the establishment of a deferred payment plan to
enable the customer to pay the account and avoid termination of utility
service. The Utility Billing Manager shall review all applications to determine
if the customer is eligible for a deferred payment plan.
   (B)   The following classes of customers are ineligible to request deferred
payment plans.

defaulted in his obligation to make timely payments under a prior deferred
payment plan within one year of the customer's current request.
      (3)   A customer who is currently making installment and surcharge
payments under a prior deferred payment plan.
   (C)   When an application for a deferred payment plan is received from an
ineligible customer, the Utility Billing Office shall notify the customer of
the reason the customer is ineligible. The Utility Billing Office shall proceed
as if the customer had not made the request.
   (D)   An eligible customer, whose request is timely filed, shall be
scheduled for an appointment with a representative, shall discuss the matter
with the customer, and shall determine a suitable deferred payment plan. The
plan shall become effective on the signing of the agreement by the utility
representative and the customer, which shall be executed within five days after
its submission to the customer. A failure to execute a deferred payment
agreement within this time frame shall permit the utility to act as if it were
not submitted.
   (E)   No deferred payment plan shall be established which does not meet the
following minimum requirements.
      (1)   An initial payment of at least 25% of the outstanding balance
covered under the deferred payment plan, payable at the time of the customer's
written acceptance of the deferred payment agreement.

under the deferred payment account, payable at the time each installment is
due.
      (4)   An agreement between the customer and the utility, that the
customer's failure to make timely payments in accordance with the deferred
payment plan, shall subject the customer to summary termination of utility
service within 72 hours after the default under the plan, in lieu of the
procedure under §
50.26.
§ 50.28 SUMMARY TURN-OFF; TERMINATION.
   It is the policy of city utilities to notify customers prior to termination
of service. In certain circumstances, delivery of written notice may be
impossible or impractical when balanced against the need to protect the system
against waste of water, leaks, contamination, or other hazard.
   (A)   Grounds for summary turn-off without notice.
      (1)   The superintendent of the utility may direct the temporary turn-off
of service to one or more customers where the following conditions exist.
         (a)   Leaks, brakes, or failure in the mains, services, pumping
machinery, or other equipment require a partial or total discontinuance in
service.
         (b)   Instances where contaminates dangerous to health have entered
the water system, necessitating a total or partial discontinuance of service.
      (2)   In the event service is interrupted for one of these reasons the
superintendent shall provide affected customers with notice of the reason for
turn-off, and the expected duration of the interruption of service by the most
practical medium.
   (B)   Summary turn-off termination with notice.
      (1)   In certain circumstances enumerated below, the utility customer's
interest in continued service may be lost because of intentional or negligent
misconduct as defined in this section, which interferes with the maintenance,
orderly operation, or quality of product of the water utility. Notice must have
been given as provided in division 2.
         (a)   Tampering (other than by qualified personnel effectuating
repair) with any main, service line, tap, pipe, meter, curb box, valve, or any
other appurtenance connected with, or the property of the utility.
         (b)   Employing an unauthorized connection, cross- connection, or
interconnection with any main, service line, or other appurtenance connected
with, or owned by the water utility.
         (c)   On abandonment of a premises without notice by the customer,
service to the vacant property may be terminated where the superintendent of
the utility determines damage might result to the building or utility property.
         (d)   Failure to promptly repair leaky service lines, after being
notified by the utility in writing to do so. A notice to repair shall specify a
period for repair which shall not exceed 30 days.
         (e)   Failure to provide a reasonable and safe entrance to a service
premises for the purposes of reading, inspection, maintenance, and removal of a
meter, inspection of piping, or other inspection necessary to assure compliance
with these regulations, after having received two written requests from the
utility to provide access.
      (2)   Before service is terminated for any of the above reasons, a
utility representative shall deliver a written notice to the premises, and
attempt to inform an adult on the premises of the pending turn-off of service.
The notice shall state the reason for the turn- off, and the right to challenge
the turn-off before the City Administrator within three business days after
receipt of the turn-off notice. If no hearing is requested, or the City
Administrator determines the turn-off was justified; the service contract and
service to the premises shall be terminated.
      (3)   A duplicate copy of the notice shall be sent by certified mail to
the customer the following day. Hearings before the City Administrator shall be
informal, and the superintendent of the utility, and the customer, shall
present evidence which supports their positions. The customer shall be notified
by the City Administrator of his decision in writing, either at or after the
meeting. Termination of service shall be effectuated no sooner than 24 hours
after the City Administrator's decision.
§ 50.29 REINSTATEMENT OF UTILITY SERVICE.
   When a customer has been terminated for a default in payment, and the
customer has completely paid all arrearages due on the account, including fees
associated with the restoration of service, the Utility Billing Office shall
reinstate utility service to the customer as soon as it is practical. In the
event service is terminated under §
50.29, service shall not be reinstated until the grounds justifying the turn-
off have been eliminated by the customer, and all fees associated with the
restoration of service have been paid. The Utility Billing Office shall
reinstate utility service to the customer as soon as practical thereafter.
§ 50.30 REGULATIONS, PROHIBITIONS, AND CONDITIONS.
   The following regulations, prohibitions, and conditions shall be deemed to
supplement the Bond Ordinance and the Water and Sewer Rate Ordinance adopted by

      (7)   Nonpayment of bills.
   (C)   Any customer desiring to discontinue the water and/or sewer service to
his premises for any reason must give notice of discontinuance in writing at
the City Hall; otherwise, a customer shall remain liable for all water used and
water and/or sewer services rendered to such premises by the city unless said
notice is received by the city.
   (D)   Bills and notices relating to the conduct of the business of the city
will be mailed to the customer at the address listed on the application unless
a change of address has been filed in writing with the city; and the city shall
not otherwise be responsible for delivery of any bill or notice nor will the
customer be excused from the payment of any bill or any performance required in
said notice.
   (E)   (1)   Meters will be read monthly between the 15th and 20th of each

on the first day of each month.
      (3)   All bills not paid on or before the past due date shall be deemed
delinquent, and the city may serve a customer a written final notice of said
delinquency, and of the fact that such customer is entitled, upon written
request, to a hearing on the question of termination of service. If a
delinquent bill is not paid within ten days after the date of such final
notice, and if no hearing is requested, or if a hearing is requested and timely
held, and such customer's delinquency is thereby established, the water supply
to the customer may be discontinued without further notice; provided, however,
if, prior to discontinuance of service, there is delivered to the city, or to
its employee empowered to discontinue service, a written certificate signed by
a physician, a registered nurse, or a public health officer that, in the
opinion of the certifier, discontinuance of service will aggravate an existing
illness or infirmity on the affected premises, service shall not be
discontinued until the affected resident can make other living arrangements or
until ten days elapse from the time of the city's receipt of said
certification, whichever occurs first.
      (4)   If a deadline date falls on a Sunday or legal holiday, such
deadline shall not expire until the next succeeding secular day.
   (F)   Where the water supply to the customer has been discontinued for non-
payment of delinquent bills, a charge as may be specified or revised from time
to time in any applicable rate ordinance will be made for reconnection of water
service, but the reconnection will not be made until after all delinquent bills
and other charges, if any, owed by the customer to the city have been paid.
   (G)   The Manager shall have the right to require that a nominal sum, or
such other meter deposit as may be specified or revised from time to time in
any applicable rate ordinance, shall be placed on deposit with the city by a
customer for the purpose of establishing or maintaining such customer's credit
and/or as assurance for the payment of water and/or bills by such customer.
   (H)   All meters shall be installed, renewed, and maintained at the expense
of the city, and the city reserves the right to determine the size and type of
meter used.
   (I)   Upon written request of any customer, the meter serving said customer
shall be tested by the city. Such test will be made without charge to the
customer if the meter has not been tested within 60 months preceding the
requested test; otherwise, a charge of $25 will be made and then only if the
test indicates meter accuracy within the limits of 2%. If a meter is inaccurate
in excess of 2%, adjustments shall be made for the two preceding months prior
to test according to the inaccuracy in excess of 2%.
   (J)   Where a meter has ceased to register, or a meter reading cannot be
obtained, the quantity of water consumed will be based upon an average of the
prior six months' consumption, considering the conditions of water service
prevailing during the period in which the meter fails to register.
   (K)   The city shall make all reasonable efforts to eliminate interruption
of service, and, when such interruptions occur, will endeavor to re-establish
service with the shortest possible delay. When the service is interrupted, all
consumers affected by such interruption will be notified in advance whenever
possible.
   (L)   The city shall in no event be held responsible for any claim made
against it by reason of the breaking of any mains or service pipes, or by
reason of any other interruption of the supply of water caused by the failure
or breakage of machinery or stoppage for necessary repairs. No person shall be
entitled to damages nor for any portion of a payment refunded for any
interruption of service which in the opinion of the city may be deemed
necessary.
   (M)   Customers having boilers and/or pressure vessels receiving a supply of
water from the city must have a check valve on the water supply line and a
vacuum valve on the steam line to prevent collapse in case the water supply
from the city is discontinued or interrupted for any reason, with or without
notice.
   (N)   The premises receiving a supply of water and all service lines, meters
and fixtures, including any fixtures within said premises, shall at all
reasonable hours be subject to inspection by the duly authorized employees of
the city.

connections are conveniently located with respect to the city lines and mains.
The customer shall provide a place for metering which is unobstructed and
accessible at all times. The customer shall furnish and maintain a cutoff valve
on his side of the meter, and the city will furnish a like valve on its side of
the meter.
   (P)   The customer's service lines shall be installed and maintained by the
customer at his own expense in a safe and efficient manner and in accordance
with the city's rules and regulations and with the regulations of the
Department of Health.
   (Q)   If any loss or damage to the property of the city or any accident or
other injury to persons or property is caused by or results from the negligence
or wrongful action of the customer, a member of his household, his agent, or
his employee, the cost of the necessary repairs or replacements shall be paid
by the customer to the city, and any liability otherwise resulting shall be
that of the customer.
   (R)   Water furnished by the city may be used for domestic consumption by

   (S)   Each customer shall grant or convey, or shall cause to be granted or
conveyed, to the city, a perpetual easement and right-of-way across any
property owned or controlled by the customer whenever said easement or right-
of-way is necessary for the city water and/or sewer facilities and lines so as
to enable the city to furnish service to the customer.
   (T)   (1)   Water for building or construction purposes will be furnished by
meter measurement, only after suitable deposit has been made, the minimum
deposit being such amount as may be specified from time to time in any
applicable rate ordinance. The amount shall be determined by the city based
upon the size of the construction work contemplated, and all water for building
or construction purposes, as set forth in the permit, must pass through one and
the same meter.
      (2)   Water so supplied shall be discharged through a hose or pipe
directly upon the material to be made wet, or into a barrel or other container,
and in no case upon the ground or into or through a ditch or trench. All use of
water by any party other than the applicant, or use of water for any purpose or
upon any premises not so stated or described in the application, must be

city or community for public purposes such as fire extinguishment, public
parks, and the like.

APPENDIX A
WASTEWATER USER CHARGE SYSTEM
   (A)   The Wastewater User Charge System (UCS) strives to ensure an equal
distribution of collection and treatment costs to the wastewater users. All
customers with normal strength sewage, whether residential or commercial, will
receive the same minimum bill and will be charged the same cost per equal
volume of flow treated.
   (B)   The UCS will combine all costs to operate, maintain and repair the
wastewater transportation and treatment system. Fixed cost (debt service) will
also be included in the UCS.
      (1)   The wastewater user rate for Marion will be based on a percentage
of the water user rate, sufficient to cover the costs included in division (B)
above.
      (2)   The cost must be paid equally by each customer based on their
actual water use.
(Ord. 04-11, passed 6-21-04)
APPENDIX B
DEBT SERVICE
   (A)   The wastewater system improvements will be funded (in whole or in
part) by a loan from the SRF at an anticipated 1% interest rate and a 20-year
payback period. An administrative fee of .2% of the unpaid loan balance is
required.
 
Proposed loan                            $618,137
Interest                                 1%

Administrative fee (.002 of loan amount) $1,236
Existing annual bond debt                $69,557
Required total annual revenue            $379,927
 
   (B)   The debt service is considered a fixed cost, independent of the amount
of wastewater treated. The debt service for the SRF may need to be adjusted
when a final amortization schedule has been prepared.
   Annual sewer cost    =   $379,927   =   65.3%   =   75.1%

   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system inadequately treated into
receiving waters so as to cause violations of the city's KPDES permit or the
atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system;
      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system;
      (5)   To provide for the safety of the treatment plant employees; and
      (6)   To ensure that the municipality complies with its KPDES non-
discharge permit conditions, sludge permit conditions, including use and
disposal requirements and any other federal or state environmental laws to
which the municipal wastewater system is subject.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contribution to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits
to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements
for other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires
user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to the City of Marion, Kentucky and to
persons outside the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users
of the city publicly owned treatment works (POTW). Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Superintendent shall administer, implement, and enforce the

reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, copying records, records examination or in the performance of any of
their duties.
   (B)   The city, Approval Authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry onto their premises, the user shall make the necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, Approval Authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.

provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
   (C)   Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable
to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent that complies with
the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.

different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or "Go": Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop": Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed

Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary

shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing amber lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from

device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the
movement of traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or interferes with
the effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or
signal. No person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority
permit on any street, any traffic sign or signal bearing any commercial
advertising. Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting any

cause it to be removed.

particular section of this traffic code does not state that signs are required,
such section shall be effective without signs being placed to give notice
thereof.

control lights or signals or established regulations in order to facilitate the

governing the standing or parking of a vehicle, proof that the particular
vehicle described in the complaint was parked in violation of any such law or
regulation, together with proof that the defendant named in the complaint was
at the time of the violation the registered owner of the vehicle, shall

the vehicle was the person who committed the violation.

any place where the vehicle creates or constitutes a traffic hazard, blocks the
use of any fire hydrant, or obstructs or may obstruct the movement of any

other penalty is specifically provided shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and

motor vehicle or appliance, or obtain information as to the identity of a

pursuant to §§

§ 92.05 NOTICE TO ABATE; HEARING; APPEAL.
   (A)   Whenever the enforcement officer shall deem such a public nuisance to
exist, he shall issue a notice to the parties hereinafter stated, and such
notice shall:

      (2)   Specify the public nuisance and its location;
      (3)   Request the public nuisance to be abated; and
      (4)   Advise the party that he has ten days to abate the nuisance or to

to the last known address of the owner of the property whereon the nuisance is
located, as it appears on the current tax assessment roll. Where the owner of
the property is not the occupant thereof, such notice shall be mailed also to
the occupant. The enforcement officer shall coordinate his efforts to determine
ownership of a junked motor vehicle with the City Police Department, and notice
shall also be sent to the last registered and legal owner of record of the
junked motor vehicle, unless the owner is the owner or occupant of the premises
whereon the nuisance is located, and unless identification numbers are not
available to determine ownership of the vehicle. If the owner, or his address,
of any junked motor vehicle is not known or cannot be readily ascertained, the
notice to him to abate, and his right to a hearing may be given by attaching
such notice to the vehicle no less than ten days before action is to be taken.
If the latter method of service is used, the enforcement officer shall make an
affidavit attesting to such facts. Where a junked motor vehicle is found to be
upon any public property within the city, notice to the owner of the vehicle is
all that shall be required. Where a junked appliance is found on public
property, no notice shall be required.
   (C)   In the event a hearing is demanded, such hearing shall be held within
five days after the demand is made and shall be conducted by the enforcement
officer, who shall hear all the facts and testimony on the condition of the
junked motor vehicle or appliance, and the circumstances concerning the
location. Such hearing shall not be limited by technical rules of evidence. The
enforcement officer may impose such conditions and take such other action as he
deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purposes of §§
92.01 through
92.08. He may delay the time for removal of the junked motor vehicle or
appliance, if, in his opinion, circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of
any hearing, the enforcement officer may find that a junked motor vehicle has
been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public
property or that an appliance has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, is
inoperative, or displayed for sale on private or public property, and order the
same removed from the property as a public nuisance and order disposal of same.

junked motor vehicle and the correct identification number and state license
tag number of the junked motor vehicle, if available at the site.

officer by appealing to any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the
rules of civil procedure within 14 days after the decision. If no appeal is
taken within the time prescribed, or immediately after a final judicial review
affirming the right to remove the nuisance, the enforcement officer shall cause
the junked motor vehicle or appliance to be removed and disposed of in any
manner as he may provide.

   (B)   The cost of such removal and disposal shall be accounted for by the
enforcement officer, and where the full amount due the city for such service is

and in that case, the enforcement officer shall cause to be recorded in the
County Court Clerk’s office a sworn statement showing the cost and expense
incurred for the work, the date the work was done, and the location of the
property on which the work was done. The recordation of such sworn statement
shall constitute a lien and privilege on the property, and shall remain in full
force and effect for the amount due in principal and interest, plus cost of
court, if any, for collection, until final payment has been made. Sworn
statements recorded in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be prima
facie evidence that all legal formalities have been complied with and shall be
full notice to every person concerned that the amount of the statement, plus
interest, constitutes a charge against the property designated or described in
the statement and that the same is due and collectible as provided by law.

(Ord. 87-15, passed 6-15-87)
§ 96.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person
aggrieved") may file a complaint with the Chief Executive Officer. Complaints
shall be in writing and shall contain the information and be in the form the
Chief Executive Officer requires. Upon receipt of a complaint, the Chief
Executive Officer shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or persons who
allegedly committed or were about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing
practice. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or within 30 days after
the expiration of any period of reference under division (C) below, the Chief
Executive Officer shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to
the person aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it. If the Chief Executive
Officer decides to resolve the complaints, he shall proceed to try to eliminate
or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of
conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Nothing said or done in the course of
the informal endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent
proceeding under this chapter without the written consent of the persons
concerned.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) above shall be filed within 180 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be
in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint
against him and, with the leave of the Chief Executive Officer, which shall be
granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his answer
at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chief Executive Officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance with this chapter, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days
thereafter, file a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The Chief Executive Officer will assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the Chief Executive Officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance within 30 days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30
days thereafter, commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this chapter, insofar as the rights relate to the subject of the complaint.
If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in the
practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
Chief Executive Officer shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain
voluntary compliance.
(Ord. 87-15, passed 6-15-87)
§ 96.11 INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENA; GIVING OF EVIDENCE.
   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the Chief Executive Officer shall have
access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals,
and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and
copy such materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such
persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation,
provided, however, that the Chief Executive Officer first complies with the
provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and
seizures. The Chief Executive Officer may issue subpoenas to compel his access
to or the production of materials, or the appearance of persons, and may issue
interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same
limitations as would apply if the subpoenas for interrogatories were issued or
served in aid of a civil action in the United States district court for the
district in which the investigation is taking place. The Chief Executive
Officer may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the Chief Executive Officer, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the name of the Chief Executive Officer to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued by the Chief Executive Officer himself.
Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their face the
name and address of the respondent and shall state that they were issued at his
request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Chief Executive Officer shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in United States district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the
person may petition the Chief Executive Officer to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The Chief Executive Officer shall grant the petition if he finds that
the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or
place, that it requires a production of evidence which does not relate to any
matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly
onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Chief
Executive Officer or other person at whose request it was issued may petition
for its enforcement in the Municipal or State Court for the district in which
the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts
business.
   (F)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the Chief
Executive Officer participates as a part or as amicus pursuant to this chapter.

§ 96.12 ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS.
   (A)   The rights granted by §§
96.13 - 96.16 may be enforced by civil actions in state or local courts of
general jurisdiction. A civil action shall be commenced within 108 days after
the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred, provided, however, that
the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or §
96.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the Chief Executive Officer are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice
complained of in the complaint made to the Chief Executive Officer and which
practice forms the basis for the action in court, and provided, however, that
any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court
order issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fide
purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of
the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter
shall not be affected.
   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of
a prevailing plaintiff, provided that the plaintiff in the opinion of the court
is not financially able to assume the attorney’s fees.

   (G)   The City ABC administrator and his investigators shall have available
at all reasonable times for their inspection all books and records required to
be maintained by licensees under KRS 244.150 and the City ABC Administrator
shall receive copies of all reports submitted by licensee to the Department.
   (H)   The City ABC Administrator, before entering upon his or her duties,
shall take the oath as prescribed in Section 228 of the Constitution. The City
ABC Administrator and any employee delegated or assigned to the ABC
Administration may also be asked to execute a bond in such penal sum as the

§ 99.04 APPLICATION AND MAINTENANCE OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Advertisement. Before an application for a license shall be
considered, the applicant must publish a notice of its intent to apply for an
alcoholic beverage license in the newspaper used by the city for legal notices
under KRS 424.120. The notice shall include the following:
      (1)   The advertisement shall state the name and address of the applicant
and the name and address of each principal owner, partner, member, officer and
director if the applicant is a partnership, limited partnership, limited
liability company, corporation, governmental agency, or other business entity
recognized by law. All advertisements shall state the location of the proposed
premises for which the licenses sought, and the type of business, and type of
license for which application is made.
      (2)   The applicant shall attach to the application a newspaper clipping
of the advertisement.
   (B)   Form of application.
      (1)   All licenses granted under this chapter shall be approved by the
City ABC Administrator. Applications for the issuance of new licenses and for
renewals of existing licenses shall be in writing and upon the forms provided
by the Kentucky ABC Board and/or the city, both of which may be amended and
supplemented from time to time by each respective agency.
      (2)   The application shall be verified and shall set forth in detail
such information concerning the applicant and the premises for which the
license is sought, as required by the Kentucky Revised Statutes, the state
Department, and the city, including as follows:
         (a)   Name and address;
         (b)   Nature of interest;
         (c)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         (d)   Date of birth;
         (e)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of
Kentucky;
         (f)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license
or LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license under this chapter;
         (g)   Extent of stock or company ownership;
         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or LLC,
corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license in
any other state or province.
      (3)   Each application shall be accompanied by a certified check, cashier
check, or money order for the amount of the license fee.
      (4)   In addition to the above specified information, the applicant shall
file, with the application, responses to any additional questions as may be
posed or prescribed by the City ABC Administrator. The City Council has adopted
a statement of guidelines and priorities for the issuance of licenses within
this chapter to determine the extent to which applications may further, or
impede, the objectives of those guidelines. Therefore, in addition to the
information contained in the application, the City ABC Administrator may
require such other information as the City ABC Administrator may, in his or her
discretion, deem desirable, reasonable, or appropriate to the consideration of
the application.
   (C)   Other conditions. In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or
considerations required or permitted by law:
      (1)   The City ABC Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage
license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his or her
place of business shall have been approved by a licensed building inspector,
and any and all other inspections required by the Kentucky Building Code or
other applicable law;
      (2)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be granted or
renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any prope1ty taxes,
both real and personal, any other taxes due to the city, fees of any type, or
charges due to any department of the city at the time of issuing the license,
nor may any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or
property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any of the
above delinquent payments due and owing to the city. Further, if a licensee
becomes delinquent in the payment of any of the above at any time during the
license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be subject
to revocation or suspension.
      (3)   No person, whether applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in
any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the City
ABC Administrator, or any member of the city's staff, or any state ABC
Administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This division is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration anct enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or state ABC
Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a
license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for
appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this
chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit monetary
settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order
or revocation or suspension, where the chapter and applicable statutes allow
for such payments in settlement.
   (D)   Denial of licenses.
      (1)   The City ABC Administrator may deny a city license for any of the
following reasons:
         (a)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for
suspension or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for
state licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as
violation of any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or
the administration thereof.
         (b)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of
license would be authorized under local, state, or federal law; or
         (c)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
      (2)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the City ABC
Administrator may appeal the refusal to the state Board pursuant division (K)
below.
   (E)   Form of license. All city licenses shall be in such form as may be
provided by the ABC Administrator, but at the least shall contain:
      (1)   The name and address of the licensee;
      (2)   The number of the license;
      (3)   The type of license;
      (4)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the licensed
premises;
      (5)   The expiration date of the license;
      (6)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a property
or vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to law.
   (F)   Change of information.
      (1)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the City ABC Administrator with ten days of the change.
      (2)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The
City ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
      (3)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other
business organization herein, the word CHANGE is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the
corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures 10% of
the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than 10% of the total
ownership or stock shall require a new license.
      (4)   The following information shall be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
         (a)   Name and address;
         (b)   Nature of interest;
         (c)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         (d)   Date of birth;
         (e)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of
Kentucky. If a resident, indicate when residence was established;
         (f)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license
or in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding
a license under this act;
         (g)   Extent of stock or company ownership;
         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in
any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license in any other state or province.
      (5)   This information shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator as
a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten days of any change of required
information.
   (G)   Renewal of license.
      (1)   Every year, except in the case of the temporary licenses, each
licensee shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the
City ABC Administrator no less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the
license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except
where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises
licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act
of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the
premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private
organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
exiting lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less than 20 days from the expiration date of the license, setting
forth these facts, and the City ABC Administrator is hereby authorized to
extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a reasonable length
of time within the sound discretion of the City ABC Administrator; provided,
however, such licensee shall payla license fee from the expiration date of the
former license or licenses. Said license fee shall not by payable until
application is made for the transfer of said license to a new location.
      (2)   The renewal by the City ABC Administrator of the license shall not
be construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior
to such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the
licensee.
   (H)   Lost or destroyed license. When a license shall be lost or destroyed
without fault on the part of the licensee or his or her agent or employee, a
duplicate in lieu of the original license shall be issued by the City ABC
Administrator after the Administrator shall have been satisfied as to the
facts; provided, however, that the applicant for said duplicate license shall
pay a fee of $10 for the duplicate license.
   (I)   Revocation or suspension.
      (1)   Any license may be revoked or suspended by the City ABC
Administrator if the licensee shall have violated any of other provisions of
KRS Ch. 241 to Ch. 244, or any rule or regulation of the state Board, or of the
Kentucky Department of Revenue, relating to the regulation of the manufacture,
sale, and transportation, or taxation, of alcoholic beverages or if such
licensee shall have violated or shall violate any act of Congress or any rule
or regulation of any federal board, agency or commission, or this chapter now,
heretofore, or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the
manufacture, sale, and transportation, or taxation, of intoxicating liquors, or
any rules or regulations of the city heretofore in existence or authorized by
the terms of KRS Ch. 241 to Ch. 244 to be created, irrespective of whether the
licensee knew of or permitted the violation or whether the violation was
committed is disobedience of his or her instructions.
      (2)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the City
ABC Administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had
been known.
      (3)   In addition to the foregoing slated causes, any license may be
revoked or suspended for the following causes:
         (a)   Conviction of the licensee or the licensee's agent, servant, or
employee for selling any illegal alcoholic beverages on the licensed premises;
         (b)   Making any false, material statements in an application or
renewal application for a license or supplemental license;
         (c)   Conviction of the licensee or any of the licensee's agents,
servants or employees of:
            1.   Two violations of the terms and provisions of KRS Ch. 241 to

alcoholic beverages within two consecutive years;
            2.   Two misdemeanors directly or indirectly attributable to the
use of alcoholic beverages within two consecutive years; or
            3.   Any felony.
         (d)   Failure or default of a licensee to pay an excise tax or any
part of the tax or any penalties imposed by or under the provisions of any
statutes, ordinances, or Acts of Congress relative to taxation, or for a
violation of any related administrative regulations promulgated by the
Department of Revenue.
         (e)   Revocation of any state license provided in KRS 243.030,

premises, any gambling game, device, machine, contrivance, lottery, gift

Chapter 154A;

controlled or illegal substances described in KRS Chapter 218A, including
synthetic drugs;
            2.   Knowingly permitting the trafficking or possession by patrons
upon the licensed premises of controlled or illegal substances described in KRS
Ch. 218A, including synthetic drugs; or
            3.   Knowh1gly receiving stolen property upon the licensed
premises.
         (h)   Failure to comply with the terms of the City Administrator.
   (J)   Proceedings for revocation or suspension of license.
      (1)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of
any law enforcement officer, or of the City ABC Administrator, the City ABC
Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license
granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after
the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered
mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such
proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in
opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or
in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
      (2)   The specific procedures to be followed in bearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall provide constitutional due process rights to the
city ABC license bolder.

license may be appealed to Board as provided in KRS 241.200 and KRS 243.550.
      (4)   Within three days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A
notice mailed to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises at the
address shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement
supplemental to the application shall be deemed sufficient compliance with this
section. The licensee shall at once surrender his or her license to the City
ABC Administrator. If the revoked or suspended license is not forthwith
surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of Police, at the request of the City
ABC Administrator, shall immediately cause one of his or her officers to take
physical possession of the license and return it to the City ABC Administrator.
      (5)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee
may, with prior approval of the City ABC Administrator, dispose of and transfer
his or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
      (6)   An appeal from the decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking
or suspending a license shall be to the state Board pursuant to division (K)
below. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay further proceedings for
revocation.
      (7)   If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the City ABC
Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall suspend all
operations authorized under his or her license upon
finality and effectiveness of the order. Upon finality of any final order of
the state Board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on appeal, the
licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under the suspended or
revoked license.
   (K)   Appeals.
      (1)   Appeals from the orders of the City ABC Administrator may be taken
to the state ABC Board by filing a notice of appeal with the Board within 30
days after the decision or order of the City ABC Administrator is mailed or
delivered by personal service. The notice of appeal shall specify the City
Administrator by name and shall identify the decision or order, or part of the
decision or order, being appealed. The notice shall contain a certificate that
a copy of the notice has been served on the City ABC Administrator and shall be
accompanied by a copy of the decision or order being appealed. Matters at issue
shall be heard by the Board as upon an original proceeding. Appeals from
decisions or orders of the City ABC administrator shall be governed by KRS Ch.
13B.
      (2)   As provided by law no appealed City ABC Administrator order or
decision, or resulting state Board order, shall become effective or final until
all Board appeals, court appeals, or appeal times shall have been exhausted.
When a Board order becomes final and effective, the City ABC Administrator,
shall enter such orders and take such action as required by the final order of
the Board.
   (L)   Transfer or assignment. No license issued under this chapter shall be
transferred or assigned either as to licensee or location except with prior
approval of the City ABC Administrator and not then until a payment of $100
shall be made to the City ABC Administrator.
   (M)   Review of license, books, records and reports.
      (1)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter
shall provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions
of any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant's business income is earned from the sale
of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated
with the applicant's
quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide the form schedule to
the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to manufacture or traffic
in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the filing of the quarterly
report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly report shall identity each
catered event by type of event, date and address of the event, and shall
provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of food sales to alcohol
sales during the reporting period. This requirement for filing of reports
notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the premises of any
licensee and examine the books and records to determine whether the licensee is
in compliance with all parts of this chapter. In the event the conditions of
any license requirement are not met during any particular quarter, the City ABC
Administrator shall have discretion in determining whether revocation is
appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time
to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee,
the City ABC Administrator may apply an accounting period of at least one year
in determining whether or not the food sale percentage requirement has been
met.
      (2)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain, upon the
licensed premises, adequate books and records of all transactions involved in
the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the City ABC Administrator and such city
employees who may assist the City ABC Administrator in his or her review.
   (N)   Dormancy.
      (1)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after 90 days. Such is the intent of this section.
Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her business
interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various exceptions to
the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
      (2)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period
of 90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in
division (N)(3) below are proved to the satisfaction of the City ABC
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the City
ABC Administrator.
      (3)   The provisions of division (N)(2) above shall not apply to any
licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a
license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing
lease. Prior to the expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall
furnish to the City ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the
fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the
specific reasons set forth herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an
extension of the dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect
during the license period or until same is transferred to another premises,
notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted during said period;
provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid unless business is
conducted there under within 12 months from the date of notice to the City ABC
Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of
his or her sound discretion.
(Ord. 19-0008, passed 8-1-19)

as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the net profits by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B), plus the
sales factor, described in division (C), and the denominator of which is two;
and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profits by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C).
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.

factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income- producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly

business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the

as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the

verify the accuracy of a taxpayer s reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income

defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this subchapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by
the federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting
required for federal income tax purposes.

ability to make reparation or restitution to the victim; and

§ 152.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of this chapter that storm water runoff controls be
provided when land areas are developed or redeveloped.
(Ord. 16-04, passed 5-16-16)
§ 152.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER." The person designated to administer the
provisions of this ordinance under the direction of the City Administrator.
   "CONTROLLED RELEASE STRUCTURE." A facility constructed to regulate the
volume of storm water runoff that is conveyed during a specific length of time.
   "DEVELOPED." Conditions after construction or other man-made change to
improved or unimproved, including but not limited to, buildings or other
structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling
operations.
   "EXCESS STORM WATER." That portion of storm water runoff that exceeds the
capacity of storm sewers or natural drainage channels serving a specific
watershed.
   "EXCESS STORM WATER PASSAGE." A channel formed in the ground surface to
carry storm water runoff that cannot be carried by normal drainage channels.
   "IMPERVIOUS SURFACE." Asphalt, concrete, or any other surface which does not
allow measurable infiltration.
   "NATURAL DRAINAGE." Water that follows by gravity in channels formed by the
surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by the efforts of man.
   "ON-SITE." Internal to the boundary of a development.
(Ord. 16-04, passed 5-16-16)
§ 152.03 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FOR DEVELOPERS.
   (A)   All developments undertaken as outlined in this chapter shall be done
in such a way as to insure that storm water falling on a given site shall be
absorbed or retained onsite to the extent that after development the rate of
water leaving the site shall not be significantly different than if the site
had remained undeveloped.
   (B)   A developer shall not be permitted to disturb the land in such a
manner as to create significant water related damages to other landowners in
the vicinity by having point discharge creating erosion across land or placing
obstructions where flood peak increases. If the point discharge is high enough
to produce erosion, other measures shall be taken to dissipate the flow.
   (C)   Where it can be demonstrated by the developer that a higher storm
water release rate will not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this
chapter and where such proposed release rate will not adversely affect
properties in the downstream portion of the watershed, the Code Enforcement
Officer may permit such release to be used as deemed appropriate.
(Ord. 16-04, passed 5-16-16)
§ 152.04 EXCESS STORM WATER PASSAGES.
   (A)   An excess storm water passage shall be provided for all storm water
areas. Such passage shall have the capacity to convey through the proposed
development the excess storm water. The capacity for a passage shall be such
that it will be able to transport the peak rate of runoff from a 100-year
return frequency storm.
   (B)   There shall be no buildings or structures constructed within excess
storm passages; however, parking lots, playgrounds, and park areas, which shall
not impair or endanger the water holding capability of a development shall be
considered compatible uses.
   (C)   Appropriate land planning shall be undertaken to preserve the existing
natural drainage of a proposed development as part of the excess storm water
passage.
   (D)   Open channels shall be protected from erosion by appropriate
vegetative cover, lining, or other treatment and earthen channel side slopes
shall be no steeper than two-to-one. Open channels with lining shall have a
maximum gradient on side slopes of 67% and channel sides steeper than 67% shall
be designed as structural retaining walls.
(Ord. 16-04, passed 5-16-16)
§ 152.05 RUNOFF AND STORAGE CAPACITY.
   The volume of required storm water storage and runoff shall be calculated on
the basis of the runoff from a 100-year frequency storm with a three-hour
duration. The calculations can be made in accordance with the instantaneous
runoff factor method, the rational method, or other methods that may be deemed
appropriate by the Code Enforcement Officer.
(Ord. 16-04, passed 5-16-16)
§ 152.06 STORM WATER STORAGE AREAS.
   (A)   Storage areas shall be designed to the satisfaction of the Code
Enforcement Officer and if possible to provide secondary purposes for
recreation, open spaces, parking lots, or other types of uses that will not be
adversely affected by intermittent flooding.
   (B)   All storm water storage areas must be designed to contain and safely
pass storm water runoff. The combined capacity of these storage areas shall be
sufficient to contain the storm from the development. The retention facility
must be designed for periodic maintenance and energy dissipaters shall be
provided at points necessary. The combination of storage of the water from a
100-year storm and the design release rate shall not result in a storage
duration in excess of 72 hours.
   (C)   The ponding of storm water runoff shall not exceed a depth of one foot
on pedestrian mall areas or 134 feet maximum in parking lots. Where these areas
are used for ponding, the maximum depth should occur in the most remote and
least used areas.
   (D)   The drainage and grading design shall be prepared to insure that in a
100-year storm the depth of water runoff in any street, alley or pedestrian
mall will not exceed the level of the first floor of any building.
   (E)   For a 100-year storm, the ponding of surface water on local,
collector, and arterial streets must not exceed a depth of 18 inches at the
gutter; water exceeding this shall be designed to overflow into an excess storm
water passage. The maximum velocity of water in the deepest part of the gutter
shall have a minimum grade of 0.5%.
   (F)   Overflow for each storm water storage area shall be provided in the
event a storm in excess of the design capacity occurs. Such overflow shall be
constructed to function without specific attention and shall become part of the
excess storm water passage.
   (G)   Where rooftop storage of excess storm water is provided, the building
shall be provided with adequate structural design to insure that roof failure
does not occur. Overflow areas shall be provided so that the weight of stored
storm water will not exceed the structural capacity of the roof.
   (H)   For wet pond storage areas when calculating the storage capacity, only
the volume available to store excess storm water shall be considered. Permanent
water storage does not constitute control of excess storm runoff.
(Ord. 16-04, passed 5-16-16)
§ 152.07 SINKHOLES AND SUBTERRANEAN WATER CHANNELS.
   (A)   The use of sinkholes or subterranean water channels for direct
drainage of excess storm water shall not be permitted although they may be used
to drain a storm water storage area. The introduction of any foreign matter or
the filling, clogging, or interfering with the natural drainage capabilities of
the sinkholes shall not be permitted.
   (B)   Any person, firm, or corporation proposing alterations, improvements,
or other disturbances of any sinkholes or known subterranean water channel must
submit plans to the Code Enforcement Officer showing that the disturbance would
not interfere with the drainage capability. Also included in the plans, erosion
control methods must be shown for any activities that might create erosion or
soil sedimentation.
   (C)   Sinkholes shall not be altered or covered in any way that would
negatively affect the drainage capabilities of the sinkhole. Development within
the 100-year floodplain of a sinkhole shall not be permitted.
(Ord. 16-04, passed 5-16-16)
§ 152.08 APPLICATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   An application is required to be submitted to the Code Enforcement
Officer prior to subdivision approval or issuance of a building permit for each
of the following proposed improvement within the corporate limits of Marion:
      (1)   Residential development of two acres or more;
      (2)   Commercial and all other non-residential development of one acre or

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS Ch. 100 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Marion, Kentucky (the "city") hereby
adopts this chapter setting forth provisions for floodplain management.
(Ord. 19-15, passed 11-18-19)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses ore caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 19-15, passed 11-18-19)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 19-15, passed 11-18-19)
§ 153.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 19-15, passed 11-18-19)
§ 153.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "A ZONE." Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual chance flood
(100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFBs) are not determined.
   "ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE)." A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns
and hay sheds.
   "ACCESSORY USE." A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   "ADDITION (to an existing structure)." Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter or height of a structure.
   "AE ZONES." Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual chance
flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFBs) are determined.
   "AH ZONE." An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are determined.
   "AO ZONE." An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
determined.
   "APPEAL." A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator's ruling on a request for a variance.
   "AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A ZONES." Special flood hazard zones
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-

technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: The applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby base
flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than +0.5 foot. Cross sections
elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in
slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain
change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and
shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the Cabinet. If
necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the Cabinet
may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend
beyond those needed for making routine regulatory flood way boundary
calculations.

automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this requirement
must meet or exceed the standards of division (C) below.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the

(Ord. 19-15, passed 11-18-19)
APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 153.40 APPEALS; VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature Of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided In this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted, The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The City Council shall
establish a Variance and Appeal Board consisting of the City Board of
Adjustment.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeal Board.
      (1)   The Variance and Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Variance and Appeal
Board may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky
Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Variance
and Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant facts,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and Its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
existing or proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent use;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rato of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters; and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Variance and Appeal Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "MINIMUM NECESSARY" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council not grant permission for
the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant
proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will both
provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in § 153.05 under
"PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE"), cause fraud or victimization of the public, as
defined in §
153.05 or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
      (5)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of division (D) above
are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by
methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result
in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the City Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and
report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures, as defined in §
153.05, upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(Ord. 19-15, passed 11-18-19)
§ 153.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no less than $100 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and
in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day
such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
