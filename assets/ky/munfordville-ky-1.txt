      (3)   Mailing a copy of the citation by regular first-class mail to the
last known recorded mailing address of the alleged violator; or
      (4)   If, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the issuance of a

possible, then the citation is properly served by posting a copy of the
citation in a conspicuous place on the premises.
   (C)   When authorized by ordinance, a code enforcement officer may, in lieu

prescribed by the City Council and shall contain, in addition to any other
information required by ordinance or rule of the Board:
      (1)   The date and time of issuance;
      (2)   The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued;
      (3)   The date and time the offense was committed;
      (4)   The facts constituting the offense;
      (5)   The section of the code or the number of the ordinance violated;
      (6)   The name of the code enforcement officer;
      (7)   The civil fine that will be imposed for the violation if the person
does not contest the violation if the city has elected to use the alternative
authorized under KRS 65.8808(2)(b);
      (8)   The maximum civil fine that may be imposed if the person elects to
contest the citation;
      (9)   The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil
fine or to contest the citation; and
      (10)   A statement that if the person fails to pay the civil fine set
forth in the citation or contest the citation, within the time allowed, the
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing before the Code
Enforcement Board to contest the citation and that the determination that a
violation was committed shall be final, and the alleged violator shall be
deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court.
   (E)   After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, the code enforcement
officer shall notify the Code Enforcement Board by delivering the citation to

issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation
was issued by either paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or

Enforcement Board shall take testimony from the code enforcement officer, the

the proceedings.
   (J)   At the hearing, the Code Enforcement Board shall determine, based on
the evidence presented, whether a violation was committed. When the Board
determines that no violation was committed, an order dismissing the citations
shall be entered. When the Board determines that the violation has been
committed, the Board may issue an order upholding the citation and may order
the offender to pay a civil fine in an amount up to the maximum authorized by
Chapter 92 and any city ordinance that the Board has jurisdiction to enforce.
   (K)   Every final order following a hearing of the Code Enforcement Board
shall be reduced to writing, which shall include the findings and conclusions
of the Board, the date the order was issued, and a copy of the order shall be
furnished to the person named in the citation. If the person named in the
citation is not present at the time a final order of the Board is issued, the
order shall be delivered to that person by certified mail, return receipt
requested; by personal delivery; or by leaving a copy of the order at that
person’s usual place of residence with any individual residing therein who is
18 years of age or older and who is informed of the contents of the order.
   (L)   Appeals; final judgment. Appeals from any final order issued by the
Code Enforcement Board may be made in the manner specified in KRS 65.8831.
   (M)   Lien; fines; charges.
      (1)   The city shall possess a lien on property owned by the person found
by a final, non-appealable order of the Board as defined by KRS 65.8805(8), or
by a final judgment of the court, to have committed a violation of Chapter 92
and any city ordinance that the Board has jurisdiction to enforce, for all
civil fines assessed for the violation and for all charges and fees incurred by
the city in connection with the enforcement of the ordinance including
abatement costs. The lien shall be recorded in the office of the City Clerk.
      (2)   The lien shall be notice to all persons from the time of its
recording and shall bear interest until paid. Subject to KRS 65.8836, the lien
shall take precedence over all other liens, except state, county, school board,
and city taxes, and may be enforced by judicial proceedings including an action
to foreclose. The lien shall continue for ten years following the date of the
non- appealable final order, or final judgment of the court.
   (N)   In addition to the remedy prescribed in division (M) above, the person
found to have committed the violation shall be personally responsible for the
amount of the lien, including all civil fines assessed for the violation and
for all charges, fees and abatement costs incurred by the city in connection
with the enforcement of the ordinance. The city may bring a civil action
against the person and shall have the same remedies as provided for the
recovery of a debt.
   (O)   Nothing in this section shall otherwise affect the rights or
obligations between the owner of the property and those persons who claim a
security interest in the property.
   (P)   Nothing contained in this subchapter shall prohibit the city from
taking immediate action to remedy a violation of Chapter 92 and any city
ordinance that the Board has jurisdiction to enforce, when there is reason to
believe that the existence of the violation presents a serious threat to the
public health, safety, and welfare, or if in the absence of immediate action
the offense of the violation will be irreparable or irreversible. In addition,
nothing contained herein shall prohibit the enforcement of Chapter 92 and any
city ordinance that the Board has jurisdiction to enforce, by any other means
authorized.
(Ord. 12-021, passed 7-13-21)
§ 35.04 ORDINANCE FINE SCHEDULE.

of real estate, the construction of buildings and appurtenances, the
preparation of plans and specifications, and legal and other services
incidental to the project or to the issuance of the bonds. The payment of the
bonds, with interest, may be secured by a pledge of and a first lien on all of
the receipts and revenue derived, or to be derived, from the rental or
operation of the property involved. Bond and interest obligations issued
pursuant to this section shall not constitute an indebtedness of the county or
city. All bonds sold under the authority of this section shall be subject to
competitive bidding as provided by law, and shall bear interest at a rate not
to exceed that established for bonds issued for public projects under KRS
Chapter 58.

turn over all money collected to the TCC.

audit the books and records of any taxpayer or restaurant operator under this
section to determine if there have been complete and accurate reporting of

due has been made. The City Clerk may use the services of an accounting
professional to perform the audit or assist in the performance of the audit.
      (2)   The City Clerk shall notify the taxpayer in writing, at the address
shown on the application for a city occupational license, at least three
calendar days in advance that an audit is to be conducted on the premises of
the taxpayer, the date and time the audit is to commence, and the documents and
records that shall be made available by the taxpayer to perform the audit.

transferred to it within the guidelines of the Kentucky Revised Statutes.

§ 38.04 PROCEDURES.
   The following grievance procedures are set forth for any person who believes
that he or she has been subjected to discrimination based on handicapped status
as prohibited by the Federal Revenue Sharing program regulations and Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
   The purpose of the procedures is to assure the prompt and equitable
resolution of complaints alleging such discrimination. These procedures do not

under procedures set forth in the personnel policies and procedures.
   (A)   Step one. Any person with a grievance concerning handicapped access to
programs, services, and benefits that the city provides shall present the
grievance, in writing, to the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall attempt to
correct the matter immediately, if possible, or provide a written response
within five days specifying the action to be taken and the deadline for such
action.
   (B)   Step two. If the complainant is not satisfied with the response of the
City Clerk, or if no action is taken, the written grievance shall be submitted
to the Mayor. The Mayor shall meet with the complainant or his representative
to discuss the problem informally. Documentation of this meeting shall be
prepared and maintained in the local government's files. The Mayor shall
provide a written response within 15 days of the informal meeting concerning
the action to be taken and the deadline for completion.

regular scheduled meeting. A special meeting of the City Council may be called
if necessary, to discuss the grievance.

any person of his choice to appear with him and participate in the discussion.
Written documentation of the discussion shall be maintained in the city
records.
   (E)   Written decision. The City Council shall issue a written decision on
the matter within 15 days. This decision shall be the final procedure for the
complainant at the local level.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 10-9-84)
§ 38.05 ADA GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The city has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for
prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by
the U.S. Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the
Americans with Disabilities Act. Title II states in part, that "no otherwise
qualified disabled individual shall, solely by reason of such disability, be
excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or subjected to
discrimination" in programs or activities sponsored by a public entity.
   (B)   Complaints should be addressed to the designated individual who is
coordinating ADA compliance efforts. This information can be found through the
City Clerk's Office.
      (1)   A complaint should be filed in writing; contain the name of address
of the person filing it; and briefly describe the alleged violation of the
regulations.
      (2)   A complaint should be filed within 30 working days after the
complainant becomes aware of the alleged violation. (Processing of allegations
of discrimination which occurred before this grievance procedure was in place
will be considered on a case-by case basis.)
      (3)   An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a
complaint.
         (a)   The investigation shall be conducted by the City Council. These
rules contemplate informal but thorough investigations, affording all
interested persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit
evidence relevant to a complaint.
         (b)   Under the Department of Justice regulations the city need not
process complaints from applicants for employment of from applicants for
admission to post-secondary educational institutions.
      (4)   A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and a
description of the resolution, if any, shall be issued by the designated ADA
coordinator and a copy forwarded to the complainant no later than 30 working
days after its filing.
      (5)   The ADA coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the
city relating to the complaints filed.
      (6)   The complainant can request a reconsideration of the case in
instances where he or she is dissatisfied with the resolution. The request for
consideration should be made within 15 days to ADA coordinator.
      (7)   The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the
complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of
other remedies such as the filing of an ADA complaint with the responsible
federal department agency. Use of this grievance procedure is not a
prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies.
      (8)   The rules shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of
interested persons to meet appropriate due process standards, and to assure
that the city complies with the ADA and implementing regulations.

Code of Ethics."
(Ord. 009-94, passed 12-5-94; Am. Ord. 16-021, passed 12-6-21)
§ 39.02 FINDINGS.
   The legislative body of the city finds and declares that:

interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled.
   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their duties.
(Ord. 009-94, passed 12-5-94)
§ 39.03 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring that
standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for officers
and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in their
application, and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
KRS 65.003 as enacted by the Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS

accidental and/or slug discharges of prohibited materials or other substances
regulated by this chapter which adversely affects the POTW. Facilities to
prevent accidental and/or slug discharges of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Once every
two years, the Superintendent will determine whether each industrial user needs
to develop or update a plan to control slug discharges. If the superintendent
determines that a slug control plan or revision is necessary, the plan shall
contain the following: Description of discharge practices; description of
stored chemicals; procedures for notifying the POTW; and prevention procedures
for spills. In the case of all possible or actual accidental and/or slug
discharges, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and
notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
   (B)   Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge,
the user shall submit to the Superintendent a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as
a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this subchapter, the
Enforcement Response Plan or other applicable law.
   (C)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call

   (E)   Penalty for non-payment. A penalty of 20% shall be applied to all
services if not paid by the tenth of each month and if not paid by the 21st of
each month services will be cut off.
   (F)   Disconnection of service for non-payment. If a customer is
disconnected for non-payment of services, there will be a $75 re-connection fee
for reconnections that are performed between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 3:30
p.m. For occasions when the reconnection request is performed after normal
hours, or on weekends or holidays, a $100 reconnection fee will be charged. At
the discretion of he Mayor a one-time amnesty may be applied.
   (G)   Credit card payments. A customer credit card processing fee will be
assessed in an amount equivalent to the actual cost incurred by the city for
processing such customer payments. Such fees will be clearly delineated on
customer bills as a separate line item before the total.
   (H)   Returned check/ACH fee. A $50 fee will be assessed on all returned
checks or automatic draft payments. The fee plus the amount owed must be paid
within ten days of notification. If such payment is not made within that time
period, the services will be disconnected.
   (I)   Billing adjustments. Customers are responsible for the repair and
maintenance of a water supply line from the city meter to their building. At
the discretion of the Mayor, an adjustment may be applied one time each year
for an occurrence of a water leak. Sewer bill adjustments may be given at the
city's sole discretion for an occurrence of a water leak that occurs past the
city meter for that customer, outside the home, on a single month's bill only,
and only once per calendar year. The city may, but is not obligated to, apply
its discretion on these facts: if and only if the Munfordville Public Works
Department (MPWD) was notified of the leak, MPWD confirmed that such leak did
exist, and the customer supplies the city with sufficient proof of repair
having been made to abate such leak. In all cases, leaks found in the city
water supply system and located before a customer's meter, e.g. on a city
street, are the responsibility of the city and as such leaks would not affect a
customer's meter, they are not chargeable to a customer served at a point past
where such leak maybe found.

establishes the following tap-on capacity charges for each separate unit/user
connected to the Munfordville water and sewer system.

trailer park may be authorized under Title XV, Land Usage, of the city's Code
of Ordinances and not otherwise denied connection in accordance with §
50.091(C) above).
         (a)   Tap-on charge. A connection charge of $850 for each separate
residential dwelling unit/user connected to the system is hereby assessed.
      (2)   Commercial connections. Commercial connections shall be defined as
all other classifications than those deemed to be residential under division

such properties, with the exception of rates charged, the city will provide
such services in accordance with all the provisions applicable to the various
classifications of properties situated within the city limits.

   (B)   The city does not intend to automatically apply wholesale rate
increases for sewer as it does for water under § 50.092. However, such

(Accordingly, a total customer bull for both water and sewer will be no less
than $34.24, being thereafter subject to increase on approval of City Council).

(Ord. 001-93, passed 2-1-93)
   ENFORCEMENT
§ 50.110 GENERAL.
   (A)   The city, through the Superintendent or his designee, to insure
compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40 CFR Subchapter N, and
401 KAR 5:055, may take the following enforcement steps against users in
noncompliance with the chapter. The remedies available to the POTW include
injunctive relief, civil and criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of
discharges and/or water service and the publishing of the list of significant
violators annually. The enforcement authority shall be vested in the
Superintendent or their designee.
   (B)   The Superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or
an industrial user permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of
the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city
to violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES permit.
   (C)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the industrial user permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall
reinstate the industrial user permit and/or the wastewater treatment service
upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed
written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be
submitted to the city within 15 days of the date of occurrence.
(Ord. 001-93, passed 2-1-93)
§ 50.111 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Any user found to be violating any provisions of this chapter,
wastewater permit, or any order issued hereunder, shall be served by the city
with written notice stating the nature of the violation(s). Within ten days of
the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted to the Superintendent. Submission of this
plan in no way relieves the user of potential liability for any violation
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   If the violations persist or the explanation and/or plan are not
adequate, the city's response shall be more formal and commitments (or
schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in an enforceable
document. The enforcement response selected will be related to the seriousness
of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if compliance is not
achieved expeditiously after the initial action. A significant noncompliance as
defined in §
50.074 will require a formal enforcement action.
   (C)   The full scale of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the
enforcement response plan.

city. At said appearance, a compliance schedule will be given to the non-
conforming user and an administrative fine assessed. The fine shall be
determined on a case-by-case basis which shall consider the type and severity

period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force
and effect as orders issued pursuant to subdivision (3) below.
      (2)   Compliance order. When the Superintendent or their designee finds
that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the chapter or a
permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user
responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are
properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be
reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including
the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and
management practices.
      (3)   Cease and desist orders. When the Superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit

action, and directing the user to show cause, before the Superintendent, why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt

a value determined by the Superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
   (B)   Liability insurance. The Superintendent may decline to reissue a
permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of

different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or "Go": Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop": Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed

signal.
   (F)   "Yield Right-of-Way": Vehicular traffic facing the "Yield Right-of-
Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a "Yield Right-of-Way"

entering an expressway.
   (G)   Lane lights: When lane lights are installed over any street for the
purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing amber lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from

______________
Editor’s note:
   KRS 376.275(1) and (2) were repealed by SB 71, sec. 12, March 22, 2021.
Current state law provisions concerning notification of owners of towed
vehicles can be found in KRS 281.928.
§ 72.22 SALE OF VEHICLE.
   (A)   (1)   Any person engaged in the business of storing or towing motor
vehicles, who has complied with the notification requirements of KRS 281.928,
shall have a lien on the motor vehicle and its contents, except as set forth in
division (B) below, for the applicable and reasonable charges assessed in
accordance with KRS 281.926 and KRS 281.932, as long as it remains in his or
her possession.
      (2)   If, after a period of 45 days, the applicable and reasonable
charges assessed in KRS 281.926 and KRS 281.932 have not been paid, the motor
vehicle and its contents, except as set forth in division (B) below, may be
sold to pay the charges after the owner and any lienholder have been notified
by certified mail at the addresses specified in KRS 281.928(1), ten days prior
to the time and place of the sale. If the proceeds of the sale of any vehicle
pursuant to this section are insufficient to satisfy accrued charges, the sale
and collection of proceeds shall not constitute a waiver or release of
responsibility for payment of unpaid charges by the owner or responsible
casualty insurer of the vehicle. A lien on a vehicle under this division (A)(2)
shall be subject to prior recorded liens, unless released by any existing
lienholder pursuant to division (C) below.
   (C)   A lienholder having a prior recorded lien listed on the title issued
by the Commonwealth of Kentucky shall be notified by certified mail within the
first ten days of impoundment in accordance with KRS 281.928. Such
notification, in addition to the requirements of KRS 281.928 shall include the
make, model, license number, vehicle identification number, owner’s name and
last known address, and tentative date of sale for the vehicle, and state that
the towing company or storage facility seeks to obtain a new title free and
clear of any liens, excluding tax liens. If the above-referenced certified
letter is not sent within the ten days by the towing and storage company, then
only ten days of storage may be charged. The lienholder has the right to take
possession of the motor vehicle after showing proof of lien still enforced, and
paying the reasonable or agreed towing and storage charges on the motor
vehicle. If a lienholder does not exercise the right to take possession of the
motor vehicle under this division (C) within 45 days of notification, and all
lienholders agree in writing, the towing company or storage facility may obtain
a new title under KRS 186A.145 free and clear of any liens, excluding tax
liens. Nothing in this section shall allow the transfer of a vehicle subject to
a lien, except as provided in KRS 186A.190.
   (D)   If there are no lienholders required to be notified under KRS 281.920
to 281.936, KRS 359.230, and this section, the owner does not exercise the
right to take possession of the motor vehicle under this section within 45 days
of notification required under KRS 281.928, the tow company or storage facility
may obtain a new title under KRS 186A.145 free and clear of any liens,
excluding tax liens.

SNOW EMERGENCY
§ 72.35 ANNOUNCEMENT OF SNOW EMERGENCY.
   Whenever the Chief of Police or other authorized city official finds that
falling snow, sleet, or freezing rain will create a condition which makes it
necessary that the parking of motor vehicles on snow emergency routes be
prohibited, or whenever he finds on the basis of a firm forecast of snow,
sleet, or freezing rain that the weather conditions so forecasted may create a
condition making it necessary that such parking be prohibited, he is authorized
to announce such prohibition, to become effective at a time specified by him.
After the effective time of such prohibition no person shall park any vehicle
or permit any vehicle to remain parked on a snow emergency route. However, if a
fall of snow, sleet, or freezing rain occurs after 11:00 p.m. and prior to 6:00
a.m., and the Chief of Police or other authorized city official has not
announced prior to 11:00 p.m. that parking on snow emergency routes is to be
prohibited after a specified time, a vehicle parked on a snow emergency route
may remain so parked until 7:00 a.m. following such fall. The prohibition of
parking announced by the Chief of Police or other authorized city official
under the authority of this section shall remain in effect until he announces
the termination of the snow emergency, in part or in whole, after which the
prohibition of parking authorized by this section shall no longer be in effect.
Penalty, see §
72.99
§ 72.36 TERMINATION OF EMERGENCY.
   Whenever the Chief of Police or other authorized city official shall find
that some or all of the conditions which gave rise to the snow emergency
prohibition no longer exist, he is authorized to declare the termination of the
emergency, in part or in whole, effective immediately on announcement. If such
announcement is made other than between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., it shall be
repeated between those hours.
§ 72.37 SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES.
   The term "SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTE" shall mean any route designated by the Chief
of Police or other authorized city official. On such street or highway
designated as a snow emergency route, special signs shall be posted to this
effect.

for any purpose or reason other than for the intended purpose and reason for
the existence of the off-street parking facility, provided that the intended
purpose or reason is clearly set out on signs posted at each entrance and exit
to the off-street parking facility. However, it shall not be a violation of
this section if the operator of the motor vehicle has been given written
permission from the person in possession and control of the off-street parking
facility to so use or park thereon in any other otherwise lawful manner.
   (B)   It shall also be unlawful for any person, whether acting individually
or in concert with a group of persons, to gather, park, or stop on any off-

practice or who believes that he will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person
aggrieved") may file a complaint with the Chief Executive Officer. Complaints
shall be in writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as
the Chief Executive Officer requires. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the
Chief Executive Officer shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or
persons who allegedly committed or who is/are about to commit the alleged
discriminatory housing practice. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or
within 30 days after the expiration of any period of reference under division
(C), the Chief Executive Officer shall investigate the complaint and give
notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it. If
the Chief Executive Officer decides to resolve the complaints, he shall proceed
to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by
informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Nothing said or
done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made public or used as
evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter without the written
consent of the persons concerned. Any employee of the Chief Executive Officer
who shall make public any information in violation of this provision shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not
more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) shall be filed within 180 days after
the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be in
writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint
against him and with the leave of the Chief Executive Officer, which shall be
granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his answer
at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chief Executive Officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance with this chapter, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days
thereafter, file a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The Chief Executive Officer will assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the Chief Executive Officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance within 30 days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30
days here after commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this chapter, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint.
If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such
practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the

   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the Chief Executive Officer shall have
access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals,
and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and
copy such materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such
persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation:
provided, however, that the Chief Executive Officer first complies with the
provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and
seizures. The Chief Executive Officer may issue subpoenas to compel his access
to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and
may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to
the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were
issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States District Court
for the district in which the investigation is taking place. The Chief
Executive Officer may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the Chief Executive Officer, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the name of the Chief Executive Officer to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued by the Chief Executive Officer himself.
Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their face the
name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were issued at
his request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Chief Executive Officer shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in United States district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the Chief Executive Officer to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The Chief Executive Officer shall grant the petition if he finds that
the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or
place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any
matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly
onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Chief
Executive Officer or other person at whose request it was issued may petition
for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which
the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts
business.
   (F)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or other evidence,
if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the
Chief Executive Officer shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not
more than one year, or both. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the
Chief Executive Officer, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or
statement of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted
to the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or
shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true, and
correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or
shall willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary
evidence, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one
year, or both.

Executive Officer participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this

of general jurisdiction. A civil action shall be commenced within 180 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred: provided, however,
that the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section
or §
96.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the Chief Executive Officers are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice
complained of in the complaint made to the Chief Executive Officer and which
practice forms the basis for the action in court: and provided, however, that
any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court
order issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fide
purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of
the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter
shall not be affected.

or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs' and reasonable attorney fees in the case of

writing with the City Clerk who shall fix the time and place for a hearing

§ 115.01 FINDINGS, DECLARATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, PURPOSE.
 
   (A)   Findings. The City Council of Munfordville, Kentucky, based on
evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually explicit
entertainment activities on the community, presented in hearings and in
reports, and in findings incorporated in numerous cases heard by the United
States Supreme Court, and in studies in many communities around the country,
finds as follows:
      (1)   Certain sexually explicit entertainment activities, which are or
may become located near areas zoned for residential use, near schools and
public parks, and near malls and similar open spaces that are catered to by
family groups and children, would adversely effect the viability and use of
such properties for such purposes;
      (2)   The city has spent untold dollars on community development and
neighborhood enhancement projects over the past years to attempt to eliminate
blight and to further prevent deterioration of the city's neighborhood;
      (3)   Certain sexually explicit entertainment activities, because of the
condition of their operations, have or may contribute to an increased incidence
of crime and juvenile delinquency, particularly when such activities are
located in close proximity to one another;
      (4)   Certain sexually explicit entertainment activities, particularly
through outside displays, tend to attract undesirable clientele that discourage
residents from undertaking civic improvements and cause residents and
businesses to move elsewhere. Further they may frustrate attempts to attract to
new residents and businesses to the city, all of which factors contribute to a
diminution of property values and to a general deterioration of the city's
neighborhoods;
      (5)   The value of free expression in a free society can be protected by
affording an opportunity for products and services to be sold at distinct and
separate locations where such goods and services will be just as available to
the public wishing to pay for them, but with a dramatically less deleterious
effect on abutting neighborhoods;
      (6)   The concentration of sexually explicit movies, books, videos, and
sexual paraphernalia in the city may create public nuisances and may have a
deleterious effect on property values;
      (7)   Nationally there is extensive involvement of organized crime in the
business of sexually explicit entertainment activities which is regulated
herein, and the disclosure of the names of person who own as well as the names
of persons who operate sexually explicit book stores and other sexually
explicit entertainment establishments, would aid law enforcement officials in
the enforcement of the Racketeer Influenced and Corruptions Organizations Act
(RICO), as well as the enforcement of the laws of the state prohibiting the
distribution of obscene matter, the use of minors to distribute obscene matter,
advertising of obscene matter, distribution of obscene matter to minors,
promoting sale of obscenity, the use of minors in sexual performances, the
distribution of portrayal of sexual performances by a minor, promotion of
material portraying a sexual performance by a minor, advertising o f material
portraying a sexual performance by a minor; and the use of a minor to
distribute material portraying a sexual performance by a minor.
   (B)   Declarations of Public Policy. The Board of Commissioners declare, as
a matter of public policy, that in order to preserve surrounding neighborhoods,
prevent blight, and the deterioration of the neighborhoods, protect property
values, promote the return of residences and businesses to the City's
neighborhoods, protect children from the deleterious effects of exposure to
sexually explicit material, reduce the spread of communicable diseases, and
decrease the incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency, the licensing and
regulation of a sexually explicit entertainment establishment is a public
necessity and is required in the interest of public health, safety and welfare,
and the economic and aesthetic well being of the people.
   (C)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to effect the declaration of
public policy set forth above as it relates to the foregoing findings of the
Board of Commissioners, and more particularly to:
      (1)   Protect neighborhoods;
      (2)   Prevent neighborhoods from suffering the noise, the blighting
influence, and the increase in crime brought about by a concentration of
sexually explicit entertainment establishments;
      (3)   Prevent unsanitary conditions that exist in sexually explicit
businesses and to reduce the spread of communicable diseases;
      (4)   Protect children from the deleterious effects of exposure to
sexually explicit matter;
      (5)   Obtain sufficient information to identify those persons licensed or
to be licensed for the operation of establishments selling, showing, or renting
sexually explicit materials or providing sexually explicit services.

return receipt requested, or personal delivery. At the hearing, the Director
shall afford the licensee or applicant an opportunity to be represented by an
attorney, to present evidence, to cross examine adverse witnesses, and
otherwise to rebut the evidence presented against the licensee or applicant.
Within three days after the hearing and based upon evidence received at the
hearing, the Director shall issue his or her findings and shall determine the
sanction, if any, to be imposed on the licensee or applicant, or upon the owner
of the licensed establishment which may include suspension of the licensee's
license for a period not to exceed one year, revocation of the license, or

reasonably should have known of the violation for which the license is
suspended or refused and failed to take steps to promptly cure the violation.
      (4)   The findings and rulings of any hearing before the Director shall
be a final determination of the issues raised unless appealed. Any such appeal

final decision of the Director, then the city shall immediately issue a
provisional license to the applicant or to the licensee and that licensee or
applicant may operate or continue to operate a sexually oriented business
pending the entry of a judgment on the appeal.
      (5)   The Director is empowered to enact from time to time whatever rules
and regulations are deemed necessary for the orderly and complete
administration of this chapter as the need arises for such rules and
regulations.

   (B)   In determining the amount and method of paying a fine for commission
of a felony, the court shall consider, among others, the following factors:
      (1)   The defendant's ability to pay the amount of the fine;
      (2)   The hardship likely to be imposed on the defendant's dependents by

POSSESSION OR SALE OF AM, CP, JWH OR HU CANNABINOIDS
§ 140.01 DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND POLICY.
   (A)   The city finds that herbal incense products marketed in the United
States that provide a marijuana-like high when smoked have become increasingly
popular, particularly among teens and young adults and that these products
consist of plant material that has been laced with chemicals that have not been
approved by the FDA for human consumption.
   (B)   The Court further finds that the Commonwealth of Kentucky has moved to
prohibit the sale and possession of similar products, but the changing nature
of the products has resulted in the availability of herbal incense products
that exceed the Commonwealth's definition and statutes and therefore are not
properly regulated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The Court is aware that the
side effects of the unregulated herbal incense products pose a threat to the
public health and safety of the citizens of the county and it is in the best
interests of the county to regulate the sale and use of such products.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky has in KRS Chapter 100 delegated to local government units the
authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council hereby adopts
the following floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by
the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
      (7)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 005-08, passed 6-2-08)
§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   "A ZONE." Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   "ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE)." A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principle structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   "ACCESSORY USE." A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   "ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE)." Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   "A1-30 AND AE ZONES." Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   "AH ZONE." An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   "AO ZONE." An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   "APPEAL." A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator's ruling on a request for a variance.
   "AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AND AR/A ZONES." Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   "A99 ZONE." That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system
under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   "AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING." A designated AO or AH zone on a community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to
three feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   "B AND X ZONES (SHADED)." Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   "BASE FLOOD." A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the "100—year flood"). Base flood is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   "BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)." The elevation shown on the flood insurance
rate map (FIRM) for zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and
AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that
has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   "BASEMENT." That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   "BUILDING." A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for "STRUCTURE".
   "C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES." Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   "COMMUNITY." A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   "COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS)." A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the
regular program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures for protection from flooding.
   "COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA)." An area that has been determined by
the Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   "CRITICAL FACILITY." Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. Critical facilities include, but are not

avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools; nursing homes;
hospitals; police, fire and emergency response installations; vehicle and
equipment storage facilities; emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during and after a flood; public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood; and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   "D ZONE." An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   "DEVELOPMENT." Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,

in the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   "ENCLOSURE." That portion of a structure below the base flood elevation
(BFE) used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the
structure.
   "ENCROACHMENT." The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth,
fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a
floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   "EXISTING CONSTRUCTION." Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMs effective before that date. "EXISTING CONSTRUCTION" may also be referred
to as "existing structures".
   "EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION." A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by Munfordville based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   "EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION." The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   "FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD." The flood that has a 0.2% chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to
low risk of flooding.
   "FLOOD, FLOODING, OR FLOOD WATER."
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e. mudflows). See "MUDSLIDES".
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See "FLOOD-
RELATED EROSION".
   "FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM)." A map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   "FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM)." A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   "FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)." A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   "FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY." The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing

community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   "FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT." The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   "FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS." This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   "FLOOD PROOFING." Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation
facilities, structures, and their contents.
   "FLOOD PROOFING CERTIFICATE." A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   "FLOODWAY." The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the "regulatory floodway".
   "FLOODWAY FRINGE." That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   "FREEBOARD." A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or flood proofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
   "FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION." As related in §
151.38, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100
years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   "FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY." A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   "GOVERNING BODY." The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   "HAZARD POTENTIAL." The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   "HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE." The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   "HISTORIC STRUCTURE." Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior, or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   "INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC)." Increased cost of compliance coverage
provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with state or
community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss
by flood. When a building covered by a standard flood insurance policy under
the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares the building to be
substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the
cost to elevate, flood-proof, demolish, or remove the building. ICC coverage is
available on residential and non-residential buildings (this category includes
public or government buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal
buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   "KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE 151.250 — PLANS FOR DAMS, LEVEES, ETC. TO BE
APPROVED AND PERMIT ISSUED BY CABINET — (ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC PROTECTION
CABINET)."
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to require
approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this definition is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.
   "LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC)." An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMC's include the following
categories:
      (1)   "LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA)." A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A
LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property
is not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   "LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR)." A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   "LETTER OF MAP REVISION – FILL (LOMR-F)." A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   "LEVEE." A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   "LEVEE SYSTEM." A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met:
      (1)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
      (2)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state
agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community
participating in the NFIP.
   "LIMITED STORAGE." An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   "LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE." The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support,
or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion
of construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or
landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure's foundation
system.
   "LOWEST FLOOR." The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   "MANUFACTURED HOME." A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or
without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required
utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar
transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
and intended to be improved property. The term "MANUFACTURED HOME" does not
include a recreational vehicle (see "RECREATIONAL VEHICLE").
   "MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION." A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

§ 151.21 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
151.04, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower
than at or above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with
standards of division (C) of this section.
      (1)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated at or above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states
as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: The
applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and
thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA
maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent
significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of
the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire
base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by
the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not
occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site
elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory
floodway boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated at or above the base flood elevation.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor
including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection department to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be flood-proofed below an elevation at or above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than at or above the level of the base flood
elevation; or
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in division (A) of this section.
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) of this
section.
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation at or above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood
elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to
allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and,
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions;
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and,
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed

            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result
of a flood.
         (b)   All manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than at or above the
level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than at or above the level of the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.

licensed and insured in accordance with the state motor vehicle regulations, is
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
   (E)   Floodways.
      (1)   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
151.04 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply.
      (2)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge.
      (3)   If this division is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.

151.04 are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in zone AO the flood depth specified
on the flood insurance rate map above the highest adjacent grade. In zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in zone AO the flood depth specified on the
flood insurance rate map, above the highest adjacent grade. In zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely flood proofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
151.21(B).

151.99
§ 151.24 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available
(zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is
the lesser, shall be provided.
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood
elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.

151.99
§ 151.25 STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE
LETTER 'A'.
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated 'A'
the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Structure must be non-habitable;
   (B)   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;
   (C)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one foot above grade,
total openings are to be one square inch per one square foot of floor area, at
least two openings required on opposite walls;
   (D)   Built of flood resistant materials below a level at or above the base
flood elevation;
   (E)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;
   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking; and
   (G)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.

151.99
§ 151.26 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of the base flood
elevation at the site. Flood proofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 151.35 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Council hereby appoints the Mayor and/or their designee to
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting
or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein
referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 005-08, passed 6-2-08)
§ 151.36 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
151.04.   Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by the Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed.
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§
151.21(B) and 151.23(B).
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
(Ord. 005-08, passed 6-2-08)
§ 151.37 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed,
authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of
this chapter. The Floodplain Administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this chapter, which are consistent with its spirit and
purpose by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its
provisions.
   (B)   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include, but not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Permit review. Review all development permits to ensure that:
         (a)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
         (b)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained.
Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been

federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;
         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner; and
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely
affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
151.04, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer §§
151.20 through
151.25. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for
adoption.
      (3)   Notification of other agencies:
         (a)   Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division of Water, and
any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse;
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and
         (c)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      (4)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
         (a)   Certification required by §
151.21(A) (lowest floor elevations) as shown on a completed and certified
elevation certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to
mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or
substantially improved structures, in accordance with §
151.36;
         (b)   Certification required by §
151.21(B) (elevation or flood proofing of nonresidential structures) as shown
on a completed and certified flood proofing certificate. Verify and record the
actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or
substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed, in accordance with §
151.36(B);
         (c)   Certification required by §
151.21(C) (elevated structures);
         (d)   Certification of elevation required by §
151.24(A) (subdivision standards);
         (e)   Certification required by §
151.51(E) (floodway encroachments);
         (f)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
not diminished;
         (g)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance;
         (h)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this
chapter as specified in §
151.99.
      (5)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
151.38(C).
         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
151.04, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
151.20 through
151.25.
         (c)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
151.21(B), a flood-proofing certificate.
         (d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall
be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be open
for public inspection.
      (6)   Right of entry.
         (a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the Administrator has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any
condition or violation which makes such building, structure or premises unsafe,
dangerous or hazardous, the Administrator may enter such building, structure or
premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or perform any duty
imposed upon the Administrator by this chapter.
         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, he or she shall
first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building,
structure, or premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort
to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such request
entry.
         (c)   If entry is refused, the Administrator shall have recourse to
every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
         (d)   When the Administrator shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or
occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building,
structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the Administrator for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter.
      (7)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the Administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the person
doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.
      (8)   Revocation of permits.
         (a)   The Administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued under
the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false statement or
misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or plans on which
the permit or approval was based.
         (b)   The Administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by the
Administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this chapter.
      (9)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the Floodplain
Administrator's staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his duties, shall not
thereby render himself personally liable, and is hereby relieved from all
personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a
result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties. Any
suit brought against any officer, employee, or member because of such act
performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this chapter
shall be defended by the Department of Law until the final termination of the
proceedings.
      (10)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A floodplain
construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced construction
within 180 calendar days from the date of its issuance by the Floodplain
Administrator.

§ 151.38 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The City Council shall
establish an Appeal Board consisting of the Board of Adjustments.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local district court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
151.02 under "PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE"), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in §
151.02) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of division (D) of this
section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage.
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Munfordville Recorder and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition in §
151.02) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

§ 151.39 CIVIL OFFENSE.
   If, at any time, development occurs which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications,
such development shall constitute a civil offense.
(Ord. 005-08, passed 6-2-08)
§ 151.40 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or agent of the Floodplain
Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a person has caused
development to occur which is not in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and conditions of a
floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications thereof, a duly
authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a notice to the
person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner, stating the
facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/or of the
permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be remedied to bring
the development into conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit,
and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which period of time
shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the violation and
whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may include an order
to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state that a citation
may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and corrective
actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary fine and
shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See §
151.99.
(Ord. 005-08, passed 6-2-08)
§ 151.41 NOTICE OF CITATION.
   If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or agent of the Floodplain
Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a person has caused
development to occur which is not in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and conditions of a
floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications thereof, a duly
authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a citation to the
offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation issued, how the
violation is to be remedied to bring the development into conformity with this
chapter or with the approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy
is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are recommended. When a citation is
issued, the person to whom the citation is issued shall respond to the citation
within seven days of the date the citation is issued by either carrying out the
remedies and corrections set forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set
forth in the citation or requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the
person to whom the citation is issued does not respond to the citation within
seven days, that person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing
and the determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
(Ord. 005-08, passed 6-2-08)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no less than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than 15 days, or both, and
in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day
such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
