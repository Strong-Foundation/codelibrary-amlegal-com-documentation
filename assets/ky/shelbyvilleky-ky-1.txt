§ 24.103 BIDDER'S LIST; VENDOR PREQUALIFICATION
   (A)   Any person, firm, or corporation desiring to receive written notice of
procurement requirements of the city may make application to have his name
placed on a bidder's list for the types or kinds of goods or services he wishes
to supply or provide. The city may specify the form to be used and the
procedure to be followed by the prospective vendor to make application for
inclusion on the bidder's lists.
   (B)   The city may establish a program for vendor prequalification. To
establish a program for vendor prequalification, the city shall solicit from
each prospective vendor sufficient information to permit evaluation of vendors
qualifications in terms of the following:
      (1)   The ability and capacity to perform on a timely basis under
contract for goods or services he wishes to bid on and supply.
      (2)   Good character, integrity, reputation, and experience.
      (3)   Satisfactory performance in prior dealings with the city.
      (4)   Satisfactory performance in dealings with other local government
units, the state, and other state governments.
   (C)   The city may refuse to list any prospective vendor if that vendor does
not meet the minimum requirements established for entry on a bidder's list. It
is the responsibility of the vendor to show that he meets established
qualifications for entry on the bidder's list to which he seeks to gain entry.
      (1)   The prospective vendor will be promptly notified if his application
is disapproved and the reason for disapproval shall be stated.
      (2)   A prospective bidder may appeal the disapproval of his application
to the city. The appeal must be filed within two (2) weeks after the date of
the notice of disapproval, and must state the grounds for the appeal with
reasonable particularity and must relate directly to the reason for disapproval
of the application.
      (3)   The city may establish the time at which and the conditions under
which a vendor whose application has been disapproved may reapply for placement
on a bidder's list.
   (D)   A bid may be accepted from a bidder who has not prequalified, provided
that the bidder submits all information required by the city to make a
determination of the bidder's qualifications prior to award of the contract.

§ 24.104 SEALED BIDS
   All contracts and purchases shall be awarded by competitive sealed bidding
as follows, unless otherwise provided in this chapter.
   (A)   Advertising.
      (1)   All sealed bids shall be advertised not less than seven (7) nor
more than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date set for the opening of bids.
The invitation for bids shall state whether the award shall be made on the
basis of the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated bid price. If the latter
is used, the objective measurable criteria to be utilized shall be set forth in
the invitation for bids.
      (2)   The advertisement shall include the time and place the bids will be
opened and where the specifications may be obtained.
      (3)   Advertisements shall be entered in the newspaper with the largest
circulation within the jurisdiction area of the city.
      (4)   The advertisement for bids may be placed in other publications
when, in the judgment of the city, such advertisement would best secure the
interests of the city.
      (5)   If it is determined during the advertising period that additional
time should be allowed for the preparation of bids, the bid opening date may be
extended by the following methods:
         (a)   Placing a legal notice, specifying the revised bid date in the
local newspaper with the largest circulation. The revised bid opening date
shall be not less than seven (7) nor more than twenty-one (21) days after the
appearance of the legal notice.
         (b)   Issuing an addendum to the invitation for bids. This addendum
shall be in writing, must be mailed or delivered to all holders of the
invitation for bids, and must be acknowledged on the form of proposal by each
bidder submitting a bid.
      (6)   Extensions of the bid opening date may be permitted under the
following circumstances:
         (a)   Changes are made in specifications after advertisement.
         (b)   One or more bidders notify the city of discrepancies, errors, or
areas requiring clarification in the specifications.
         (c)   Specifications require design work on the part of the bidders,
and when unforeseen conditions make completion of bid preparation prior to the
bid deadline impossible.
         (d)   Strikes, disasters, or other uncontrollable factors prevent
bidders from acquiring information necessary for bid preparation.
         (e)   Other reasons as may be determined by the city.
      (7)   An invitation for bids may be rescinded under the following
circumstances:
         (a)   Conditions leading to issuance of an invitation for bids change
sufficiently to make the proposed purchase unnecessary.
         (b)   Funds for the proposed purchase become unavailable.
         (c)   It becomes apparent that no bids will be received because the
item or service requested is currently unavailable; the bid price will
apparently exceed available funds; or major revisions in the specifications are
necessary to ensure that responsive and responsible bids are received.
   (B)   Specifications and standard specifications. As set forth in KRS
45A.415, the city shall use specifications which assure the maximum practicable
competition to meet the city's needs. A specification which describes a product
which is proprietary to one company may be used only when no other kind of
specification is reasonably available to describe requirements; and such
specification includes language which specifically permits an equivalent
product to be supplied. Such specification shall include a description of the
salient characteristics of the product.
      (1)   All specifications used in the procurement process shall be
designed to provide the maximum practicable competition consistent with the
level of quality required. All specifications shall be in a standard format
established by the city. Specifications shall be as open and accurate as
conditions permit. Any restrictive element shall require written justification
by the using agency. The appropriate type of specification, as described below,
shall be used for each purchase:
         (a)   Design specifications prescribe how an item is to be
manufactured or built. This type of specification is particularly suitable for
construction projects.
         (b)   Performance specifications describe the capabilities of the item
to be purchased. Criteria are developed to measure the ability of the item to
be purchased to perform or last.
         (c)   A combination of design and performance specifications may be
used when appropriate.
         (d)   Brand name or equivalent specifications may be used only when
other types of specifications are inappropriate or unavailable. If brand name
or equivalent specifications are used, the specification must specify more than
one (1) brand name if possible; specifically state that any equivalent product
may be supplied, with the burden of proof of equivalency being on the proposing
vendor; and must set forth all salient criteria to be met by all products
proposed.
      (2)   The city may, when appropriate for the anticipated procurement,
establish a qualified products list and may use this list in place of detailed
specifications.
         (a)   The city shall establish the criteria to be met by any product
proposed for inclusion on a qualified products list, and shall make those
criteria available to the public and to interested vendors.
         (b)   A bidder may, in response to an invitation for bids issued on
the basis of a qualified products list, propose to furnish a product not
included on the qualified products list if he demonstrates, prior to the award
of the contract and to the satisfaction of the city, that the product proposed
meets all criteria established for inclusion on the qualified products list.
   (C)   Use of forms. All bids shall be submitted on forms provided by the
city. Bids submitted on other forms may be rejected as nonresponsive. Bid forms
shall not be altered in any manner. If there are acceptable exceptions, they
shall be listed and noted on a separate sheet and shall be attached to the bid
form. Each exception noted shall state the increase or decrease in the total
cost of the commodity or service to be furnished.
   (D)   Use of bid price or evaluated bid price. A bid shall be awarded to the
responsible bidder who submits the responsive bid for the lowest bid price or
lowest evaluated price.
      (1)   If the bid is to be awarded on the basis of lowest bid price, the
method of award shall be clearly stated in the invitation for bids.
      (2)   If the bid is to be awarded on the basis of lowest evaluated bid
price, the evaluation criteria to be used, along with applicable formulas or
computation methods, shall be clearly stated in the invitation for bids.
   (E)   Withdrawal of bids. No bid, once submitted, may be withdrawn before
the time allowed for acceptance stated in the invitation for bids has elapsed
unless the following circumstances occur. Any bid withdrawal, except under the
following circumstances, shall require forfeiture of bid security.
      (1)   Bids have not been opened and a written request is received from a
bidder for withdrawal of his bid more than twenty-four (24) hours before the
date and time set for opening.
      (2)   An error has been made that is obvious on the face of the bid (e.g.
error in extensions, arithmetical errors, and the like).
      (3)   The bidder can demonstrate from worksheets or other documents that
an error has been made in preparation of the bid documents.
      (4)   Request for withdrawal of a bid is made in writing to the city
clearly stating the reason for the request for withdrawal.
   (F)   Waiver of requirements. The city may waive any informalities and may
establish conditions under which any incomplete bids may be considered if it is
determined that the waiver is in the best interests of the city.
   (G)   Opening time for bids.
      (1)   An opening time for each bid shall be stated in the advertisement
and invitations for bids.
      (2)   It shall be the bidder's responsibility to assure that his bid is
in the office before the time set for receipt of bids.
      (3)   The city shall, at the time set for opening bids, publicly open all
bids submitted. If the structure of the invitation for bids permits, all bids
submitted shall be read aloud.
      (4)   Bids shall not be examined, inspected, or reviewed by persons
present at the opening until all bids have been opened.
      (5)   The city shall, with reasonable promptness, prepare a tabulation of
all bids received in response to an invitation for bids, together with the
names of the bidders. This information shall be made available to the public
upon reasonable request.
   (H)   Evaluation and awards.
      (1)   After the bids are opened, the city shall review all bids for
compliance with specifications, terms, and conditions.
      (2)   Every bidder, when requested by the city, shall clarify or explain
in writing, any matter contained in his bid which the city determines needs
clarification or explanation. The bid of any bidder who fails to provide this
written clarification or explanation of his bid when the clarification or
explanation is requested shall not be considered for award. The written
clarification or explanation of a bid shall be incorporated in and become part
of any contract awarded on the basis of that bid.
      (3)   Alternate bids will be considered for award only if the invitation
of bids specifically requests that alternates be submitted and establishes
conditions under which alternate bids will be considered for award.
      (4)   After evaluation, a contract shall be awarded with reasonable
promptness to the responsive bidder whose bid (or alternate bid, if alternates
are requested in the invitation for bids) is either the lowest bid price or the
lowest evaluated bid price, as designated in the invitation for bids as the
basis for award of the contract.
      (5)   If the city determines, in writing, that no satisfactory bid has
been received, all bids may be rejected and new bids may be invited on the
basis of the same or revised specifications, or competitive negotiations may be
undertaken for the procurement. The basis for rejection of all bids and
subsequent action taken with respect to the invitation for bids shall be
recorded in writing and filed in the bid file relating to the particular
procurement. The city reserves the right to hold all bids for a period of
thirty (30) days.
   (I)   Rejection of bids. The city reserves the right to reject any and all
bids and to waive informalities and minor irregularities in the bids. Grounds
for rejection include, but shall not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Failure of a bid to conform to the essential requirements of an
invitation for bids.
      (2)   Failure to conform to specifications contained in or referred to in

the invitation for bids.
      (3)   Failure to conform to a delivery schedule established in the
invitation for bids.
      (4)   Imposition of conditions which would modify the terms and
conditions of the invitation for bids, or which would limit the bidder's
liability to the city under terms of the contract awarded on the basis of the
invitation for bids.
      (5)   Failure of a bid to be reasonable in price.
      (6)   Failure of a bid to be responsible, as set forth in KRS 45A.395.
      (7)   Failure to furnish a bid guarantee when the guarantee is required
by an invitation for bids.
   (J)   Bid conditions.
      (1)   The city may adapt and revise as necessary, general conditions for
bidding. The general conditions for bidding shall be applicable to, included
in, or incorporated by reference in all invitations for bids issued by the
city.
      (2)   The city may, as required by a particular procurement, develop and
adapt special bid conditions supplemental to the general bid conditions.
      (3)   Any bidder who submits a bid in response to an invitation for bids
shall be deemed to have agreed to comply with all terms, conditions, and
specifications of the invitation for bids.
      (4)   Where, after invitation for bid has been made in accordance with
KRS 45A.365 and no bids have been received from responsive and responsible
bidders, the city may proceed to acquire the supplies, services, or
construction by noncompetitive negotiations in accordance with KRS 45A.380.
   (K)   Contract pricing. The following matters shall be applicable to all
invitations for bids issued, bids submitted, and contracts awarded for the
purchase of commodities, supplies, and equipment pursuant to KRS 45A.365 and
this regulation:
      (1)   Discounts shall not be considered unless stated in the invitation
for bids.
      (2)   In case of discrepancy in the extension of a price, the unit price
shall govern over the total price for all items.

to be in the best interest of the city. The methods and basis of evaluation of
bids and award of contract shall be stated in the invitation for bids.
   (L)   Cancellation. As set forth in KRS 45A.390, an invitation for bid or a
request for a proposal or other solicitation may be canceled, or all bids or
proposals may be rejected, if it is determined in writing that such action is
in the best interest of the city.

exceed $100,000. Bidder's security shall be a bond provided by a surety company

percent (5%) of the amount of the bid.

may set forth by regulation exceptions to this requirement in the event of
substantial compliance.
         (d)   After the bids are opened, they shall be irrevocable for the
period specified in the invitation for bids. However, if a bidder is permitted

            1.   A performance bond satisfactory to the city executed by a
surety company authorized to do business in this state, or otherwise supplied,
satisfactory to the city, in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
the contract price as it may be increased; and
            2.   A payment bond satisfactory to the city, executed by a surety
company authorized to do business in this state, or otherwise supplied,

material to the contractor or his subcontractors for the performance of the
work provided for in the contract. The bond shall be in an amount equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the original contract price.
         (b)   Nothing in this division shall be construed to limit the
authority of the city to require a performance bond or other security in
addition to those bonds, or in circumstances other than as specified in
division (2)(a) above, including, but not limited to bonds for the payment of
taxes and unemployment insurance premiums.
(KRS 45A.435)
      (3)   Bond forms, filings, and copies.

who requests such and pays the reasonable fee for such copy. The copy shall be
prima facie evidence of the contents, execution, and delivery of the original.

price is expected to exceed $50,000, or such lesser amount as may be prescribed
by the city; or
         (b)   Pricing of any change order or contract modification which is
expected to exceed $25,000, or such lesser amount as may be prescribed by the

contractor shall have the burden of establishing the amount of compensation to
which he believes himself to be entitled by the submission of complete and

§ 27.002 FINDINGS; PURPOSE; AUTHORITY
   (A)   Findings. The City Council of the city finds and declares that:
      (1)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
      (2)   The vitality and stability of the government of this city depends
upon the public's confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed
officers and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the
private interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that
confidence is imperiled.
      (3)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
   (B)   Purpose.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring
that standards of ethical and financial disclosure requirements for officers
and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in their
application, and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
      (2)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements
of KRS 65.003, as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   Authority. This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city
by KRS 82.0823 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

within the city limits for the collection of garbage. The city also adopts
services for the collection of recyclable materials within this article.
   (B)   The franchise holder shall be required to provide pickup service for
regular residential and commercial garbage at each home or establishment one
(1) time each week. The franchise holder shall be required to provide pickup
service for non-standard or bulk items, including large appliances and
furniture, at least once a month as determined by the franchise holder. The

containers, the commercial customer shall have the right to refuse the garbage
collection services of the franchise holder. Under such circumstances, the

franchise, with the franchise holder being given preference if feasible.

for herein, the franchise holder shall pay the agency an administrative fee
based on the terms and provisions negotiated in a contract with the franchise

responsible for collecting such fees.

garbage collection services on all containers and dumpsters located at city
owned or leased properties. The franchise holder shall further provide each

wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the
system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludge from the system; and
      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits
to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements
for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires
user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to the city and to persons outside the city

the acceptability, the Commission shall give consideration to such factors as
the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the
sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater
treatment plant, and other pertinent factors, such as phosphorous removal to
meet discharge limitations. The limitations or restrictions on materials or
characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer shall
not be violated without written approval of the Commission.
      (1)   Any water or waste which has characteristics based on a 24-hour
composite sample, or a shorter period composite sample if more representative
which exceed the following normal maximum domestic wastewater parameter
concentrations:
      Parameter   Maximum Allowable Concentration Without Surcharge
      BOD                  250 mg/l
      TSS                  250 mg/l
      NH3-N               25 mg/l

      Zinc                     1.50
      (3)   Where an effluent from an industrial process is mixed prior to
treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process,
fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge permit by
the Manager. These alternative limits may be calculated using the Combined
Wastestream Formula and/or Flow-weighted Average Formula set out in 40 CFR
403.6(a). Where the effluent limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production
(production-based standard), the Manager may convert the limits to equivalent
limitations expressed either in mass of pollutant that may be discharged per
day or of effluent concentrations for purposes of calculating effluent permit
limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be subject to all
permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully
comply with these alternative limits. All categorical industrial users subject
to production-based standards must report production rates annually so that
alternative permit limits can be calculated if necessary. The categorical
industrial user must notify the Manager thirty (30) days in advance of any
change in production levels that might affect the flow or other data used to
calculate the effluent limits in the discharge permit.

schedule established by the Commission and approved by the city.
      (3)   It shall be illegal to discharge any batch liquid waste into any
manhole or other part of the public sewer system, or any building sewer or
other facility that discharges to the public sewer system, except at designated
points of discharge specified by the Manager for those purposes.
      (4)   Any liquid waste hauler caught illegally discharging to the public
sewer system shall be subject to immediate revocation of discharge privileges
(if granted) and further subject to the penalties prescribed in §
31.999.
      (5)   Nothing in this chapter shall relieve waste haulers of the
responsibility for compliance with County Health Department, state or federal
regulations.
   (D)   Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.
      (1)   An Industrial User may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this section.
      (2)   Notice.
         (a)   If an Industrial User knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Control Authority, if possible, at least
ten (10) days before the date of the bypass.
         (b)   An Industrial User shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards to the Control Authority
within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the Industrial User becomes aware
of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days
of the time the Industrial User becomes aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times; and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of bypass. The
Control Authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the
oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
      (3)   Prohibition of bypass.
         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Control Authority may take
enforcement action against an Industrial User for a bypass unless:
            (i)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            (ii)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
            (iii)   The Industrial User submitted notices as required under
paragraph (a) of this section.
         (b)   The Control Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Control Authority determines that it
will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (3)(a) of this section.
   (E)   No statement contained in this subchapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment provided applicable local, state, and
federal pretreatment regulations of the city's NPDES/KPDES permit are not
violated.

§ 31.064 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG DISCHARGE CONTROL PLANS
   (A)   The Manager and/or Director of Wastewater Operations shall evaluate
whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or
other action to control slug discharges. The Manager and/or the Director of
Wastewater Operations may require any User to develop, submit for approval, and
implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to
control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Manager and/or the Director of
Wastewater Operations may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug control discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Manager and/or the
Director of Wastewater Operations of any accidental or slug discharge, as
required by this section, subsection (B) below; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training building of
containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (B)   Each significant user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this
chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Water and Sewer Commission for review, and
shall be approved by the Commission before construction of the facility. All
existing users shall complete this plan within ninety (90) days after the

hundred eighty (180) days of approval of plans and notification by the Manager.
No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this
chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until
accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from
the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the
responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the
incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
   (C)   Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental
discharge, the user shall submit to the Commission a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrence. This notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as
a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall this notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this subchapter or other
applicable law.
   (D)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all

management Practice (BMP) or pollution alternative, the User must submit
documentation required by the Manager and/or Director of Wastewater Operations
or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of
the User.. At the discretion of the Commission and in consideration of those
factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, and the like,
the Commission may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are
to be submitted.
      (2)   Significant Industrial Users must notify the Manager and/or
Director of Wastewater Operations violations of restricted discharge
limitations within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violations.
The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to Manager and/or Director of Wastewater Operations within
thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation(s). If the Commission
performed the sampling analysis in lieu of the Industrial user, the Commission
may perform the repeat sampling and analysis. In this case, resampling by the
Industrial User is not required if the Commission performs sampling at the
User’s facility at least once a month, or if the Commission performs sampling
at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the
time when the User and the Commission receives the result of this sampling, or
if the Commission has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
Industrial User. The Commission may notify the Industrial User of the violation
and require the Industrial User to start demand monitoring in accordance with §
31.137. If the Commission performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
Industrial user, the Commission shall perform the repeat sampling and analysis
unless it notifies the User of the violation and requires the user to perform
the repeat sampling and analysis. Any discharges of prohibited discharges shall
be reported immediately in accordance with §
31.060.
      (3)   Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Manager
and/or Director of Wastewater Operations immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
   (B)   The Commission may impose mass limitations on users where their
imposition is appropriate. In those cases, the report required by subsection
(A) above shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment
standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature
and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Commission of
pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment
standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable
pretreatment standard. All analyses shall be performed by a laboratory
acceptable to the Commission. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with
procedures established by the U.S. EPA Administrator pursuant to Section 304(g)
of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any
other test procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator. Sampling shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the U.S. EPA
Administrator.
   (C)   Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication,
"Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants," April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
   (D)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the User’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim the sampling results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.

§ 31.088 MONITORING FACILITIES
   (A)   The Water and Sewer Commission shall require significant users to
provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal
drainage system. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the
user's premises, but the Commission may, when that location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in a public right-of-way. The Manager shall review and approve the
location, plans, and specifications for all monitoring facilities and may
require them to be constructed to provide for the separate monitoring and
sampling of industrial waste and sanitary sewage flows.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near the sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the Commission's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days
following approval of the location, plans, and specifications.
   (D)   Significant Industrial Users shall receive prior approval from the
Manager prior to making a change in a monitoring location.
(Ord. - -, passed 6-7-84, Am. Ord. 91-07-18, passed 7-18-91)
§ 31.089 INSPECTION, SAMPLING AND RECORDKEEPING
   (A)   The Water and Sewer Commission shall inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Commission or its
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, copying records, records
examination, or in the performance of any of their duties.
   (B)   Any industrial user or user subject to the reporting requirements
established in this section shall be required to retain for a minimum of three
(3) years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such
monitoring activities are required by this section). This period of retention
shall be extended during the course of any unsolved litigation regarding the
industrial user or POTW, or other state or federal enforcement agency.
   (C)   The Commission, approval authority, and EPA shall have the right to
set up on the user's property those devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling inspection, compliance monitoring, or metering operations. Where a
user has security measures in force which would require proper identification
and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements for their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the Commission, approval authority, and EPA will
be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
   (D)   Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements
must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis
performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The
Commission shall indicate the frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and
assure compliance by the user with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements, as found in the User’s Wastewater Contribution permit, or through
required demand monitoring, if necessary.
      (1)   Except as indicates in subsection (D)(2) and (D)(3) below, the User
must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the Manager, or Director of Wastewater
Operations. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Commission, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, and when approved, multiple grab
samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the composting procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Commission
as appropriate. In addition, grab sample may be required to show compliance
with instantaneous limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, Cyanide, Total
Phenols, Sulfides, and Volatile Organic Compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety
(90) day compliance reports required under §
31.081 (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, the Manager, or Director of Wastewater Operations may authorize a
lower minimum. For the reports required by §
31.087 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (E)   Date of receipts of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed
postage prepaid into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (F)   Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under §
31.087(A). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. this period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User
or the Commission, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Manager, or Director of Wastewater Operations.
   (G)   Certification of permit applications user reports and initial
monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required to be
submitted by Users submitting permit applications, Users submitting baseline
monitoring reports, Users submitting compliance reports with the catagorical
pretreatment standard deadlines, Users submitting periodic compliance reports,
and Users submitting an initial request to forego sampling of a pollutant. The
following certification statement must be signed by an authorized
representative:
      I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my supervision in accordance with a system designed to
assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and
complete. I am aware that here are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing
violations.

hearing to contest the notice of additional monitoring.
   (B)   The person or user of whom the demand monitoring is required may
request a hearing before the Commission to contest the requirement to conduct
additional monitoring. If a hearing is not requested within twenty (20) days of
the date of Notice of Violation or Administrative Order, the person or user to
whom the Notice of Violation or Administrative Order was directed shall be
deemed to have waived the right to a hearing. If, following a hearing, the
person or user who was directed by the Manager or his or her designee to
conduct additional monitoring is not found to be in violation of this chapter
or any permit or order issued hereunder, then the Commission shall reimburse
the person or user for the laboratory costs of sampling or testing incurred as
a result of any additional monitoring carried out pursuant to the Notice of
Violation or Administrative Order that was the subject to the hearing.
   (C)   Notwithstanding a person or a user's request for a hearing pursuant to
this section, if a Notice of Violation includes a requirement of demand
monitoring, the user must begin demand monitoring within the time requirements

§ 31.138 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS AND REMEDIES
   (A)   The Manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar agreements with an industrial user responsible for
noncompliance to ensure a return to compliance. Such orders will include
specific actions to be taken by the user to abate the noncompliance within a
specified time period. Such orders may also stipulate damages or administrative
fines to be paid by the user.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Manager from taking
immediate action to remedy any violation of this chapter when there is reason
to believe that the existence of a violation presents a serious threat to the
public health, safety, and welfare, or if in the absence of immediate action,
the effects of the violation will be irreparable or irreversible. The Manager
also may order any industrial user which causes or contributes to a violation
of this chapter, or of a permit or order hereunder, to appear at a meeting to
show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of
any such meeting will be served personally or by certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days before the date of the meeting. Such notice
may be served on any user or on its authorized agent. Whether or not a duly
notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
   (C)   Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, whenever the Manager
finds that any person is causing, engaging in or maintaining a condition or
activity which, in its judgment presents a danger to the health or welfare of
the public, the POTW facilities, or the environment, or will cause interference
with the POTW or cause the Commission to violate any condition of its KPDES,
the Manager may, without prior hearing, order such person, in writing, to
discontinue, abate or alleviate such condition or activity, and thereupon such
person shall immediately discontinue, abate or alleviate such condition or
activity. As soon as reasonably possible thereafter, the Commission shall
provide the person an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence that such
condition or activity does not violate the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2001-12-06, passed 12-6-01)
§ 31.139 CONTINUING VIOLATION
   Any person who willfully continues any violation beyond the time limit
provided for shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter, and upon
conviction thereof, shall be fined in accordance with §
31.999. Each day in which a violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate
offense. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the Water and Sewer
Commission may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court report's
fees, and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the
person found to have violated this chapter or the orders, rules, regulations,
and permits issued hereunder.
(Ord. - -, passed 6-7-84)
§ 31.140 SUSPENSION, MODIFICATION OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT
   (A)   Any user who violates any of the following, or violates the conditions
of this chapter or application state or federal regulations, or a permit or
order issued hereunder, is subject to having its permit suspended, modified, or
revoked in accordance with the procedures of this chapter:
      (1)   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of his discharge;
      (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Other good cause.
   (B)   The Commission may also suspend, modify or revoke the wastewater
treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit of a user after
appropriate notice whenever such action is necessary in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of the public, the POTW facilities, or
the environment, or presenting or causing interference with the POTW or the
Commission to violate any condition of its KPDES. Any user notified of a
suspension or revocation of service or of its permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate its contribution. In the event that the user fails to immediately
comply with the suspension, modification or revocation order, the Commission
shall take such steps as necessary, including immediate severance of the
property service connection, to prevent or minimize the damage to the receiving
waters, the POTW facilities, or public health. The Commission may allow the
user to recommence discharge and/or service may recommence, at user's expense,
after the endangerment has passed and the user has satisfactorily demonstrated
consistent compliance. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of any harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Commission within
fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence.
   (C)   An existing permit, which is being renewed in the ordinary course of
business, may be amended, modified, suspended or revoked or additional
requirements or limitations may be placed upon the permit holder, but only
after the holder of the permit, and all other interested parties, have been
given thirty (30) days notice of the Commission's intent to do so. The Manager
of the Commission or his or her designee shall respond to reasonable requests
for information from users regarding the reason(s) for a modification of an
existing permit.
   (D)   The user may request, in writing, a hearing before the Commission to
contest the suspension, modification, or revocation of an existing permit
within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice of such action, and the
Commission shall schedule a hearing upon appropriate request. Not less than ten
(10) days before the date set for the hearing, the Commission shall notify the
person who requested the hearing of the date, time and place of the hearing.
The notice may be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
personal delivery.
   (E)   At the hearing, the Commission shall determine, based on the evidence
presented, whether the decision to suspend, modify or revoke the permit is
supported by the evidence, and shall issue an order accordingly. The Commission
shall accept testimony from the Manager or an authorized representative, and
the industrial user or an authorized representative, and any witness offered by
the Manager or the industrial user. All testimony shall be under oath and shall
be recorded. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due
process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. Any final order of
the Commission shall be reduced in writing, which shall include the date the
order was issued, and a copy of the order shall be furnished to the person
named in the permit. If the person named in the permit is not present at the
time the final order of the Commission is issued, the order shall be delivered
to the person by certified, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery.
The Commission's final order shall be deemed a final agency action.
(Ord. - -, passed 6-7-84; Am. Ord. 2001-12-06, passed 12-6-01)
§ 31.141 CONDUCT OF HEARINGS
   (A)   The Commission shall preside over all hearings hereunder and shall
regulate the course of the proceedings in a manner which will promote the
orderly and prompt conduct of the hearing.
   (B)   The Commission shall afford all parties the opportunity to respond,
present evidence and argument, conduct cross-examination, and submit rebuttal
evidence.
   (C)   Any party to a hearing may participate in person or be represented by

   (E)   Any party shall have the right to inspect, at least five (5) days
prior to the hearing, a list of all witnesses the other party expects to call
at the hearing, and the available documentary or tangible evidence relating to
a hearing either in person or by counsel.
   (F)   At the hearing, the formal rules of evidence need not be observed
provided that all evidence shall be of the type of evidence on which reasonable
and prudent persons would rely in their daily affairs, and in any event does
not deprive a party of due process of law.
   (G)   All hearings, evidence, testimony and pleadings before the Commission
shall be subject to both the Kentucky Open Records Act and the Kentucky Open
Meetings Act, including the confidentiality provisions of both Acts.
   (H)   At the hearing, the burden of proof and of going forward shall be on
the party proposing to impose fines or other sanctions, to require remedial
action, or to amend, modify, revoke, or suspend any existing permit or permit
which is being renewed. The burden of persuasion shall be by a preponderance of
the evidence. Proof that any amendment, modification, suspension or revocation
of any existing permit or permit that is being renewed is expressly required by
any federal or state statute or regulation to which the Commission or the
Commission's activities are subject shall meet the burden of proof.

Division 11. Rates and Charges
§ 31.300 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SEWER SERVICE CHARGES
   (A)   Sewer service charges shall be charges levied on all users who
discharge, cause or permit the discharge of sewage into the public sewage
treatment system. Rates or charges for sewer service shall be based upon the
quantity of water measured by the water meter supplied to the respective
building or premises.
   (B)   Sewer service charges shall be comprised of a system of user charges,
excessive strength surcharges, a system of charges for debt service and may
include return on investment.
   (C)   User charges shall mean charges levied on users of the sewage system
to offset the cost of operations and maintenance of the system including simple
replacement costs.
   (D)   Excessive strength surcharges mean charges levied on users of the
sewage treatment system whose contributions contain conventional pollutants in
concentrations which exceed the limits specified herein for such pollutants and
who are permitted to make such contributions to the system by decision of the
Municipal Water and Sewer Commission. In the event that the Commission shall
permit a user to discharge waste to the sewage works having an average
biochemical demand (BOD5) in excess of 250 mg/l, and/or an average suspended
solids (TSS) content in excess of 250 mg/l, and/or an average ammonia nitrogen
(NH3 -N) content in excess of 25 mg/l, the user shall pay a surcharge based
upon the excess strength of its wastes.
   (E)   Charges for debt service shall mean charges levied on users of the
sewage treatment system to support the annual debt service obligations of the
system.
   (F)   No reduction in sewage service charges, fees, or taxes shall be
permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the sewage
works contain less than the 250 mg/l of BOD5, 250 mg/l of TSS, or 25 mg/l NH3-
N.
   (G)   The Commission shall review not less than every two (2) years the
sewage contribution of users, and the total cost of operation and maintenance
of the sewage works, and user charges. Based on such a review, the Commission
shall recommend to the city, when necessary, a revised schedule of user charges
which shall accomplish the following:
      (1)   Maintain the proportionate distribution of operations and
maintenance costs among users of the treatment system.
      (2)   Generate sufficient revenues to offset the costs associated with
the proper operation and maintenance of the system, including depreciation
expense (through renewal and replacement costs) and transfers.
      (3)   Generate sufficient revenues to support the annual debt service of
the system.
      (4)   Review excessive strength surcharges every two (2) years.

§ 31.302 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGES (SDC) AND SEWER TAP ON FEES
   (A)   Purpose and policy. 
      (1)   This section sets forth uniform requirements for financing capital
improvements to the water and sewer systems to serve growth and at the same
time prevent or reduce the inequity to existing customers that would result
when the existing customers must pay for the increases in water or sewer rates
that are needed to pay for added plant costs for new customers.
      (2)   The method chosen to establish the system development charge is
based on the premise that new customers are entitled to water and/or sewer
services at the same rates charged to existing customers. However, it is also
recognized that existing customers have provided funds for debt retirement,
cash financing of improvements and additions to the water and/or sewer system
through payment of water/sewer rates or through their own contribution of
capital. New connections to the system shall be required to pay an amount
corresponding to that which has already been paid by existing customers towards
the water and sewer facilities.
   (B)   Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions
shall apply, unless the context clearly requires a different meaning.
   “COMMISSION.” The Shelbyville Municipal Water and Sewer Commission.
   “SDC: SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGE.” The charge for a new water and/or sewer
connection which corresponds to that amount which has already been paid by
existing customers towards the invested capital funds of the system.
   “SEWER INSPECTION FEE.” That fee established by ordinance to recover costs
of inspection of new sewer service connections and to obtain a sewer use
permit.
   “SEWER TAP FEE.” That fee established by ordinance to assist in covering
cost with future debt service requirements for future expansion of wastewater
facilities.
   “WATER METER FEE.” That fee established by ordinance to recover costs of
setting new water services, inclusive of the metering device.
   (C)   Method of establishing the system development charges. The system buy-
in method utilizes the calculations of existing customer's equity based on:
      (1)   Present value of assets;
      (2)   Outstanding indebtedness;
      (3)   Depreciation;
      (4)   Existing plant capacity and current usage; and
      (5)   Present worth of the system development charge;
to arrive at customer equity in terms of one thousand (1,000) gallons per month
of water and/or sewer usage.
   (D)   System development charges.

ARTICLE II. WATER
Division 1. General Provisions
§ 31.400 AUTHORITY TO FLUORIDATE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY
   Upon receiving the approval of the State Department of Public Health, and
until further direction of the City Council, the Municipal Water and Sewer
Commission is hereby authorized to provide the necessary funds and equipment
and proceed with the addition of approximately one (1) and not more than 1.5
parts of fluoride to every million parts of water distributed in the water
supply of the city.
(1986 Code)
§ 31.401 WATER SHUT-OFF VALVE REQUIRED
   (A)   All customers of the Commission shall have installed a main shut-off
valve on the inside of a foundation wall, which is accessible, as required by
the State Plumbing Code and 815 KAR20.120. In addition, those customers which
have other potable water lines, i.e., for other buildings that are not
controlled by the shut-off valve described above, shall have shut-off valves in
their water plumbing system to enable them to control their water plumbing
system.
   (B)   The water meter vault shall not be opened, entered, nor tampered with
by anyone other than an employee of the Commission. In the event of an
emergency, a Master Plumber licensed by the State of Kentucky may enter the
meter vault; however, such an entry shall be for the purpose of an emergency
only. If such an entry does occur, the licensed Master Plumber shall ensure
that a main shut-off valve, as described in subsection (A) above, is installed
for the customer in order to prevent future entries into the meter vault, and
shall report the entry and installation of a shut-off valve to the Commission
offices within forty-eight (48) hours after entry and installation.
   (C)   The Commission disclaims any responsibility or liability to a customer
due to leakage from the customer's water supply occurring on the customer's
side of the meter vault.
   (D)   In the event of unauthorized entrance or tampering with a meter vault
by a customer, the Commission shall bill the customer for any costs and damages
incurred due to unauthorized entrance to the meter or appurtenances. The
Commission shall notify the customer by certified mail of violation upon
discovery of the first occasion of tampering. After the first violation and
notification, any person violating the provisions of this section shall be
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by fine of not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00)
   (E)   In the event a customer does not have a shut-off valve, or a leak
occurs between the meter vault and the shut-off valve, the Commission may
respond within its ability to turn off water, but a service charge of forty
dollars ($40.00) after normal working hours shall be billed to the customer. If
there is not a shut-off valve, then a shut-off valve must be installed before
Commission personnel may turn the water back on. In the event of extraordinary
or unforeseen circumstances, Commission personnel may turn the water on, but a
shut-off valve shall be installed within forty-eight (48) hours, or the water
shall be turned back off, with the customer paying all costs.

Division 3. Water Rationing Guidelines
§ 31.600 PURPOSE
   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the declaration of water
rationing for equitable distribution of critically short water supplies.
Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to interfere with common law
riparian or statutory water rights.
(Ord. 2001-05-03(B), passed 5-3-01)
§ 31.601 DEFINITIONS
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "ALLOTMENT." The maximum quantity of water allowed for each customer over
any applicable period as established in the provisions of this subchapter.

(Ord. 2001-05-03(B), passed 5-3-01)
§ 31.602 DECLARATION OF RATIONING
   Whenever the Shelbyville City Council finds a need to provide for the
equitable distribution of critically-limited water supplies, in order to
balance demand and limited available supplies, and to assure that sufficient
water is available to preserve public health and safety, it shall, upon a
recommendation by the Commission, be empowered to declare by resolution the
adoption of mandatory rationing.
(Ord. 2001-05-03(B), passed 5-3-01)
§ 31.603 OBJECTIVES OF RATIONING
   (A)   It is imperative that water customers achieve an immediate further
reduction in water use in order to extend existing water supplies and, at the
same time, assure that sufficient water is available to preserve the public
health and sanitation and to provide fire protection service.
   (B)   Should shortages continue, further reductions in usage may be
required. The additional usage reduction in the rationed area must be a valid
and attainable goal reflective of the conditions which currently exist.
   (C)   The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage and for
equal sacrifice on the part of each water consumer. The success of this
ordinance depends on the cooperation of all water customers in the emergency
area.
(Ord. 2001-05-03(B), passed 5-3-01)
§ 31.604 WATER USE RATIONING FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS
   (A)   Metered residential water customers and allotments:
      (1)   Residential customers shall limit their usage to no more than three
thousand six hundred (3,600) gallons per month. Where only one person
constitutes a residence, the limitation shall be one thousand six hundred fifty
(1,650) gallons, which is based on fifty-five (55) gallons/day for that person.
In the event of a dispute, the number of permanent residents in each dwelling
unit (household) will determine the amount of water that a household will be
allowed.
      (2)   Residential water customers are required to not interfere with
Commission personnel in allowing reasonable access to read meters as necessary
for this rationing declaration. In the event a water customer does not allow
entry to read the meter after reasonable efforts to arrange for such access,
the dwelling unit (household) allotment will be reduced to a total of fifty-
five (55) gallons per day; forty (40) gallons for households with only one
permanent resident.
      (3)   Where the residential water allotment provided under this section
would create an extraordinary hardship, as in the case of special health-
related requirements, the water customer may apply to the Commission for an
exemption or variance from these requirements. If it is found that the
allotment provided in this section would impose an extraordinary hardship, a
revised allotment for the particular customer may be established. Any person
aggrieved by a decision relating to such an exemption or variance rendered by
the Commission may file a complaint with the City Council.
(Ord. 2001-05-03(B), passed 5-3-01)
§ 31.605 WATER USE RATIONING FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL WATER CUSTOMERS
   (A)   Non-residential water customers shall further reduce their water usage
to fifty percent (50%) of normal use levels as compared to previous history for
the most recent record of the June through July months.
   (B)   It is the primary responsibility of each non-residential water
customer to meet its mandated water use reduction goal in whatever manner
possible.
   (C)   The Commission will establish a water allotment for each non-
residential water customer, based on a required further reduction of water
usage from the rate of water used by the customer in effect on the last
recorded usage level.
   (D)   No non-residential water customer shall interfere with the
Commission's access to water meters, especially for the purpose of compliance
with this subchapter.
   (E)   If the mandated further reduction in water usage cannot be obtained
without imposing an extraordinary hardship which threatens health and safety,
the non-residential customer may apply to the Commission for a variance. For
these purposes extraordinary hardship means a permanent damage to property or
economic loss which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne by
other water uses subject to this water rationing subchapter. If the further
reduction would cause an extraordinary hardship or threaten health or safety, a
variance may be granted and a revised water use reduction requirement for the
particular customer be established. Any person aggrieved by a decision relating
to such an exemption or variance rendered by the Commission may file a
complaint with the City Council.
(Ord. 2001-05-03(B), passed 5-3-01)
§ 31.606 WATER USE RATIONING FOR HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES
   (A)   Hospitals and health care facilities shall comply with all
restrictions imposed on residential and non-residential water customers as may
be applicable to each individual institution, to the extent compliance will not
endanger the health of the patients or residents of the institution.
   (B)   Each hospital or health care facility shall survey its water usage
patterns and requirements and implement such additional conservation measures
as may be possible without endangering the health of its patients or residents
to achieve a further reduction in the institution's water usage.
(Ord. 2001-05-03(B), passed 5-3-01)
§ 31.607 ENFORCEMENT OF WATER RATIONING.
   (A)   The Commission will have primary responsibility for monitoring of
compliance with the water rationing subchapter.
   (B)   The following provisions shall govern the implementation of service
interruptions:
      (1)   In order to effectuate compliance with this subchapter, the
Commission is hereby authorized and required to plan and implement service
interruptions to all or a part of its water supply system, as may be deemed
appropriate, when and/or all of the following conditions are determined to
exist:
         (a)   The mandated reduction in system-wide usage has not been
achieved, and/or
         (b)   The mandated reduction in system-wide water usage has been
achieved, but has failed to have a significant impact in extending limited
water supplies, and/or
         (c)   Service interruptions are necessary in order to further extend
limited and/or dwindling water supplies.
      (2)   In the event it is determined that service interruptions are
necessary, the Commission shall notify its customers that a planned service
interruption is to be imposed. This shall be done through the public media
(newspaper, radio and television) and at least one day prior to the service
interruption. Such notice shall:
         (a)   State the day or days when the planned service interruptions
shall occur;
         (b)   State the time(s) when such planned service interruptions will
commence, and the time(s) such interruptions will cease;
         (c)   State whether the planned service interruptions are to be
imposed on the entire system, or part thereof, and, if only part(s) of the
system will experience planned service interruptions, identify geographic
boundaries within which such interruptions will occur; and
         (d)   Advise all customers within the areas affected by planned
service interruptions how to treat any water received from the system, for
human consumption, during the period(s) of such interruptions and for such
additional time as may be necessary until full pressure is restored to the
system.
      (3)   If a planned service interruption is imposed as authorized and
required by this subchapter, it must provide for the continued delivery of
water to health care facilities within the area(s) affected by such
interruptions, by means of any adequate, alternative delivery measures that may
be necessary.
      (4)   If a planned service interruption is implemented as authorized and
required by this subchapter, it must make provision, by any means possible, for
the continued delivery of such water as may be necessary for the proper
operation of sewage collection, treatment, and disposal systems and facilities.
   (C)   Any residential or non-residential water customer who exceeds the
allotments established pursuant to this water rationing will be subject to the
following excess-use charges:
      (1)   Excess-use charges will be collected based on the amount by which a
customer's use exceeds the water allotments established pursuant to the local
water rationing declaration, computed in accordance with the following
schedule:
 
EXCESS USAGE PER MONTH                  CHARGE FOR EXCESS
First 2,000 gallons or portion thereof  $8.00 per 1,000 gallons or portion
                                        thereof
Each 1,000 gallons, or portion thereof, $15.00 per 1,000
thereafter
 
   (D)   In addition to the excess-use charge, non-compliance with the water
rationing provisions of this subchapter will result in the following:
      (1)   For the first excess use, a warning of possible discontinuation
shall be issued to the customer.
      (2)   For the second or subsequent excess use, service to the customer
may be interrupted or shut off for a period not to exceed forty-eight (48)
hours, or, if the customer provides access, a flow restrictor may be installed
in the customer's service line for the duration of the emergency. The cost
incurred to interrupt or shut off and reinstate service, or to install and
remove a flow restrictor, shall be assessed to the water customer.
   (E)   Meter reading schedules are authorized to be altered to assure
adequate monitoring of compliance with this subchapter.
   (F)   Any customer or other person aggrieved by a decision or action
imposing an excess-use charge or other remedy for non-compliance with the
requirements of this subchapter may proceed in accordance with the following
provisions:
      (1)   The Commission shall adopt procedures which provide an opportunity
for the customer or aggrieved party to rebut the finding of a violation, or
provide evidence of circumstances beyond the customer's control which resulted
in the violation. A record of evidence regarding disputed violations shall be
kept, and a written notice of the Commission's final decision and action in
such cases shall be provided to the customer or aggrieved party.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the final decision or action of the
Commission may file a complaint with the City Council.

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 32.001 DEFINITIONS
   The terms as used in this chapter are further defined in the city Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual.
(Ord. 2012-06-07, passed 6-7-12)
§ 32.002 PURPOSE
   The Clean Water Act, EPA and KYDOW established Phase II regulations and
mandated Erosion Protection and Sediment Control (ESPC) procedures for
construction in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. During the construction process
soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers
water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic
habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates
repair of storm sewers, ditches and basins. Streets and roads with sediment
deposits are slick and hazardous to the public. In addition, clearing and
grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for
terrestrial and aquatic habitat. The purpose of the following regulations is to
safeguard persons, protect property and prevent damage to the environment.
These regulations also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and
controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or
land in the city. Any construction that involves the movement or excavation of
soil shall be conducted in a manner as to prevent erosion off-site or into
drainage structures. If deemed necessary by the City Engineer, an Erosion
Prevention and Sediment Control Plan (EPSC) may be required.
(Ord. 2012-06-07, passed 6-7-12)
§ 32.003 PERMITS REQUIRED, EXCEPTIONS AND FEES
   (A)   Permits are required to be obtained from the city for all site
construction projects and/or land disturbance as set out in the city Stormwater
Best Management Practices (BMP) Manual. The developer shall also coordinate
with the KYDOW and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether
permits are required from these agencies before construction begins. Each
developer shall submit an application to the city of a form provided by the
city. Each permit application shall include a statement that any land clearing,
construction or development involving the movement of earth shall be in
accordance with the EPSC Plan and that a certified contractor shall be
responsible for implementing and maintaining all aspects of the plan.
   (B)   No permit shall be required from the city for emergency activity that
is immediately necessary for the protection of life, property or natural
resources or for existing nursery and agricultural operations conducted as a
permitted main or accessory use.
   (C)   All permit applications shall include the appropriate erosion review/
land disturbance and inspection permit fee. Depending on the amount of land
disturbance, various levels of permits are required with verifying amounts of
application fees. The permits required to be obtained from the city, the items
required for each permit type and the fee amounts for each permit type are
contained in the city Stormwater BMP Manual.
(Ord. 2012-06-07, passed 6-7-12)
§ 32.004   REVIEW AND ISSUANCE OF PERMIT
   (A)   The city will review each permit application to determine its
conformance with the provisions of this section. Approval indicates that
minimum requirements or intent are met and does not imply guarantee of
performance. Based on the review of the permit application, the city will:
      (1)   Approve the permit application;
      (2)   Approve the permit application subject to such conditions as may be
necessary to meet the requirements/intent of the objectives of this section,
and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or
      (3)   Deny the permit application, indicating the reason(s) and procedure
for submitting a revised application and/or submission.
   (B)   The city reserves the right to inspect the site prior to any
construction activity in furtherance of the review process.
   (C)   The city’s approval of the permit is for general compliance with local
requirements and the KYDOW general permit. The designer is ultimately
responsible for the details of design of the EPSC Plan, with the property owner
being responsible for implementation.
(Ord. 2012-06-07, passed 6-7-12)
§ 32.005   RIGHT OF ENTRY
   The city or its designated agent may enter the property of the applicant as
deemed necessary to make regular inspections to ensure the validity of the
reports required by this subchapter.
(Ord. 2012-06-07, passed 6-7-12)
§ 32.006   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
   Requirements for the design, maintenance and a menu of Best Management
Practices (BMPs) are located in the Construction Site Stormwater Run-Off
Control Seciton of the city Stormwater BMP Manual. The regulations set forth in
the city Stormwater BMP Manual shall be the standard of practice for site
construction within the city.
(Ord. 2012-06-07, passed 6-7-12)
ARTICLE II. NON-STORM WATER DISCHARGES
§ 32.010 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide for the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation
of non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum

(Ord. 2009-03-05, passed 3-5-09)
ARTICLE III. POST DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 32.035 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
   (A)   To fully comply with federally mandated stormwater regulations, the
city is required to address runoff from post construction areas. Post
construction stormwater management in areas undergoing new development or
redevelopment is necessary because runoff from these areas has been shown to
significantly affect receiving water bodies. Many studies indicate that prior
planning and design for the minimization of pollutants in post construction
stormwater discharges is the most cost effective approach to stormwater
management.
   (B)   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is empowered to regulate
storm water by the authority of The Clean Water Act. The city, classified as a
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) under Phase II of the National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Storm Water Program, is
empowered to regulate non-storm water discharges.
(Ord. 2009-10-01, passed 10-1-09; Am. Ord. 2012-09-20(B), passed 9-20-12)
§ 32.036 DEFINITIONS
   The terms used in this article shall have the definitions stated in the City
of Shelbyville Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual.
(Ord. 2009-10-01, passed 10-1-09)
§ 32.037 LIMIT OF LIABILITY
   (A)   Nothing contained in this article or the City of Shelbyville
Stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP) Manual is intended to be or shall be
construed to create or form the basis for liability on the part of the city,
its officers, employees, agents, or the utility, for any injury or damage
resulting from flooding or flood related events due to improperly sized
drainage facilities or surface and storm events which exceed design capacities.
   (B)   Floods from surface and storm water runoff may occasionally occur
which exceed the capacity of surface and storm water drainage facilities
constructed and maintained under this article or Shelbyville's Best Management
Practices Manual. The city's adoption of this article does not imply that
property responsible for the surface and storm water drainage shall always be
free from surface and storm water flooding and riverine floods. Further, this
article does not claim to reduce the need or the necessity for any property
owner/developer/applicant to obtain flood insurance.
(Ord. 2009-10-01, passed 10-1-09; Am. Ord. 2012-09-20(B), passed 9-20-12)
§ 32.038 APPLICABILITY
   The city requires post construction stormwater BMPs on development and
redevelopment construction projects that meet the criteria herein below and
review and approval is required prior to commencement of construction where
such construction is expected to disturb one (1) acre or more or is a part of a
larger common development. In addition, the city requires post construction
stormwater management BMPs for "hot spot" locations. "Hot spot" locations
include the following:
   (A)   Automotive fueling facilities;
   (B)   Automotive maintenance and repair facilities;
   (C)   Restaurants with grease collection and disposal; and
   (D)   Other land uses as determined to have a high potential of pollutant
discharge into the MS4 as determined by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2009-10-01, passed 10-1-09)
§ 32.039 REVIEW AND ISSUANCE OF PERMIT
   (A)   For projects requiring post construction BMPs, plans that are
submitted as part of the application process (e.g. building permit, detailed
development plan or subdivision plan,) (collectively referred to herein as
"permit") shall conform to the design criteria set forth in the version of the
City of Shelbyville Stormwater Best Management Practice Manual that is the most
current at the time permit is submitted; and such plans shall be designed to
accommodate the quantity, flow, and discharge for the 80th percentile, 24-hour
storm event. Design shall require, in combination or alone, management measures
that are designed, built and maintained to treat, filter, flocculate,
infiltrate, screen, evapotranspire, harvest and reuse stormwater runoff, or
otherwise manage the stormwater runoff quality. The Manual is available online
at www.shelbyvillekentucky.com. Based on the review of the permit application,
the city will:
      (1)   Approve the permit application;
      (2)   Approve the permit application subject to such conditions as may be
necessary to meet the requirements/intents of the objectives this article/City
of Shelbyville Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual and issue the permit
subject to these conditions; or
      (3)   Deny the permit application, indicating the reason(s) and procedure
for submitting a revised application and/or subdivision.
   (B)   The city reserves the right to inspect the site prior to any
construction activity in furtherance of the review process.
   (C)   The city's approval of the permit is for general compliance with local
requirements and the KYDOW general permit. The designer is ultimately
responsible for the details of the design, with the property owner being
responsible for implementation.
   (D)   For projects that cannot meet this water-quality treatment standard,
the property owner may choose either of the following options:
      (1)   Off-site mitigation option: Under this option the property owner
shall implement infiltration/evapotranspiration/reuse measures at another
location within the same watershed as the original project, pursuant to a
design submitted to the city and which must meet city approval. This option
requires easements from affected property owners; further provisions shall be
made for perpetual maintenance of such measures through the filing of deed
restrictions. The city may assume perpetual maintenance for such a project only
to further a significant public purpose.
      (2)   Payment-in-lieu option: This option allows the owner/operator of a
construction site that disturbs at least one acre, or a project that is less
than one acre but is part of a larger common plan of development or sale, to
choose to make a payment to the city, in lieu of implementing post construction
BMPs. The city shall apply these in-lieu to a public stormwater quality
project. The amount of payment-in-lieu shall be 150% of the design and
installation of required post-construction facilities for the proposed
development. The amount shall be submitted by the developer for review and
approval by the city.

§ 32.040 MAINTENANCE
   (A)   As an additional requirement to obtain the permit provided for in §
32.039, the property owner shall enter into an inspection and maintenance
agreement, the terms of which shall be approved by the city. The Maintenance
Agreement shall be executed before the city shall grant final approval of the
stormwater management plan and issuance of permits. A copy of the maintenance
agreement may be found in the City of Shelbyville Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual.
   (B)   The property owner/developer/applicant shall be responsible for all
maintenance and record keeping as detailed in the maintenance agreement set
forth in the most recent version of the City of Shelbyville Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual.

except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend or symbolic
message, and said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and
pedestrians as follows.
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or any other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Vehicular traffic shall
yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and
to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a
turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.

or yellow indication is allowed to complete a left turn during the red
indication.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication.

that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian-control signal, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no
pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except
as follows.
         (a)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by this
division (C) with the intention of making a right turn, may make the right
turn, after stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such
movement, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic
lawfully proceeding through the intersection;
         (b)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by this
division (C) whose vehicle is in the left lane of a one-way highway with the
intention of making a left turn onto the left lane of another one-way highway
with the flow of traffic, may make the left turn, after stopping, unless an
official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding through the
intersection; and
         (c)   In instances where there are two (2) right or left turn lanes,
an allowable turn under this section may be made from either lane unless a
regulatory sign specifically prohibits it.
      (2)   The city may, by ordinance, prohibit any such right or left turn
against a steady red signal at any intersection, which prohibition shall be
effective when an official sign prohibiting the movement is erected at the
intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (E)   Any person operating a motorcycle who violates division (C) of this
section by entering or crossing an intersection controlled by a traffic control
signal against a steady red light shall have an affirmative defense to that
charge if the person establishes all of the following conditions:
      (1)   The motorcycle was brought to a complete stop;
      (2)   The traffic control signal continued to show a steady red light for
120 seconds or the traffic control signal at the intersection has completed two
lighting cycles;
      (3)   The traffic control signal was apparently malfunctioning or, if
programmed or engineered to change to a green light only after detecting the
approach of a motor vehicle, the signal apparently failed to detect the arrival
of a motorcycle; and
      (4)   No motor vehicle or person was approaching on the street or highway
to be crossed or entered, or any approaching person or vehicle was so far away
from the intersection that it did not constitute an immediate hazard.
   (F)   The affirmative defense outlined in division (E) of this section shall
only apply to a violation for entering or crossing an intersection controlled
by a traffic signal against a steady red light and shall not provide a defense
to any other civil or criminal action.
   (G)   In the event a motorcyclist exercises the affirmative defense
provisions set forth in division (E) of this section, the Transportation
Cabinet or its employees are specifically immune from any and all civil
liability arising from any such claim, lawsuit, or dispute. Any claim, lawsuit,
or dispute against the Transportation Cabinet as a result of the affirmative
defense set forth in division (E) of this section, shall be brought using the
provisions outlined in KRS Chapter 44.

intermittent flashes, operators of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the

of Public Works/City Engineer, the city may perform the work or contract for
the work and deduct the expense from any cash bond and require payment by the
surety bondsman. The principal on the bond shall be liable for any deficiency
in the bond amount to cover the expense. A surety bond shall have as surety a
corporation licensed to do business in Kentucky as a surety company and
approved by the Director of Public Works/City Engineer. The amount of the bond
shall be two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), or the amount estimated by the
Director of Public Works/City Engineer to be the actual cost of restoration
considering the hazards involved, whichever is greater. However, any person or
utility may post a continuous bond in an amount not less than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) in lieu of separate bonds for each permit.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the expiration of any bond required under this section

and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations
and taking other measures suitable for the purpose, including, but not limited
to, shoring up and protecting all buildings, walls, fences, or other property
likely to be damaged during the facility work. All facility work must be
conducted and facilities located so as to cause minimum interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners. The city may from time-
to-time issue such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the installation
and maintenance of the facilities installed in the public way as may be
consistent with this chapter. Whenever it may be necessary to trench through
any lawn area on public or private property, that area shall be reseeded or the
sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been
backfilled as required by this chapter. All construction and maintenance work
shall be done in a like manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth
and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed
before the work began. A utility may trim trees within the public way at its
own expense as necessary to protect its wires and facilities, subject to any

any street shall be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger
those working in the trench, pedestrians, or users of the streets, and so that
as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and
adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow, considering traffic volume and width of the public way, to permit the
piling of excavated material beside the trench, the Director of Public Works/
City Engineer shall have the authority to require the excavated material to be
hauled to a storage site pending backfill, in which event it shall be the
responsibility of the person giving notice to secure the necessary permission
and make all necessary arrangements for storage and disposal sites. All
excavated material shall be laid compactly along the side of the trench and
kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably possible to

(Ord. 2008-06-05(B), passed 6-5-08)
§ 60.014 ACTIVITIES SUBJECT TO LICENSE FEES
   (A)   Income received from real estate. The income received from the
operation of real estate by persons, trust companies, or real estate agents,
for or on behalf of persons (or estates) is subject to the license fee imposed
by this chapter as follows:
      (1)   The operation of warehouses, apartments, hotels, motels, tourist
homes, and similar structures, constitutes a subject activity, and the income
therefrom is subject to the fee imposed by the chapter.
      (2)   The income derived from apartment houses, single dwellings, and
other rental property is considered subject to the fee imposed by the chapter.
When the operation thereof constitutes an activity within the meaning of this
chapter and if the activity requires at least twenty percent (20%) of a
person's activity time, or amounts to twenty percent (20%) of a person's gross
income, then he will be presumed to be engaged in the real estate business. To
the extent that a person is engaged in managing real estate for at least twenty
percent (20%) of his activity time, or income therefrom amounts to twenty
percent (20%) of a person's gross income, he is engaged in the real estate
business. This does not preclude an inquiry into each particular case if it is
considered necessary.
      (3)   All corporations engaged in the rental of real estate or
partnerships organized for that purpose shall be considered to be engaged in a
subject activity.
      (4)   When any property falls within the classification above given, the
manner of its acquisition, such as by purchase, gift, inheritance, fiduciary,
or as fiduciary mortgage in possession, and so on, does not affect the
subjectability of the income derived therefrom.
      (5)   When the property is located within the city limits, the residence
of the beneficiary is immaterial.
   (B)   Trusts. Whenever a trust estate is engaged in enterprise, activity, or
business, which is productive of income, the activity or business shall be
considered subject to the license fee.
   (C)   Trading and securities. Where a person engages in buying and selling
of stocks, bonds, or other types of securities and those transactions are not
isolated and few, but are extended so as to constitute an activity, the net
profits therefrom are subject to the license fee.
   (D)   Fiduciary. Money received by a fiduciary is subject income, where a
fiduciary is regularly engaged in a business or profession as a fiduciary or is
engaged in a business or profession commonly regarded as being incidental or
collateral thereto, for example, an attorney-at-law, real estate agent, and the
like; or if commissions or fees represent a substantial portion of the earnings
or income of the fiduciary, or when the administration of the trust requires a
substantial portion of the fiduciary's available working time.
   (E)   Independent contractor. An independent contractor is a person who,
while performing services for another, is under the direction and control of
the other person only as to the result to be accomplished by the work and not
as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished, including but
not limited to, authors, professionals, seamstresses, laundresses, tailors, or
registered nurses. Withholding does not apply to independent contractors, but
the income received by such persons is subject to the business net profits tax.
   (F)   Insurance agents.
      (1)   Individuals engaged in the sale of insurance may be either
employees or independent contractors.
         (a)   Where the individual is subject to the direct control of another
as to the manner of his conduct and is paid a fixed fee, he is considered an
employee and the amount of the license shall be withheld at the source.
         (b)   Where the individual is not under the direct control of another
and may conduct the sale as he sees fit, receiving his payment in the form of
commission from the sale, he is considered an independent contractor and shall
file his own return and make payment as an independent contractor.
      (2)   Commissions subject to license fee.
         (a)   In determining whether the commission payable by reasons of the
selling of any policy by an agent resulted from work done or services performed
or rendered in the city, the test shall be the residence of the insured at the
time of issuance of the policy, rather than the actual place of solicitation,
except where the solicitation is in the city and agent's established place of
business is within the city, the commission is subject to the license fee
regardless of the residence of the insured.
         (b)   If an agent has an office outside the city as well as an office
of his own within the city, the commission on policies sold to nonresidents, if
handled through the outside office, are not subject to a license fee, since,
under those circumstances, they are not earnings or profits of an independent
city business.
      (3)   Group insurance commissions. Commissions paid on the sale of
contracts of group insurance are subject if the group is located within the
city as a unit without regard to the residence of the writing agent.
      (4)   Bonuses and incentive payments subject to license fees. That
proportionate part of all bonuses and incentive payments received by an agent,
which bears the same ratio to the total amount of bonuses and incentive
payments received by him, as the amount of commissions received by him, on
policies sold to residents, bears to the total amount of commissions received
by him on all policies sold, to both resident and non residents is subject to
the license fee.
      (5)   Advance the drawing accounts.
         (a)   There are two (2) main types of advances an drawing account
payments:
            1.   Those which impose upon the agent a written obligation to
repay if they are not in fact earned.
            2.   Those which (though offset by commissions as earned) cannot be
recovered at law even though the agent fails to produce enough business to
justify them.
         (b)   The first of these two (2) types of advance and drawing account
payments is in the nature of a loan and accordingly is never subject to license
fee. All commissions or bonuses applied toward the repayment of these types of
advances and drawing accounts are subject in accordance with the rules set
forth above.
         (c)   The second type of advance and drawing account payment is
subject compensation when received to the extent that it exceeds compensation
earned after July 1.
      (6)   Collection of license fee at source. It is the duty of all
companies doing business in the city (or general agents in the cases of agents
whose contracts are with a general agent alone and to whom payment is made by
general agent out of funds of the general agent) to deduct or withhold monthly
or more often the amounts of license fee due on all compensation paid to agents
who are considered employees.
   (G)   Partnerships, associations, or other unincorporated business. In the
cases of partnership, association, or other incorporated business owned by one
(1) or more persons, the license fee, generally shall be upon that partnership,
association, or business enterprise as an entity and not ordinarily upon the
partners or members thereof.
   (H)   Federal, state, and municipal employees.
      (1)   Compensation received from the federal government for services
performed within any federal reservation situated within the geographical
limits of the city, title to which is in the federal government, is subject to
income, even though exclusive jurisdiction thereof was granted to the federal
government by the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the city.
      (2)   Compensation received from state, county, and municipal
governmental agencies is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Refund of tax withheld and paid covering activities outside the
city will be made to employee upon application on a form provided by City
Clerk/Treasurer.
   (I)   Real estate salesman or brokers.
      (1)   Real estate salesmen or brokers who are engaged in the business as
employees rather than an independent contractor are not required to file a
return for the commissions earned by them. The employer is required to deduct
the fee from the commissions earned and remit the same to the City Clerk/
Treasurer.
      (2)   Real estate salesmen or brokers acting as independent contractors
are subject to a license fee on their net profits in accordance with the rules
and regulations herein pertinent.

provisions of the franchise agreement and this chapter, the words of this
chapter shall be deemed to control unless the franchise agreement expressly
provides to the contrary.
   (F)   Any application filed for a franchise shall become a part of the
franchise agreement and any representations, promises, commitments or
volunteered parameters and/or standards shall become binding upon the
franchisee and its heirs and assigns.

§ 64.008 INTERPRETATION OF FRANCHISE TERMS
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter will apply to a franchise agreement as

§ 64.010 GRANT OF FRANCHISES
   (A)   The city may grant a franchise for a period not to exceed twelve (12)
years.
   (B)   The city may make the grant of a franchise conditioned upon the
completion of construction within a prescribed time or upon the performance of
other specific obligations, specifying in the franchise agreement that failure
to timely comply with the condition will cause the franchise to become null and
void without further action by the city.
   (C)   In evaluating an application for a new franchise, the city shall
consider the applicant's character; the applicant's technical, financial, and
legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed system; the nature
of the proposed facilities, equipment, and services; the applicant's record in
other communities, if any; and whether the proposal will meet anticipated
community needs and serve the public interest.
   (D)   Based upon the application, the written and oral testimony and other
material presented at a public hearing before the Council, and any other
information relevant to the application, the Council shall decide whether to
grant or deny a franchise application. If two (2) or more competing
applications are filed in response to a request for proposals, the Council
shall grant the application which it considers to represent the highest and
best bid in terms of the overall public interest. However, the Council is not
obligated to grant any application if it considers that the public interest is
not served thereby.
   (E)   If the Council grants a franchise application, the City Attorney and
the applicant must agree on the terms of a franchise agreement within ninety
(90) calendar days from the date of the resolution making the grant. This
period may be extended for good cause by the Council. If agreement is not
reached with the City Attorney within ninety (90) calendar days or if the
period is not extended by the Council, the franchise grant will be null and
void without further action by the city.
   (F)   The text of a proposed franchise agreement must be consistent with the
requirements of this chapter and be made available by the city to the public
and advertised as required by city procedure.
   (G)   After complying with the requirements of subsections (C) - (F) above,
the Council shall, following a public hearing, approve or disapprove the
proposed franchise agreement by resolution.
   (H)   The grant of an initial franchise or a renewed franchise may be
subject to a franchise acceptance fee, subject to mutual agreement, in an
amount not to exceed the city's out-of-pocket costs in considering the
application, less the amount of the filing fee. Within thirty (30) calendar
days of the date the resolution approving the franchise agreement the city must
notify the approved applicant of the amount of any franchise acceptance fee and
its method of calculation. If the franchise acceptance fee is not paid within
sixty (60) calendar days of the date of the Council resolution approving the
franchise agreement, the grant will be null and void. Prior to the franchise
becoming effective, the approved applicant must demonstrate compliance with the
surety, insurance and similar provisions of the franchise agreement.

§ 64.011 SECURITY FUND
   (A)   Prior to a franchise or franchise renewal becoming effective, the
franchisee must post with the city a cash security deposit in the minimum
amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or such other amount as specified
in the franchise agreement to be used as a security fund to ensure the faithful
performance of all provisions of law and the franchise agreement and compliance
with all orders, permits and directions of the city, and the payment by the
franchisee of any claims, liens or taxes due the city which arise by reason of
the construction, operation or maintenance of the system.
   (B)   The city shall place the security deposit in an interest bearing
account. The interest will accrue to the benefit of the franchisee but may not
be withdrawn; all interest will be added to and become part of the original
security fund during the term of the franchise.
   (C)   If a franchise fails to pay the city any fees or taxes due, liquidated
damages, damages, or costs or expenses incurred by the city by reason of any
act or default of the franchisee, or if the franchisee fails to comply with any
provision of the franchise agreement that the city reasonably determines can be
remedied by an expenditure of the security fund, the city may, after ten (10)
calendar days notice to the franchisee, withdraw that amount with any interest
from the failure by the franchisee to secure consents from the owners, security
fund. Upon such withdrawal, the city shall notify the franchisee of the amount
and date of the withdrawal.
   (D)   Within thirty (30) calendar days after notice to it that an amount has
been withdrawn by the city from the security fund, the franchisee must deposit
a sum of money sufficient to restore the security fund to the original amount.
If the franchisee fails to restore the security fund to the original amount
within thirty (30) calendar days, the entire security fund remaining may be
forfeited, and/or such failure may be considered a material breach of this
chapter and may be used as grounds for revocation of the franchise.
   (E)   The security fund will become the property of the city in the event
the franchise is revoked. The franchisee is entitled to the return of the
security fund that remains following termination of the franchise, less any
outstanding default or unpaid amounts owed to the city by the franchisee.
   (F)   The rights reserved the city with respect to the security fund are in
addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by this chapter or
authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with
respect to such security fund will affect any other right the city may have.

communication over the cable system, excepting programming on government
channels, $2,000,000.
   (B)   All insurance policies must be with sureties qualified to do business
in Kentucky and in a form approved by the City Attorney. The city may require
in a franchise agreement coverage and amounts in excess of the above minimums.
   (C)   A franchisee must, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend the city, its officials, councils, commissions, agents and
employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and
judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction,
maintenance or operation of its cable system regardless of whether the act or
omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the franchise.
This provision includes, but is not limited to, claims arising out of copyright
infringements or authorized distributors, or licensees of programs to be
delivered by the cable system.
   (D)   The franchise agreement may require the franchisee to have in force at
all times a performance bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount as

   (E)   The city may inspect and audit any and all books and records of the

the audit.
   (F)   In the event that a franchise fee payment is not received by the city
on or before the due date, interest will be charged from the due date at an
interest rate of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month. In addition, the
franchisee will pay a late charge of five percent (5%) of the amount of such

comment on the recommended decision after its issuance.
   (G)   Based on the recommended decision, the comment and arguments

pendency of any other application for a franchise.
   (I)   Once the Council grants a renewal application, the city and the
franchisee must agree on a franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures
specified in Section (e)-(j), before the renewal becomes effective.
   (J)   If renewal of a franchise is denied, the city may require the former
franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment. If the former franchisee

qualifications of the transferee to operate the system and whether operation by
the transferee would adversely affect the cable services to subscribers or
otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

opportunity to present evidence and make argument. Following the public
hearing, the Council shall determine whether or not to revoke the franchise or
reduce its term based on any recommended decision, the evidence and argument
presented at the hearing, and other evidence of record. The Council's
determination shall be reflected in a written opinion setting forth the reasons
for its decision.

twenty (120) calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or
the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the

for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that
one hundred twenty (120) day period:

agreeing to be bound by the terms, and conditions of the franchise.

successful bidder; and
      (2)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise.

franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to its
subscribers, the following procedures and rights are effective:
      (1)   The city may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities
and equipment. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable
period of time, the city may have the removal done at the franchisee's and/or
surety's expense.

franchisee are satisfied.
   (B)   In the event of a termination or transfer of the franchise for
whatever reason, the franchisee must do everything in its power to ensure that
all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service through the existing
facilities unless the subscribers can reasonably be served by a competing cable
operator. Where necessary, the franchisee must cooperate with the city to
operate the system for a temporary period following termination or transfer as

shall be permitted to make arguments and provide comments. The Council shall
also consider any written comments which may have been submitted. Following the
public hearing, the Council shall either approve or disapprove the rate

(CCPA) (codified at 47 USC 542) expressly states that a franchise fee does not
include "requirements or charges incidental to the awarding or enforcing of the
franchise." It is expressly noted that there is a distinct difference between
the CCPA language, "...charges incidental to..." (meaning associated with or
necessitated by), and the often industry asserted contention equating such
intentionally explicit language of the Congress with their term "incidental
charges."
      (2)   As a result, and in addition to any other rights the city may have
under this chapter, the city specifically reserves the right to charge the
franchisee for any, and all, costs associated with enforcing this chapter or
franchising agreement.

any costs charged the franchisee are not more than the actual administrative,
professional, technical, legal, consulting, or financial charges incurred by

this chapter:
         (i)   consultants, and other experts, to assist in the awarding,
renewal, assignment, transfer, sale, or merger of a franchise, including costs
associated with drafting a franchise agreement, or reviewing petitions for
exemptions;

sessions/performance evaluations that the authority or city conduct with the

ARTICLE II. RATES AND CHARGES
§ 64.050 SCOPE; APPLICABILITY
   (A)   This subchapter governs the regulation of rates for basic service and
equipment within the city for any franchisee which has been notified that the
city has been certified to regulate its basic service and equipment rates; and
the city has adopted regulations governing regulation of basic service and
equipment rates. The provisions set forth are intended to be consistent with
all Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") regulations governing the
regulation of basic service rates and equipment. The city will regulate and
interpret its rules so that they are consistent with FCC regulations, as if
those regulations were set forth in full herein; the franchisee is prohibited
from engaging in any activity it is prohibited in engaging in under FCC rules,
as if those rules were set forth in full herein.
   (B)   For purposes of these provisions, the term "basic service" or "basic
cable service" has the same meaning as the term "basic service" at 47 C.F.R. §
76.901 and the term "equipment" refers to all equipment and services subject to
regulation under 47 C.F.R. § 76.923.
(Ord. 93-10-21A, passed 10-21-93)
§ 64.051 FILING; REVIEW OF RATES
   (A)   Initial filings by franchisees.
      (1)   Filings; when made. A franchise that is notified that its basic
service and equipment rates are subject to regulation must file a submission
("the rate filing") within thirty (30) days of the notification, justifying its
existing basic service and equipment rates. All rates, for all customer
classifications must be justified. Once a franchise has been so notified by the
city that its rates are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter increase
its rates for basic service or equipment without the prior approval of the
city. This requirement applies in all cases, including with respect to
increases in rates announced prior to the date the operator was notified its
rates were subject to regulation where the increases were not implemented prior
to the date of notice. A franchisee must submit a rate filing to justify any
increase in basic service or equipment rates or any new basic service or
equipment rate (collectively referred to herein as rate increases). An increase
occurs when there is an increase in rates or a decrease in program or customer
services. Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed
for review at least thirty (30) days in advance of the proposed effective date
of the increase. This requirement does not alter or eliminate any other notice
requirement.
      (2)   Filings; where made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the
City Clerk/Treasurer. A rate filing shall be considered filed for review on the
date the require rate filing and all required copies are received by the City
Clerk/Treasurer. Twenty (20) copies of each rate filing (including all
supporting materials) must be submitted. If the operator claims any part of the
filing is proprietary, it shall additionally file ten (10) copies, which omit
the proprietary information.
      (3)   Filing: contents. Subject to any FCC regulations governing the
burden of proof, a rate filing submitted by a franchisee must show that the
rates the franchisee proposes to charge to basic service and equipment are
reasonable. Except as inconsistent with FCC rules.
         (a)   Every rate filing must clearly state in a covering letter
whether it justifies existing rates; or proposes an increase in rates. The
covering letter must also identify any rate that is derived in whole or in part
based upon cost of service, and identify any pages of the rate filing that
contain information that the franchisee claims is proprietary. It must state
whether any part of the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment
or an alleged increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain
a brief, narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service.
         (b)   The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially.
         (c)   The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms and these
forms must be correctly completed.
      (4)   If the franchisee seeks to support a rate based upon a cost of
service, the city will establish a rate that provides the franchisee an
opportunity to recover the reasonable costs associated with providing basic
cable service, including a reasonable profit. An expense or investment is not
presumed reasonable merely because the franchisee has incurred or made it. A
franchisee is not entitled to recover monopoly profits in any form.
      (5)   In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to
provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee
who seeks to justify all or any part of its rates based upon its cost of
service must submit a complete cost of service analysis that shows all expenses
it incurs and all revenues derived from the system, directly or indirectly by
the franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator of the system
within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 522(4). The cost of service must identify the
accounting level (as that term is used in the FCC's regulations) at which each
expense or revenue identified was aggregated and shows clearly how the expense
or revenue was allocated. The franchisee may not include costs at an accounting
level unless it also includes all revenues from that same level attributable to
the system or to a group of systems of which the system serving the city is a
part. The replacement cost of a comparable system must be identified and
supported. The franchisee must identify the name and address of any entity with
which it has a contract, other than a programmer, which derives revenue from
the system, and must state whether and how the revenues of that entity were
included in the cost of service. In addition, the cost of service shall clearly
show the derivation of a proposed charge per channel and the application of
that charge to yield a basic service rate. It must also show and support the
derivation and allocation of any amounts included in the derivation of the rate
for:
         (a)   operation and maintenance expenses;
         (b)   administrative and general expenses;
         (c)   programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs
and copyright fees separately);
         (d)   costs for PEG access and any institutional network;
         (e)   franchise fee expenses;
         (f)   investment in the system and associated depreciation;
         (g)   other expenses, including federal, state and local taxes,
itemized; and
         (h)   the proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid
by the franchisee.
      (6)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee is not required to
submit the cost of service specified in subsection (A)(5) for equipment rates,
and instead initially shall complete, submit and support the costs of equipment
using applicable FCC forms. Any cost of service submitted to justify basic
service rates must show that the cost of service does not include equipment
costs.
   (B)   Initial review.
      (1)   After receiving a rate filing the City Clerk/Treasurer promptly
shall publish a notice that a filing has been received and that, except for
those parts which may be withheld as proprietary, it is available for public
review. The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the
filing, and shall provide interested parties seven (7) days to submit written
comments on the filing to the City Clerk/Treasurer. The City Clerk/Treasurer
shall submit the comments received and its recommendations for action to the
City Council no later than twenty (20) days after the filing and shall make
those recommendations available for public inspection. The franchisee may
submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations, but must do so
no later than three (3) business days after the staff recommendations are
submitted to the City Council. The response shall be filed with the City Clerk/
Treasurer, and if submitted in a timely fashion, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall
forward a copy to the City Council.
      (2)   Within thirty (30) days of the date of the filing, the City Council
shall issue a written order, which may be in any lawful form, approving the
proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in
part; or tolling the proposed rate in whole or in part. If the City Council
tolls the rate in whole or in part, its written order at a minimum shall
explain that it requires additional time to review the rate filing and state
that the franchisee may cure any deficiency in its filing by submitting a
supplementary filing as provided in subsection (C). With respect to existing
rates, tolling means the rates may remain in effect, subject to refund; with
respect to rate changes, tolling means the portion of the rate change that is
tolled may not go into effect.
   (C)   Supplementary filings.
      (1)   If a proposed rate is tolled in whole or in part, the franchisee
shall submit a supplementary filing twenty (20) days from the effective date of
the tolling order, containing corrections, if any, to its filing (including any
required supplement to its cost of service filing) and any response to
information filed by interested parties or to the recommendations of the staff,
or any additional information necessary to support the proposed rate.
Supplementary filings must be filed in accordance with subsection (A)(2).
      (2)   A supplementary filing also must contain such information as the
city directs the franchisee to provide.
      (3)   In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to
provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee
who claims that it is entitled to a rate in whole or in part based upon the
adjustments for inflation and external costs contemplated by 47 C.F.R. § 76.922
(d)(1)-(2) must submit the following:
         (a)   A calculation showing how each part of the adjustment was
derived;
         (b)   A statement itemizing each external cost (as defined by FCC
regulations), the amount of that external cost for the two (2) calendar years
prior to the date of the filing and the year-to-date in which the filing is
made; and the projected amount of the external cost for the remainder of the
year in which the filing is made and for the following calendar year. The
statement must specifically show any increases in revenues from programming
services. Revenues include all revenues, in whatever form received.
         (c)   If the increase is attributable to any increase in programming
service costs, the contract for each programming service whose cost has
increased; a sworn statement identifying each programming service whose costs
increased where the programmer is an affiliate of the franchisee (as defined by
FCC regulations); and, for any contract that has been in effect less than
twelve (12) months, the prior contract for the service.
         (d)   A sworn statement by the franchisee's chief financial officer or
an independent, certified accountant stating that he or she has examined all
external costs (including all programming costs) and has offset against any
increase claimed, the amount of any decreases in external costs, and the amount
by which any increase in external costs was below the GNP-PI, as required by 47
C.F.R. § 76.922(d)(2); affirming that the franchisee has only sought to recover
any external cost to the extent that cost exceeding the GNP-PI; and affirming
that the franchisee has not attempted to recover any increase in the cost of
programming purchased by an affiliate except as provided in 47 C.F.R. § 76.922
(d)(2)(vi).
      (4)   Upon receiving the supplementary filing, the City Clerk/Treasurer
promptly shall publish a notice that filing has been received and that it is
available for public review (except those parts which may be withheld as
proprietary). The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the
filing, and shall provide interested parties twenty (20) days to submit written
comments on the filing to the City Clerk/Treasurer. The City Clerk/Treasurer
shall submit the comments received and its recommendations for the action to
the City Council no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date the City
Council must act under subsection (7).
      (5)   The recommendations shall be made available for public inspection.
The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff
recommendations, but must do so no later than ten (10) days after the staff
recommendations are submitted to the City Council. The response shall be filed
with the City Clerk/Treasurer, and if submitted in timely fashion, the City
Clerk/Treasurer shall forward a copy to the City Council.
      (6)   The City Council shall issue a written order, which may be in any
lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the
proposed rate in whole or in part; or allowing the rate to go into effect in
whole or in part, subject to refund. If the City Council issues an order
allowing the rates to go into effect subject to refund, it shall also direct
the franchisee to maintain an accounting in accordance with 47 C.F.R. § 76.933.
      (7)   The order specified in subsection (6) shall be adopted within
ninety (90) days after the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justifies
based on the FCC benchmark. The order shall be adopted within one hundred fifty
(150) days of the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justified with a
cost of service showing.
(Ord. 93-10-21A, passed 10-21-93)
§ 64.052 RATE ORDERS
   (A)   Any rate order of the City Council shall be issued and effective upon
adoption. Each rate order shall be released to the public and the franchisee.
In any case where the City Council approves, denies, or tolls a rate; orders
that a rate may go into effect subject to refund; or orders refunds or
establishes rates, a public notice shall be published stating that the order
was issued and is available for review. Any such order shall be in writing.
   (B)   The City Council may take any steps that it is not prohibited from
taking by federal law to protect the public interest as part of any rate order
or by any other means. By way of illustration and not limitation, it may
require refunds, set rates, and impose forfeitures and penalties directly or
through its delegated representatives, and enforce refund orders. Any order
prescribing a rate must explain why the franchisee's proposed rate was
unreasonable and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However, before
prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to subscribers, the City Council shall
ensure the franchisee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed
rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the City Clerk/Treasurer propose a
refund or rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation to the franchisee at
the time it is submitted to City Council shall be deemed to provide the
franchisee this notice and the franchisee must comment on the refund or rate in
its response to the recommendations.
   (C)   No order approving or setting a rate using the FCC benchmark shall be
interpreted to establish the just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every
rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and refund
to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the same may
be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not limitation, should
the FCC reduce the benchmark, the city shall have the right to reduce a
franchisee's rates and to require the franchisee to refund any amounts
collected above the benchmark, except the extent prohibited by federal law.
(Ord. 93-10-21A, passed 10-21-93)
§ 64.053 FRANCHISEE'S DUTIES
   (A)   A franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including
prospective rate reductions and refunds, within sixty (60) days from the date
the City Council issues an order mandating a remedy.
   (B)   Within ninety (90) days of the date an order mandating a remedy is
issued, a franchise must file a certification, signed by an authorized
representative of the cable company stating:
      (1)   Whether the franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of
the City Council's order; and
      (2)   Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the
City Council's order; and
      (3)   Showing how refunds (including interest) were calculated and
distributed.
   (C)   It is each franchisee's responsibility to keep books and records of
account so that it can refund any amounts owed to subscribers.
   (D)   It is each franchisee's duty to submit as complete a filing as
possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing that is
incomplete under applicable law shall be treated as an evasion of this
subchapter.
   (E)   Information requests.
      (1)   A franchisee and any other entity that has records of revenues or
expenses that are allocated to the franchisee's system must respond to requests
for information from the city deadlines established by the city. A franchisee
is responsible for ensuring that such other entity responds to the city's
requests.
      (2)   Because federal law limits the time available for an intimal
response to a filing by a franchisee, before the order contemplated by §
64.051(B) issues, the franchisee must be prepared to respond to request for
information regarding its filing within five (5) days of the date an
information request is mailed to it. The information may include the
information the franchisee would be required to provide as part of any
supplementary filing.
(Ord. 93-10-21A, passed 10-21-93)
§ 64.054 DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATOR
   The City Administrator shall be responsible for administering the provisions
of this subchapter without limitation and by way of illustration:
   (A)   The City Administrator shall ensure notices are given to the public
and each franchisee as required herein and by FCC regulations.
   (B)   The City Administrator may submit requests for information to the
franchisee and establish deadlines for response to them, as provided in §
64.053.
   (C)   For good cause, the City Administrator may waive any provision herein
or extend any deadline for filing or response except as to such matters that
are mandatory under FCC regulations.
   (D)   The City Administrator shall rule on any request for confidentiality.
   (E)   The City Administrator shall prepare the recommendations to the City
Council contemplated by §§
64.051(B)-(C). If the City Administrator recommends that any increase be denied
in whole or in part, it shall:
      (1)   propose a rate and explain the basis for his recommendation (he may
propose that rates remain at existing levels); and
      (2)   recommend whether and on what basis refunds should issue; and
      (3)   notify the franchisee of its recommendation at the time it is
submitted to the Council.
(Ord. 93-10-21A, passed 10-21-93)
§ 64.055 PENALTIES; FORFEITURES
   Except as prohibited by federal law, a franchisee shall be subject to
penalties and forfeitures under the provisions of this chapter, and its request
for approval of a rate may be denied if it:
   (A)   Knowingly submits false or fraudulent information to the city in
connection with any rate proceeding;
   (B)   Fails to comply with any lawful order or request of the city,
including, but not limited to a request for information or an order setting
rates; or
   (C)   Evades or attempts to evade federal or local rate regulation; provided
that, filing for approval of a rate that is later determined to be unreasonable
is not in and of itself an evasion of federal or local rate regulation.
(Ord. 93-10-21A, passed 10-21-93)
§ 64.056 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION
   (A)   If these provisions, or any request for information requires the
production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the
information. However, at the time the alleged proprietary information is
submitted, a franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its
response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The
request must state the reason why the information should be treated as
proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for
confidentiality will be granted if the city determines that the preponderance
of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent with the provisions of
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552. The city shall place in a
public file for inspection any decision that results in information being
withheld. If the franchisee requests confidentiality and the request is denied,
(1) where the franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the
proposal, in which case the alleged proprietary information will be returned to
it; or (2) the franchisee may seek review within five (5) working days of the
denial in any appropriate form. Release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
   (B)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld
as proprietary with the City Administrator. The City Administrator shall weigh
the policy considerations favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited for
permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will
then promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable franchisee that
submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant,
deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the franchisee may seek
review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum.
Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.
(Ord. 93-10-21A, passed 10-21-93)
§ 64.057 PETITION FOR CHANGE IN STATUS
   Any franchisee may petition for a change in status in accordance with 47
C.F.R. § 76.915, and the city shall consider that petition in accordance with
47 C.F.R. § 76.915. The petition and ten (10) copies must be filed with the
City Clerk/Treasurer.

§ 65.001 GOALS; OBJECTIVES
   The intent of the Shelbyville Economic Development Fund (hereinafter
referred to as "SEDF" or "the Fund") is to provide financial incentives and
assistance to aid in the creation and retention of jobs and businesses in the
city. It is the goal of the SEDF to be as flexible as possible in providing
financial assistance with the overall aim of participating in transactions
having a reasonable likelihood of success, thus resulting in the preservation
of the financial health of the Fund.
(Ord. 87-006, passed 1-28-87)
§ 65.002 ORGANIZATION; OPERATION OF FUND
   (A)   Management of the Fund.
      (1)   The Mayor, with the approval of the City Council shall appoint a
Board of Management for the Fund, with each member serving a one (1) year term.
One (1) member shall be a City Council member; two (2) members shall be from
the public at large; and one (1) designee shall be appointed from each
participating bank. Upon the expiration of a member's term, the Mayor, with
approval of the City Council, may elect to renew the term for an additional
year. The Director of the Shelby Development Corporation shall serve as the
staff for the Board and act as liaison between potential applicants for
assistance from the Fund and the Board, as well as serving as the Board's
liaison with City Council. City Council has the final, exclusive obligation to
approve or disapprove any applications for assistance through the SEDF.
      (2)   In conjunction with the SEDF, participating local financial
institutions will create a loan pool to assist the Fund. One (1) representative
from each organization will serve on the Board of Management. The institutions
involved to date are Citizens Union, Republic Bank, Shelby County Trust and the
Bank of Shelbyville. The bank representatives must provide a unanimous vote to
approve the lending of bank funds. A veto of a loan application by the bank
members concerning bank funds cannot be overridden by City Council.
   (B)   Financial resources available to the Fund.
      (1)   The City Council may, from time to time as it deems appropriate,
allocate funds to the SEDF to be used by the Fund for the provision of
financial assistance to eligible business concerns. The Fund shall, at all
times, be discretionary city dollars which must be returned to the city upon
City Council's request. It is the goal of the SEDF that the Fund become self-
supporting through revenue realized from repayment of loans made from the Fund,
interest income from the investment of idle monies held by the Fund and the
infusion of any outside capital from other funding sources.
      (2)   Each financial institution participating in the loan pool will
provide the Shelby Development Corporation with a line of credit for twenty-
five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). Loans will be made at prime as noted in the
Courier-Journal. The bank fund will continue to revolve into other projects
until such time that the SEDF should dissolve, or the individual bank requests
its funds be returned.
      (3)   The intent of the combination of city and private dollars is to
increase the potential of the Fund. The SEDF is designed to allow these dollars
to increase the potential of the Fund and to allow these dollars to work
together to assist in developing projects which are deemed worthy by the Board
of Management, but would be unable to be undertaken without additional
assistance.
(Ord. 87-006, passed 1-28-87)
§ 65.003 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES
   (A)   Eligible projects.
      (1)   Land costs. Any related costs associated with the acquisition of
land or structures for industrial or commercial use.
      (2)   Building costs. Any costs related to the repair, renovation,
rehabilitation or construction of properties for industrial or commercial use.
      (3)   Machinery and equipment costs. Costs associated with the purchase,

      (4)   Infrastructure development costs. Costs required by a need to
install, construct or repair infrastructure facilities required for the
creation of new jobs of an industrial or commercial nature.
      (5)   Refinancing existing debt. Use of SEDF assistance for the purpose
of rescheduling existing debt in order to create or retain industrial and
commercial employers.
      (6)   Other project activities not specifically excluded below.
   (B)   Ineligible projects.
      (1)   Rolling stock, i.e., trucks, automobiles, etc.
      (2)   Capital equipment with a usable life of less than three (3) years.

      (5)   Assistance to business located outside the city limits.
   (C)   SEDF underwriting criteria.
      (1)   The Fund will rely on short term loans, secured by promissory
notes, liens and mortgages, as appropriate. Personal guarantees will be
required on all corporate loans, as appropriate.
      (2)   Financial assistance from the Fund will not exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the total project cost and all projects receiving assistance from the
Fund shall have a minimum equity position from the applicant of ten percent
(10%) of project costs. Equity shall be accepted on a "cash-in" basis only.
      (3)   Priority shall be given to applicants proposing to create or retain
one (1) job per two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) in assistance
provided by the Fund.
      (4)   The SEDF may make loans subordinated to other lenders and the terms
of any SEDF loans shall not exceed that of the first mortgage lender. This
decision can be waived if necessary.
      (5)   Rates and terms for each loan or other form of assistance provided
by the Fund shall be negotiated on an individual basis and provide adequate
flexibility to meet financial needs which vary from project to project.
      (6)   Priority shall be given to applicants proposing projects located
within the boundaries of the Shelbyville Historic District.
      (7)   A processing fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) will be charged
to all applicants to the Fund. This fee shall be charged only to those
applicants actually submitting an application for the review and consideration
of the SEDF Board of Management.
(Ord. 87-006, passed 1-28-87; Am. Ord. - -, passed 4-9-89)
§ 65.004 APPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS
   (A)   Initial application. An applicant wishing to have an application
reviewed by the SEDF Board will complete and submit an application to the
Director of the Shelby Development Corporation who will perform a preliminary
review of the document to assure that the nature of the project is eligible
under the terms of the program established by the SEDF. The second early review
step will be to ascertain the level of assistance requested from the Fund and
to verify that the Fund has adequate resources available to meet the request.
Finally, the Director will evaluate the application along with a recommendation
regarding the disposition of the application. Subject to Board acceptance, the
applicant will be advised that he has sixty (60) days to provide adequate
documentation that other funding sources required for the project are firmly
committed. An applicant submitting applications which are not accepted by the
Board will be advised of the Board's action and advised to seek funding from
another source. An applicant rejected by the Board for the SEDF dollars may
appeal to the City Council for its reassessment of the application.
   (B)   Board recommendation to City Council.  Subject to Board approval of
the initial application and subsequent demonstration of the applicant, within
sixty (60) days of the initial application approval, that all other funding
sources required for the project are in place, the Board may make a final
recommendation to the City Council that the application be approved. The
Director of the Shelby Development Corporation shall prepare a package of
information for City Council outlining the project to be acted upon and
outlining the criteria which led to the Board's action to recommend the project
for funding. Upon City Council action the SEDF will begin steps to close the
transaction to make financial assistance available through the Fund to the
applicant.
(Ord. 87-006, passed 1-28-87)
§ 65.005 TRANSACTION CLOSING PROCEDURES
   (A)   Final closing preparations. Upon City Council approval, the applicant
will be asked to execute assurances regarding the creation of jobs and
maintenance of records necessary to determine all representations made by the
applicant to the SEDF during the application process. At this time the Director
for the Shelby Development Corporation will prepare for execution by the SEDF,
the applicant and the city, an agreement specifying the terms of assistance
provided by the SEDF. Upon acceptance of the final application and execution of
the aforesaid agreement, the Director shall move to close the transaction
between the SEDF and the applicant.
   (B)   Transaction closing. The Director will engage an attorney acceptable
to the SEDF to prepare all loan documents, security instruments and other
items, such as title examination, for the closing and the Director shall
provide the attorney with all pertinent information about the transaction, in
writing, so as to assist the attorney in a prompt completion of these
documents. The SEDF shall appoint an attorney if the borrower does not specify
one. The SEDF closing will occur at the same time as any closing between the
applicant and any other superior lenders. All costs associated with document
preparation shall be paid by the recipient of the SEDF assistance and may be
withheld from the proceeds of any loan. Loan proceeds will be disbursed to the
recipient in accordance with terms and conditions previously negotiated with
the SEDF.
(Ord. 87-006, passed 1-28-87)
§ 65.006 PROJECT MONITORING
   (A)   Loan servicing. The SEDF will avoid, wherever possible, the actual
servicing of loans owned by the SEDF. It will be the position of the SEDF to
negotiate an arrangement with a local financial institution to act as the
recipient of any loan repayments generated by assistance made to applicants of
the Fund. The servicing institution will make quarterly reports to the SEDF
Board as to the payment history on all loans. The Fund Manager will negotiate
with the first lender for each project assisted by the Fund, for the first
lender to service the Fund's loan. Repayment proceeds from the Fund's loan will
be retained in an interest bearing account, available to the Fund on a demand
basis.
   (B)   Loan evaluation. Each six (6) months, the Director shall monitor the
projects assisted by the SEDF regarding the recipient's progress in meeting job
creation/retention goals established in agreements executed with the SEDF and
the city. Results of project evaluations shall be shared with the SEDF Board
and the City Council and any recommendations for remedial action required to
bring the activities of the SEDF loan recipient's operations into compliance
with agreed to performance schedules will be discussed.

ARTICLE I. PAWNBROKERS
§ 66.001 DEFINITIONS
   For the purpose of this article the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "HOLD." A full hold is placed on property which is known to be stolen. The

authorized by the officer placing the hold or the court. The property will
remain with the pawn shop pending adjudication of the case unless confiscated
by court order.
   "INVESTIGATIVE HOLD." A temporary hold placed on property suspected of being
stolen. The property under an investigative hold will not be sold by the pawn
shop. The officer placing such a hold must either release the hold or change it

hold. The purpose of the investigative hold is to make efforts to positively
identify the property as stolen.
   "PAWNBROKER." Any person who loans money on deposit of personal property;
deals in the purchase of personal property on condition of selling the property
back again at a stipulated price; makes a public display at his place of

The registry shall at all times be open to the inspection of any officer of the
state when in the discharge of his official duty.
   (B)   Every pawnbroker shall, by 11:00 a.m. each day, furnish to the Chief

   (B)   Remove section 103.5.
   (C)   Section 104: The following has been added:
      (1)   104.3.1: Certificate of occupancy required: Each rental dwelling
unit or other occupied property, excepting individual hotel and motel rooms,
shall have a valid and current certificate of occupancy issued in the name(s)
of the tenant(s) and property owner(s). Each certificate shall be considered
valid and current for three (3) years from the date of the final inspection or
until a change of owner(s) or tenant(s) occurs.
      (2)   104.3.2 Application for certificate of occupancy: No property for
which a certificate of occupancy is required shall be occupied prior to the
owner obtaining a valid and current certificate of occupancy for that property.
Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any structures subject to
the provisions of this chapter, the Code Enforcement Office of the city shall
inspect the property for which the certificate of occupancy is sought, and any
violations of the existing Property Maintenance Code shall be corrected. If the
individual unit to be inspected is currently occupied, and no certificate of
occupancy has been acquired on the property, the property owner is in violation
of this Section 104.3.2. If the individual unit to be inspected us currently
occupied and no certificate of occupancy has been acquired, or three (3) or
more years have passed since the last inspection, or there are obvious code
violations, or there have been complaints received on the property, then the
Code Enforcement Officer, authorized to enter the premises at reasonable times
to inspect, shall secure written permission from the occupant prior to entry
into the unit. If the occupant of the unit denies access, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall secure written permission and access from the property owner or
the property owner's agent. If the property owner or the property owner's agent
denies access, then the Code Enforcement Officer may seek an administrative
search warrant from the court having jurisdiction, or seek other remedies
available under law, prior to entering the unit. Any violations found upon
inspection are the responsibility of the owner of the property.
      (3)   104.3.2.2. Certificate of occupancy fee: A fee of twenty dollars
($20) shall be paid to the City of Shelbyville for each certificate of
occupancy. The fee is due immediately after the initial inspection is made. The
fee is good for the full three (3) year period unless ownership or tenant
occupancy changes, in which case the new owner must obtain a new certificate of
occupancy. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the fee has been
paid.
      (4)   104.4.1.
   (C)   Section 106.1 is amended as follows:

contrary to or in conflict with or in violation of any provisions of this code,
or fail to obey a lawful order of the code official, or to remove or deface a
placard or notice posted under the provisions of this code.

three (3) year certificate of occupancy and then reset at the start of a new or

that has been levied is uncontested and paid within seven (7) days then it
shall be reduced to an amount equaling fifty percent (50%) of the original
amount of the fine. Payment of a fine does not relieve the property owner from
correcting any and all violations.
   (D)   Section 107 is added as follows:
   107.6   Stop work orders: Upon notice from the code official that work on
any building or structure is being done contrary to this or any referenced
code, or in an unsafe or dangerous manner, such work shall be immediately
stopped. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the
owner of the property involved, or to the owners agent, or to the person doing
the work, or posted on the property and shall state the conditions under which
work will be permitted to resume.
   107.7   Unlawful continuance: A person who shall continue to work in, on, or
about the structure or property after being served with a stop work order
except the work that person is directed to perform to remove a violation or
unsafe condition, shall be guilty of a civil offense and be subject to the
penalty specified in 106.4.

72.001   Purpose
   
72.002   Definitions
   
72.003   Designation of historic districts, landmarks, and landmark sites
   
72.004   Changes to landmarks or property in historic districts; certificate of
appropriateness required
   
72.005   Maintenance, repair of landmarks or property in historic districts

72.999   Penalty
§ 72.001 PURPOSE
   (A)   The City Council finds that a major fire and other losses of buildings
downtown have resulted in concern about the future of the central business
district and that the city has begun a Main Street Program in cooperation with
the state government to help the central business district.
   (B)   The Council finds that many buildings have historic, architectural,
aesthetic, or cultural interest and value have been neglected, altered, or
destroyed notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of preserving and
continuing the use of such buildings and without adequate consideration of the
irreplaceable loss to the people of the city.
   (C)   The Council finds that neighborhoods and areas of the city have been
damaged and have deteriorated or are threatened because of new construction,
demolitions, alterations, and relocations that have harmed or will harm the
historic and architectural character of these neighborhoods and areas
notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of preserving and improving
these neighborhoods and areas through appropriate changes.
   (D)   The Council finds that the historic character of the central business
district is of vital importance in maintaining the economy of the city.
   (E)   The Council finds that the city has played an important role in the
development of Central Kentucky and that this growth is shown today through
buildings representing the activity as a governmental, agricultural, and
commercial center. The Council finds that the city has buildings, historic
sites, and areas that represent the persons who live and work or have lived and
worked in the city during its first 190 years. It is the finding of the City
Council that the distinctive and significant character of this city can only be
maintained by protecting and enhancing its historic, architectural, aesthetic,
and cultural heritage and by preventing unnecessary injury or destruction of
its landmarks and historic districts which are civic and community assets.
   (F)   The Council finds that the federal and Kentucky governments have
passed laws to protect and preserve landmarks and historic districts, that some
of these laws provide incentives for historic preservation, and that the
National Historic Preservation Act was amended in 1980 to establish a certified
local government program creating a new federal-state-local partnership to

this city, state, and nation. The Council declares as a matter of public policy
that this chapter is required in the interest of the health, prosperity,
safety, welfare, and economic well-being of the people.
   (I)   The purpose of this chapter is to effect the goals as set forth in the
above findings and declarations of public policy and specifically, but not
exclusively, to do the following.
      (1)   Effect and accomplish the preservation, protection, perpetuation
and use of historic districts, landmarks, and landmark sites having a special
or distinctive character or a special historic, architectural, aesthetic, or
cultural interest and value to the city, state, and nation.

the people and safeguard the city's history and heritage as embodied and
reflected in such landmarks, sites, and districts.
      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values in such districts and in the
city as a whole.
      (4)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable accomplishments of the
past.

§ 72.003 DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC DISTRICTS, LANDMARKS, AND LANDMARK SITES
   (A)   The Historic District Commission shall recommend to the City Council
the designation of individual landmarks and landmark sites and historic
districts, and the City Council may make these designations by the enactment of
ordinances.
   (B)   Consideration of the designation of a landmark and landmark site or a
historic district may be originated by the Commission or by the filing of an
application for designation by a property owner, any resident of the city, or
any organization in the city. A person or an organization proposing a
designation shall give the Commission the names and addresses of the owners of
the affected property and the owners of all adjoining property as listed on the
tax rolls of the city.
   (C)   The Commission shall assemble information about a property or district
being considered for designation and shall schedule a public hearing on the
proposed designation. Advertised notice of the hearing shall be given,
including conspicuous posting in the property or in the proposed district. At
least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing written notice shall be
given by first class mail to the owners of property under consideration and the
owners of all adjoining property. The secretary of the Historic District
Commission or other officer of the Commission shall certify that the notices
were mailed. Written notice shall be considered sufficient when it is mailed to
the person listed on the tax rolls of the city.
   (D)   Before its public hearing on a designation, the Commission shall adopt
general guidelines that will apply to the city's landmarks and historic
districts and will assist owners in the preservation and rehabilitation of
their property. The general guidelines shall include the Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings and other guidelines that will apply to all designated
property in the city. Before each public hearing on a designation, the
Commission may adopt additional guidelines that will supplement the general
guidelines and will apply to the property under consideration if it is
designated. The guidelines shall not limit new construction to any one
architectural style but shall seek to preserve the character and integrity of
the landmark of the historic district. The guidelines shall suggest changes
that would be appropriate for landmarks or for property in historic districts.
After a designation, the Commission may expand or amend the guidelines it has
adopted provided it holds a public hearing on the changes and submits the
proposed changes to the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council for
their comments.
   (E)   A landmark or historic district shall qualify for designation when it
meets one (1) or more of the following criteria which shall be discussed in a
Commission report making its recommendations to the City Council.
      (1)   Its value as a reminder of the cultural or archeological heritage
of the city, state, or nation.
      (2)   Its location as a site of a significant local, state, or national
event.
      (3)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the city, state, or nation.
      (4)   Its identification as the work of a master builder, designer, or
architect whose individual work has influenced the development of the city,
state, or nation.
      (5)   Its value of a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that retains sufficient elements showing its architectural
significance.
      (6)   Its distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style
valuable for the study of a period, method of construction, or use of
indigenous materials.
      (7)   Its character as a geographically definable area possessing a
significant concentration, or continuity of sites, buildings, objects, or
structures united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical
development.
      (8)   Its character as an established and geographically definable
neighborhood, united by culture, architectural style, or physical plan and
development.
   (F)   After evaluating the testimony at its public hearing, survey
information, and other material it has assembled, the Commission shall make its
recommendation to the City Council with a written report on the property or
area under consideration. The report shall contain information about
significant buildings, structures, established trees and other site
characteristics included in the proposed designation.
   (G)   The Commission shall notify each owner of the decision relating to his
property and shall arrange that the designation of a property as a landmark or
as a part of a historic district be recorded in the land records of the county.
The Commission shall ask that fees be waived for the city documents recording
the designations. The Commission shall also give notice of the decision to the
government offices in the city and county which shall retain them for future

§ 72.004 CHANGES TO LANDMARKS OR PROPERTY IN HISTORIC DISTRICTS; CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED
   (A)   A certificate of appropriateness from the Historic District Commission
shall be required before a person may undertake the following actions described
in subdivisions (1) through (4) herein affecting a landmark, a landmark site,
or a property in a historic district. No application fee shall be required for
a certificate of appropriateness that is timely filed. Any applicant or person
who files for application after such applicant or person has begun alteration,
new construction, demolition or relocation has begun on the landmark, landmark
site, or property in a historic district for which the certificate of
appropriateness is being sought, will be required to have any subsequent
application heard before the Historic District Commission and required to pay a
fifty dollar ($50.00) application fee to cover administrative costs.
      (1)   Alteration of the exterior part of a building or structure that is
visible to the public including changes to a sign or the installation of a new
sign and the cutting down of an established tree that is visible to the public,
or the installation of a fence that is visible to the public.
      (2)   New construction.
      (3)   Demolition. Demolition shall include demolition by neglect as
defined in §
72.002.
      (4)   Relocation.
   (B)   A person shall be referred to the Commission by the Historic District
Coordinator or Building Inspector when he wants to undertake an exterior
alteration visible to the public, new construction, demolition or relocation
affecting a landmark, a landmark site, or a property in a historic district.
The person shall supply the Commission with the information it requests in
order to decide his application for a certificate of appropriateness. The
applicant shall provide, where applicable, drawings of the proposed work,
photographs of the existing building or structure or site and adjacent
properties, and information about the building materials to be used. No
building permits, zoning permits, certificates of occupancy or demolition
permits shall be issued by the District Coordinator or Building Inspector
unless the application is accompanied by a certificate of appropriateness,
except in the case of emergency conditions as provided in paragraph (M) of this
section. In the event work is being performed without the required certificate
of appropriateness, the Commission shall ask that a Stop Work Order be issued.
In the event work is being performed which is not in accordance with such
certificate, the Police Chief or the City Clerk/Treasurer shall issue a Stop
Work Order and any law enforcement officer may cite violators in District
Court. All work shall cease on the designated property. No additional work
shall be undertaken as long as such Stop Work Order shall continue in effect.
The city may apply in Circuit Court for an injunction to enforce its Stop Work
Order.
   (C)   (1)   The Commission shall review at a regular monthly public meeting
each application for certificate of appropriateness within thirty (30) days
after a completed application is received by the Commission except for
applications which are staff-approvable as provided in paragraph (F). The
Commission shall make a decision on the application within forty-five (45) days
after the receipt of a completed application provided that the Commission may
extend the time for decision an addition sixty (60) days when the application
is for demolition or new construction. The Commission shall approve or
disapprove each application, and it shall give its reasons for its decision
using the criteria contained in this section and in its guidelines. The
Commission may suggest modifications to an application and may then approve a
certificate of appropriateness providing for revisions in the plans submitted.
If the Commission fails to decide on an application within the specified time
period, the application shall be deemed approved unless the applicant and the
Commission have agreed in writing to an extension. Applicants shall be given
notice of the public hearings and meeting relating to their application and
shall be informed of the Commission's decision.
      (2)   Following the initial disapproval of any application, there shall
be a ninety (90) day negotiation period during which no appeal may be taken.
During this period the Commission and the applicant shall continue negotiations
in an effort to agree upon an alternative which will comply with the
Commission's guidelines. The Commission, after notice to the applicant, may
hold additional hearings and hear additional evidence, and may reconsider its
initial disapproval. All of these actions shall become a part of the
administrative record.
      (3)   A certificate of appropriateness shall remain valid for one (1)
year after it is issued. Work is required to start before the end of the one
(1) year period. If the approved work has not been completed within two (2)
years after the certificate of appropriateness was issued, the Commission shall
review the situation and may require an application for a certificate of
appropriateness for the work that remains to be done.
   (D)   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall be aware
of the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the applicant.
The Commission shall also recognize the importance of approving plans that will
be reasonable for the applicant to carry out. Before an applicant prepares his
plans, he may bring a tentative proposal to the Commission for its comments.
The Commission shall prepare a list of routine alterations that shall receive
immediate approval from its staff without a public meeting when an applicant
complies with the specifications of the Commission. The list shall include
paint colors appropriate for different types of buildings.
   (E)   In reviewing applicants involving signs, the Commission shall use
guidelines it has prepared that have been approved by the City Council. Owners
and tenants shall apply to the Commission before their signs are made.
   (F)   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark, a building or
structure on a landmark site, or a building or structure in a historic
district, the Commission shall negotiate with the applicant to see if an
alternative to demolition can be found. The Commission may ask interested
individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to
demolition and in obtaining estimates on seeking an alternative to demolition
and in obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs for the threatened building.
After its public meeting, the Commission may decide that a building or
structure in a historic district or on a landmark site may be demolished
because it does not contribute to the historic district or to the landmark. On
all other demolition applications, the Commission shall study the question of
economic hardship for applicant and shall determine whether the landmark or the
property in the historic district can be put to reasonable beneficial use
without the approval of the demolition application. In the case of an income-
producing building, the Commission shall also determine whether the applicant
can obtain a reasonable return from his existing building. The Commission may
ask applicants for additional information to be used in making these
determinations. These determinations shall be in addition to the points
contained in subsection (E) of §
72.003 above. If economic hardship or the lack of a reasonable return is not
proved, the Commission shall deny the demolition application unless the
Commission finds grounds to grant the demolition application under the points
contained in subsection (E) of §
72.003 above.
   (G)   When the applicant wishes to move a landmark, a building or structure
on a landmark site, or a building or structure in a historic district or wishes
to move a building or structure to a landmark site or to a property in a
historic district, the Commission shall consider the following.
      (1)   The contribution the building or structure makes to its present
setting.
      (2)   Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated.
      (3)   Whether the building or structure can be moved without significant
damage to its physical integrity.
      (4)   The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed site
and adjacent properties. These considerations shall be in addition to the
points contained in subsection (E) above.
   (H)   The applicant shall have an appeal to the Circuit Court from a
decision of the Commission on an application for a certificate of
appropriateness.
   (I)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a landmark, a landmark
site, or a property in a historic district does not change its exterior
appearance that is visible to the public.
   (J)   An owner shall immediately notify the Building Inspector of emergency
conditions dangerous to life, health, or property affecting a landmark, a
landmark site, or a property in a historic district, and the owner shall
promptly provide evidence of the dangerous conditions that has been prepared by
a person with professional qualifications in evaluating buildings and
structures.
   (K)   In any case where the Building Inspector determines that there are
emergency conditions dangerous to life, health, or property affecting a
landmark, a landmark site, or a property in a historic district, he may order
the remedying of these conditions without the approval of the Commission. The
Building Inspector shall promptly notify the Chairman of the Commission of the
action being taken.
   (L)   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall
conform to the provisions of the certificate. It shall be the responsibility of
the Building Inspector to inspect from time to time any work being performed to
assure such compliance. In the event work is being performed which is not in
accordance with the certificate, the Police Chief or the City Clerk/Treasurer
shall issue a stop work order and any law enforcement officer may cite
violators in District Court. All work shall cease on the designated property.
No additional work shall be undertaken as long as the stop work order shall
continue in effect. The city may apply in Circuit Court for an injunction to
enforce its stop work order.

      (2)   All interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may
cause the buildings or structures to deteriorate or to become damaged or
otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair.
   (B)   The purpose of this section is to prevent a person from forcing the
demolition of his building by neglecting it and permitting damage to the
building by weather or vandalism. No provision in this chapter shall be
interpreted to require an owner or tenant to undertake an alteration or to
restore his building to its original appearance.
   (C)   The Historic District Commission shall request a meeting with a
property owner when his landmark or his building in a historic district is in
poor repair, and the Commission shall discuss with the owner ways to improve
the condition of his property. After this step the Commission may request the
Building Inspector to take action to require correction of defects in any
building or structure designated under this chapter so that the building or
structure shall be preserved in accordance with the purposes of this chapter.
The action taken by the city may include boarding up the doors, windows, and
other parts of the building, and additional steps to stabilize walls, roofs,
and other parts of a building.
   (D)   The applicant shall have a direct appeal to the Circuit Court from a
decision of the Commission on an application for a certificate of
appropriateness regarding a sign. On all other applications for a certificate
of appropriateness, the applicant must first appeal to the City Council. The
appeal must be filed with the City Clerk/Treasurer within thirty (30) days
after the expiration of the ninety (90) day waiting period. The City Council
shall have forty-five (45) days following the filling of the appeal with the
City Clerk/Treasurer during which to render a decision on the appeal. If the
City Council's decision is adverse to the applicant, or if the City Council
fails to act within this time period, the applicant shall then have an appeal
to the Circuit Court.
   (E)   The provisions of this section shall be in addition to all other
provisions of the Kentucky Building Code requiring buildings and structures to
be kept in good repair.

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 74.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS 82.082 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council hereby adopts the following floodplain management
ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.002 FINDINGS OF FACT
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Shelbyville are subject to periodic
inundations which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.004 OBJECTIVES
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.005 DEFINITIONS
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter it's most reasonable application.
   "A ZONE." Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In "A ZONES", floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   "ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE)." A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principle structure. "ACCESSORY STRUCTURES" should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   "ACCESSORY USE." A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   "ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE)." Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common

interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator's ruling on a request for a variance.
   "AR/AI - A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AND AR/A ZONES." Special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited
flood protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a
100-year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete
these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding
sources.
   "A99 ZONE." That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system
under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.

has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   "BASEMENT." That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four (4) sides.
   "BUILDING." A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground,
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for "STRUCTURE".
   "C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES." Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   "COMMUNITY." A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce

engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   "FLOODWAY." The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.
Also referred to as the "regulatory floodway".
   "FLOODWAY FRINGE." That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   "FREEBOARD." A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. "FREEBOARD" must be applied
not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also
to the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
   "FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION." As related in §§
74.050 through
74.057, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50)
to one hundred (100) years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed
below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased
risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the
community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and
suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future
owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood
damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   "FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY." A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located

health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   "HAZARD POTENTIAL." The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   "HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE." The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   "HISTORIC STRUCTURE." Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a

states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of

approved programs.
   "INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC)."
      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the cost to
elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.

county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the Cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the Cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to require
approval by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
subsection (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
Cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.

(FIRMS), other supporting data and any subsequent amendments thereto, are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations by
Shelbyville, and for those land areas acquired by Shelbyville through
annexation. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability
of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow
implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by
the Floodplain Administrator and are enacted by City Council pursuant to
statutes governing land use management regulations. The FIS and/or FIRM are
permanent records of Shelbyville and are on file and available for review by
the public during regular business hours at Shelbyville City Hall.

or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See subsection
(C) herein.
   (C)   Notice of citation.  If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven (7) days of the date the
citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven (7) days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.

ARTICLE II. ADMINISTRATION
§ 74.020 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR
   The City Council hereby appoints the Mayor or designee to administer,
implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting or denying
development permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein referred
to as the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.021 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
74.007. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by the Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade;
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to MSL to which any non-residential
structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§
74.031(B) and
74.033(B); or
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to Mean Sea Level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.031 SPECIFIC STANDARDS
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
74.007, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction.  New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor; including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower
than at or above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with
standards of subsection (C) of this section.
      (1)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth
number is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated at or above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be produced.
Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060,
states as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit:
The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries
(and thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where
FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
(0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated at or above the base flood elevation.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor
including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection department to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction.  New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with subsection (A) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation at or above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than at or above the level of the base flood
elevation; or
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
74.021(A)(3).
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in subsection (D) of
this section.
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation at or above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin I-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two (2) openings with a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures.  New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and,
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and,
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's flood

upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result
of a flood.
         (b)   All manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than at or above the
level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
so that either the:
            1.   Lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than at or above the level of the base flood elevation; or
            2.   Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than
thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-30,
AO, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must either:

wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways.  Located within areas of special flood hazard established
in § 74.007, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge:
         (a)   If this subsection (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 5.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.032 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION

where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
74.007.

74.007, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate: therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the flood insurance rate map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,

elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one (1) foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
74.031(B).
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.034 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS
   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available
(Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.

ARTICLE IV. APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 74.050 NATURE OF VARIANCES
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.

(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.052 DUTIES OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD
   (A)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations

(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.053 APPEALS/VARIANCE PROCEDURES
   In passing upon such applications, the Appeals Board shall consider all

transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and,
   (K)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.054 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES
   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
chapter, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (A)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard.
"Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard. In
the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be made that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic
character and design of the structure.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood height, additional threats to public safely, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
74.005 under "PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE"), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in §
74.005) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administration shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
   (G)   Variance may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of §
74.053 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.055 VARIANCE NOTIFICATION
   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that:
   (A)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
   (B)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Shelbyville Recorder and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.056 HISTORIC STRUCTURES
   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (see §
74.005) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.057 NO IMPACT CERTIFICATION WITHIN THE FLOODWAY
   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. 2009-08-20(A), passed 8-20-09)
§ 74.999 PENALTY
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more
than ninety (90) days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
Floodplain Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violation.
