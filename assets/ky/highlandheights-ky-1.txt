   (B)   Landmark trees:
      (1)   Designate and maintain records of landmark trees on city property,
excluding the Nature Trail. A citizen may apply to have a tree on his or her
property designated as a landmark tree. A tree may qualify as a landmark tree
if it meets one or more of the following criteria:
         (a)   The tree species is rare;
         (b)   The tree is more than 100 years of age;
         (c)   The tree has been connected with a significant historical event;
         (d)   The tree is of an outstanding trunk diameter or drip line
diameter for a tree of its species;
         (e)   The quality of the tree foliage is outstanding for a tree of its
species; and/or

features or scenic enhancement of such tree is of special importance to the

tree’s designation, number, species, age and periodic monitoring.
      (3)   If the owner or owners of the property on which a landmark tree is
located consent thereto, the Commission may identify such tree as a landmark
tree. The owner or owners may choose to have a suitable marker placed thereon.
The cost of the marker shall be underwritten by the property owner.
      (4)   Prior to the removal of any designated landmark tree, the
Commission may suggest alternate building areas in an effort to preserve said
landmark tree. If and when any landmark tree is removed, the Commission shall
arrange for the necessary changes to be made to the official landmark tree
inventory records and the city map.
   (C)   The Commission shall prepare and submit a list of trees to the city
staff suitable for planting in public right-of-way areas that are conducive to
growth in the Greater Cincinnati region. All trees located on property owned by
the city or on a public right-of-way shall be maintained by the city. The
Commission may be consulted with regard to the selection, location and planting
of trees that are to be placed on city property or right-of-way. When
consulted, the Commission shall check to ensure no underground utilities exist
in the area where a tree is to be planted.
   (D)   (1)   The Commission shall bring to the attention of the city staff
any tree on city property that represents a threat to public safety when such
tree is dead or dying and its presence would cause hardship or endanger the
public or an adjoining property owner. The Commission shall also notify the
city when a tree on city property is diseased or infested so as to be a danger
to other trees within the city. Further, the staff shall be notified by the
Commission when a tree is considered a hazard because it obstructs the view of
motor vehicle operations or otherwise interferes with traffic or pedestrian
safety. In the event the complete removal of a tree is not required, it may be
pruned pursuant to the requirements contained herein.
      (2)   Members of the Commission will participate in the review and
development of the city’s Comprehensive Plan. Whenever development is to occur
on city property affecting trees, members of the Commission are encouraged to
attend the Planning and Zoning meetings and make recommendations to the city
that will minimize the impact on said trees. Tree Commission recommendations
should encourage tree conservation whenever practical, or provide advice as to
when tree removal is more feasible. In determining whether tree removal may be
necessary, the Commission should consider:
         (a)   Whether the presence of such tree would cause hardship or
endanger the public or an adjoining property owner;
         (b)   Whether such tree is located in an area to be occupied by
buildings, driveways, recreation areas or other construction or within the drip
line of a tree; and
         (c)   Whether such tree is located in an area to have a cut or fill of
land that may be injurious or dangerous to such tree.
   (E)   Any public utility serving the city with overhead services shall have
the right to remove trees on city property, without the prior approval of the
city, only when an emergency exists and when obtaining the prior approval of
the city and/or Tree Commission is not practical. All public utilities with
overhead services shall coordinate all non-emergency tree trimming activities
with the city staff and/or Tree Commission that are reasonably required for the
purpose of providing the appropriate utility service or to avoid danger to the
public, overhead utility personnel or equipment pursuant to the requirements
contained in the franchise agreements as authorized by the City Council of the
city. Any other person(s) or firm, except the public utility with overhead
lines having line clearing operations (tree trimming) done by it or, for it by
any person(s) or firm shall first obtain written approval from the city and/or
Tree Commission. Any person may appeal a decision of the Tree Commission
regarding a tree removal request to the City Council. Such appeal shall be made
in writing and received by the City Clerk within the time frame for appeal as
stated herein. The City Council, in the consideration of any appeal, will give
much deference to the decision of the Tree Commission and will render a
decision, to a large extent, based upon an examination of the minutes, records
and proceedings of the Commission. The City Council shall act upon all appeals
within 30 days from the date of the appeal.

§ 37.40 DEMOLITION OF PROPERTY.
   (A)   Demolition orders generally. A Code Enforcement Officer shall order
the owner of a premises to demolish and remove a structure located thereon, or
if such structure is capable of being made safe by repairs, to repair and make
safe and sanitary or to demolish and remove at the owner’s option, when, in the
opinion of the Code Enforcement Officer:
      (1)    Imminent danger exists on the subject property that necessitates
immediate action, or there is reason to believe that the existence of a
violation of this section with respect to the structure presents a serious
threat to the public health, safety, and welfare; or
      (2)    The structure is so old, dilapidated, or has become so out of
repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human
habitation or occupancy, or demolition is otherwise reasonably necessary to
protect the public interest.
   (B)    Order. The order shall specify necessary repairs, if any, and a time
in which the owner shall comply therewith, which shall be no less than 30 days
unless an emergency exists pursuant to division (A)(1) above. It shall be
served on the owner of record in accordance with this chapter.
   (C)   Hearing prior to demolition by city. 
      (1)   Except when an imminent danger exists that will not permit delay,
whenever the owner of a property fails to comply with a demolition order within
the time prescribed, the Code Enforcement Board shall act as a Hearing Officer
and shall conduct a hearing prior to the city undertaking demolition of the
structure.
      (2)   The Hearing Officer shall issue a notice of hearing informing the
property owner of the date, time, and location of the hearing. The hearing
shall be held not less than seven days from the date the notice of hearing is
issued. The notice of hearing shall be served on the owner of record by

answer with the City Clerk and/or appear in person to present testimony or
other evidence of why the structure should not be demolished. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall present testimony or other evidence demonstrating why
the structure should be demolished. The burden of proof shall be upon the Code
Enforcement Officer to demonstrate by substantial evidence that demolition is
authorized by division (A) above.
      (4)   The property owner may waive his or her right to a hearing and
authorize the city to undertake demolition of the structure. The owner’s
failure to appear at the hearing after proper notice shall constitute a waiver,
unless good cause is shown.
      (5)   Upon a showing by substantial evidence that demolition of the
structure is authorized by division (A) above, or upon waiver of hearing by the
property owner, the Hearing Officer shall enter an order to that effect and
order demolition of the structure by the city.
      (6)   The order shall be served on the owner of record and any lien
holder of record within 14 days of the final determination, whether after
hearing or upon waiver of hearing. If there is a lien holder of record, that
lien holder may, within 45 days from the receipt of that notice, correct the
violations cited or elect to pay all fines, penalty charges, and costs incurred
in remedying the situation as permitted.
      (7)   Anyone affected by an order issued pursuant to division (C)(5)
above may, after service of such order, apply to Campbell Circuit Court for an
order restraining the Code Enforcement Officer from razing such structure.
   (D)   Demolition by city. Upon final determination that the structure shall
be demolished by the city, or when an imminent danger exists that will not
permit the delay associated with a hearing, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
cause the structure to be razed and removed, either through an available public
agency or by contract or arrangement with private persons, and the cost of such
razing and removal, together with related expenses, costs, fees, and attorney
fees to the extent provided by law, shall be charged against the owner of the
real estate upon which the structure is located. Upon failure of the owner to
effect payment of such costs, a lien shall be placed by the city against the
real estate upon which the razed or removed structure was located pursuant to
city regulations.
   (E)    Appeals. Any person directly affected by an order under this section
shall have the right to appeal to the Code Enforcement Board within thirty days
of the demolition order in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (F)   Remedies not exclusive. Nothing in the section shall prohibit the city
or any of its officers from proceeding under any other applicable section of
this chapter or any other applicable chapter, including, but not limited to,
issuing a citation and/or bringing a separate action before the Code
Enforcement Board, in order to abate any condition described by this section.

   (C)   Any intersection deemed by the city to be of special or critical
importance to the movement of traffic shall be marked in a distinctive manner
in order to indicate its importance. Should the operator of any vehicle enter
any intersection so marked when there is insufficient room on the other side of
the intersection to accommodate the vehicle, the indication of any traffic-

division (C) rather than division (B) above.
(1992 Code, § 71.01) Penalty, see §
71.999

this section when signs are in place giving notice of such speed limit.

5-2008; Ord. 15-2019, passed 12-3-2019)
§ 110.04 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) below, gross receipts shall be
apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the gross receipts by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) below, and the
denominator of which is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the gross receipts by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) below.
      (3)   For the purpose of divisions (A) through (E) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the city.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.      
      (2)   Sales revenue, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent, performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of gross receipts.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage that the compensation
for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to the total
wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to verify the
accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this division (E), the
taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations and all other entities where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
“passed through” these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

12-6-2005)
§ 110.05 EMPLOYERS TO WITHHOLD.
   (A)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee shall
deduct and withhold upon the payment of the compensation an occupational
license tax calculated under §
110.03 imposed against the compensation by the city. Amounts withheld shall be
paid to the city in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter ending
thereafter, on or before the end of the month following the close of each
quarter, make a return and report to the city, and pay to the city, the tax
required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or
required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the city.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any sums
required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to be
withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational
license tax withheld where compensation is paid or payable to employees. Either
copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax statements, or
a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the city, shall be submitted.
   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or before
January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee
for payment to the city during the preceding calendar year.
   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (H)   The president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this section shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
section unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for, or
pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes imposed by
this chapter become or became due.
   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H) above, every employee receiving
compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
110.03 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee,
such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the city each
quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer or as otherwise
required by the city. If an employer fails to or is not required to withhold,
report or pay the license tax it shall become the duty of the employee to file
with the city. The only employer that is not required to withhold, report and
pay the occupational license tax is the federal government including the United
States Postal Service. The payment required to be made by an employee can be
made quarterly, for the periods ending March 31, June 31, September 30 and
December 31 of each year, or at any time the employee wishes to make an
estimated payment for the year in which wages are earned. All license fees must
be received by February 28 for the preceding calendar year, together with a
copy of the employee’s W-2 form. Employers not required to withhold, report or
pay the license tax must annually, during the month of January of each year,
make a return to the city, in which is set forth the name and Social Security
number of each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar year,
giving the amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation earned
during such preceding year by each such employee. This list shall include all
current full time employees, part-time employees, temporary employees and
terminated employees whether it be voluntary or involuntary.

§ 110.06 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (A)   All business entity returns for the preceding taxable year shall be

city.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax

thereof that have not been previously filed. The city may also require copies
of reports of adjustments made by the federal government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to a occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns and comply with rules as the city from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems sufficient to
determine the tax liability of the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the taxable income
of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business
entity or of any other person having knowledge on the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity, as
appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the city at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return, determined without
regard to any extension of time for filing the return.
   (F)   Every business entity making payments of $600 or more to persons other
than employees for services performed within the city is responsible for
maintaining the records of those payments and for completing IRS Form 1099 on
or before February 28 of the year following the close of the calendar year in
which such compensation was paid and to remit copies of the IRS Form 1099 or
equivalent information to the city on or before February 28 of each year.

return, if the business entity, on or before the date prescribed for payment of
the occupational license tax, requests in writing the extension and pays the
amount properly estimated as its tax. Extension request forms shall be supplied
by the city.
   (B)   If the time for filing a return is extended, the business entity shall
pay, as part of the tax, an amount equal to 12% per annum simple interest on
the tax shown due on the return, but not been previously paid, from the time

overpayment was made no refund or credit shall be allowed. Where there has been
an overpayment of the maximum tax due under §
110.05, a refund or credit shall be made to the employee to the extent of
overpayment only if a written application for refund is received by the city

      (1)   In the case of a failure to file a return or of a fraudulent return

      (4)   Violation of any provision of this subchapter shall be grounds for

      (5)   The issuance of such permit does not vest any property right in the

with the terms and conditions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Application requirements. An initial applicant for a permit under the
provisions of this subchapter shall file with the City Clerk-Treasurer a
written application on a form provided for that purpose which shall be signed
and verified by the applicant, who shall be the proprietor of the business
sought to be licensed. A separate application must be filed for each location
sought to be permitted. The following information is required in the
application:
      (1)   The name, age, address, telephone number and residence of each
applicant and if there be more than one and they are partners, the partnership
name, address or, if doing business under an assumed name, the name under which
such business is intended to be conducted;
      (2)   The name and address of each person interested or to become
interested in the business for which the permit is sought, together with the
nature of that interest, and if the applicant is a corporation, the names,
addresses and ages of each officer, director and managerial employee, and the
state under the laws of which the corporate applicant is incorporated. The City
Clerk-Treasurer may, at his or her discretion, require also the names of all
stockholders;
      (3)   The premises for which a permit is sought, stating the street and
number, if the premises has a street number, and otherwise such a description
as will reasonably indicate the location of the premises. The applicant shall
also state the nature of the interest in the premises and the name, or the
associate, who is interested with the applicant either in the premises or in
the business to be licensed;
      (4)   (a)   A statement that neither the applicant nor any other person
referred to in this subchapter has been convicted of any felony, within two
years preceding his or her application; and that he or she has not had any
similar permit issued to him or her revoked for cause within two years prior to
the date of his or her application. It shall be the duty of the Chief of Police
to investigate the criminal record of the applicant, if any, before affixing
his or her signature of approval to the application. His or her signature shall
constitute verification that to the best of his or her knowledge at the time of
initial application the applicant has not violated any of the provisions of
this subchapter.
         (b)   If the Chief of Police shall find such violation of this
subchapter to exist, he or she shall immediately notify the City Clerk-
Treasurer of the same and refuse to sign the application, such shall be
sufficient grounds for denial of the requested permit.
         (c)   In the event that the applicant shall, at any time, be found to
have made any false statement or material omission on the application, the same
shall constitute grounds for immediate revocation of the license or permit
issued hereunder.
      (5)   The name, address and phone number of the manager or operator of
the premises to be permitted if such person is not the proprietor;
      (6)   (a)   The signature of not less than ten owner/occupiers of real
estate parcels, within a radius of 200 feet of the place in which the game room
shall be operated signifying their consent or acquiescence to the operation of
such business; provided, however, that if there are less than ten owner/
occupiers of real estate parcels located within such radius, then such
application shall contain the signatures of not less than two-thirds of all the
owner/occupiers of real estate parcels within such prescribed distance.
         (b)   An owner/occupier of real estate parcel under this subchapter
shall be construed as one individual person who is vested the ownership or
title or partial ownership or title to the real estate parcel within the
prescribed radius and who is also an actual occupier living within the
residence or structure location upon the real estate parcel within the
prescribed radius. Any owner of a real estate parcel within the prescribed
radius who does not actually reside upon the said parcel or any occupier of the
residence or structure upon the said parcel who does not own or partially own
the same shall not qualify as an appropriate signer on the application.
         (c)   It is imperative that the conditions set forth above shall be
met. There shall only be one individual person (owner/occupier) permitted to
sign for each real estate parcel within the prescribed radius. A husband and
wife or any joint owners of a parcel of real estate shall be considered as one
individual person under this section and shall be permitted to sign only once
as the owner/occupier for the entire parcel of real estate located within the
prescribed radius.
         (d)   Furthermore, any person or persons who may own more than one
parcel of real estate within the prescribed radius shall hereby be expressly
prohibited from signing more than once on any application regardless of the
total number of parcels of real estate he or she may own within the prescribed
radius.
         (e)   The measurement of the prescribed radius, that being 200 feet,
shall be taken in a straight line from and to the nearest points of the
respective properties.
      (7)   The signature of the owner/occupier of the premises where the game
room shall be operated;
      (8)   If, after a permit has been issued, there is a change in any of the
facts required to be set forth in the application, a verified supplemental
statement in writing giving notice of the change shall be filed with the City
Clerk-Treasurer within ten days after the change. The word “change” with
reference to corporate licensees is construed to include any change of
directors or officers of the corporation, or a change in ownership of stock
whereby any person secures 10% of the outstanding stock or effects a transfer
of said percentage of stock; transfer of more than 10% of the total stock shall
require a new license;
      (9)   Such other information as the City Clerk-Treasurer may require. Any
such information shall be conclusively presumed to be correct and shall be
deemed material in any subsequent prosecutions; and
      (10)   Advertising and signature requirements under these provisions
shall be required of all initial permit applicants and for all transfers, but
shall not apply to permit renewals. The City Clerk-Treasurer may refuse to
approve issuance or renewal of a permit for failure to comply with any of the
above stated provisions.
(1992 Code, § 113.12)

during the policy term, the tax rate used shall be the rate in effect on the

outside the legal corporate limits of the city which was paid the license fee
or tax, the insurance company or agent shall be refunded those license fees and
taxes within 90 days of notice to the city paid.
      (2)   License fees which are not paid on or before the due date shall
bear interest at the tax interest rate as defined in KRS 131.010(6) from the
date due until paid. Such interest payable to the city is separate from
penalties provided for in KRS 91A.080(7). In addition, the city may assess a

section, the lien shall be a priority over liens of prior record and the lien
will be effective on the date the city incurs the costs of repairs as provided
in state statutes.
   (C)   Bond. The mortgagee may post a bond in an amount equal to the cost of
abatement of the code violations which may include repair or demolition. The
mortgagee must submit to the Code Official written cost estimates by

Official will establish the bond amount based upon the submitted cost
estimates. The Code Official may extend the compliance date up to 90 days if a
