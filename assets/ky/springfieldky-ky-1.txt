Revolving Loan Fund represents one effort to achieve this goal. Since the
monies in this Fund are limited, objectives of the City Council are to approve
projects that are sound and capable of repaying their loan and to maximize
earnings through investment. These objectives will help maintain and ensure the
growth of the Fund for use by future prospective businesses.

liaison between potential borrowers and the SRLF Board of Directors. The Mayor
may delegate this authority or request assistance as is needed.
         (d)   In addition, three members of the Board will serve as a Loan
Review Committee. This Loan Review Committee will, with the assistance of the
RLF manager, review all loan requests and make recommendations to the full
Board regarding the various requests.
      (2)   Processing fees. A fee of $250 shall be charged to cover the costs
of processing an application. This fee shall be levied only on those applicants
desiring to submit an application for consideration. No charge shall be made

a possible application. No charge to the city for projects.
      (3)   Technical and managerial assistance.
         (a)   Due to their involvement with and knowledge of other sources of
financing, the Lincoln Trail Area Development District shall provide technical
and managerial assistance and secretarial support to the SRLF Board and
potential applicants.
         (b)   Technical assistance shall consist of: working with applicant
and other loan participants to develop a feasible project; seeking additional
loan sources which may be available; reviewing proposals; and advising the SRLF
Board and manager on merits of the loan.
      (4)   Servicing of loans. The city’s Revolving Loan Fund will not
directly engage in the servicing of its portfolio. The Board will negotiate
with outside sources, preferably the first lender, who possess the necessary
skills to service the loans.
      (5)   Monitoring of loan. The RLF manager will conduct a monitoring visit
of each project at least twice a year to determine if there are any problems
that jeopardize the loan. The RLF and servicing agency will keep each other
informed about problems they encounter. If so desired, the Board may request
periodic financial reports from the company as a condition of loan approval.
      (6)   Solicitation of loans. The Revolving Loan Fund will recruit
potential borrowers through several methods. The RLF manager will actively
solicit participation through private lenders, referrals from the State
Development Block Grant Program and other sources as appropriate. These
development agencies will be in the position of making RLF program information
available to various enterprises with which they have contact.
   (C)   (1)   Eligible applicants.
         (a)   The applicant must be registered sole proprietor partnership or

and
         (g)   Any other projects determined not to be in the best interests of
the citizens of the city.

job per every $5,000 of RLF monies. Except under exceptional circumstances, the
SRLF will not consider projects where the ratio exceeds $10,000 per new long-
term job created. Jobs used for purposes of this ratio are those existing at
the end of two years after start-up. Construction jobs in the building of a
facility are not included.
      (2)   No SRLF loans shall be made if funding is otherwise available from
private lenders on terms that would allow for the successful completion of the
project.
      (3)   No SRLF loans can be used to refinance existing debt.
      (4)   The SRLF will not participate in projects outside the geographical

prior to negotiating loan terms.
      (8)   There will be no provision for repayment of money borrowed by the
city.
   (F)   (1)   Initial meeting. The initial meeting that the RLF manager will
conduct with a potential borrower will be to determine eligibility, generally
discuss the project and explain the application process and needed information.
At this point, projects which are ineligible or which do not look strong should
be referred to proper funding sources or discouraged from applying. The loan
manager will indicate that the following items will be required from the
applicant prior to the next meeting:
         (a)   Three-year financial statements, if applicable;
         (b)   A brief description of the request, including total project
cost, amount of loan requested, purpose of loan and terms requested;

Board.
      (2)   Loan application process. Upon determination of applicant
eligibility, the borrower will complete the loan application form. Prior to
this, the borrower will have been issued full information regarding standard
conditions and federally required assurances and conditions. In conjunction
with the above cited standard forms, the SRLF Board of Directors shall request
the following information, much of which will be included as part of the
applicant’s business plan:
         (a)   Financial information, where relevant, which shall include:
            1.   Current audited financial statement, including balance sheets,
income statement with auditor’s footnotes and supporting statements for the
applicants three most recent fiscal years, where applicable, and audited
consolidated financial and income statements, with auditor’s footnotes, of any
parent company for the three most recent fiscal years, also where applicable;
            2.   Most recent interim financial statements of the applicant and,
if applicable, of its parent company, certified by officers of the respective
companies and maintained current during the loan application process; and
            3.   Projected pro forma balance sheets, income statements, cash
flow and supporting statements of the applicant, quarterly, from the date of
the latest interim financial statement to the date of the commencement of
project operation. The statements and balance sheets should reflect the
applicant’s ability to repay debt principal out of earnings within the first
three years of operation.
         (b)   The non-financial information as the RLF Board of Directors
deems is necessary to substantiate the pro forma projections. These may
include, but not be limited to:
            1.   Estimates, firm quotations, receipts, contracts, orders,
invoices, leases or equivalent documentation from architects, engineers,
contractors, sub-contractors, material suppliers, lessors or others involved in
the sale, lease or construction of fixed assets, if any, for applicant’s
project, including schedules of implementation; and
            2.   Any backup information regarding the applicant’s operating
costs, including projected employment by job category and applicable wage rate,
cost and availability of raw materials and energy.
         (c)   General information about company management capabilities,
including resumes of top management and detailed marketing strategies;
         (d)   Such additional information as the SRLF Board of Directors may
require regarding collateral, appraisals, valuations of nonprofit assets and
guarantees;
         (e)   Completed applications; and
         (f)   Signed statement of assurances.
   (G)   (1)   Application review and evaluation.
         (a)   Upon completion of the SRLF full application, the RLF Loan
Review Committee will carry out a loan review and submit its recommendation for
approval or disapproval and the basis for such recommendation to the full
Board. The RLF will then consider the recommendation made by the RLF Loan
Review Committee. The Board may solicit or allow additional comment or
advisement if it so desires. The Board shall then make its recommendations to
the City Council to approve or deny the loan.
         (b)   The SRLF Board of Directors will utilize and fully consider all
loan selection criteria to ascertain whether the proposed project is consistent
with the economic development strategy for the city. The SRLF Board will
determine whether all loan requirements can be met and shall apply their
financial experience and judgment to the project having considered all
available information.
      (2)   Loan Fund Board approval. Upon final approval, the SRL Board
Chairperson will forward the entire package to the RLF’s bank, with a request
to draw down funds to the borrower.
   (H)   The SRLF will closely coordinate all loan closing activity with the
first participation lender to avoid duplication and to hold closing costs to a
minimum. The RLF, working with the participating lender, will make all
necessary preparation for the closing. After scheduling the date of closing,
the RLF will prepare the information and documentation for closing, including:
      (1)   RLF agreement;
      (2)   Participating agreement between RLF and the first position lender;
      (3)   Promissory on mortgage notes;
      (4)   Check from the SRLF; and
      (5)   All closing costs incurred, which will be paid by the borrower at
the time of closing.
   (I)   (1)   The SRLF full loan application form is attached to the ordinance
codified in this section as Appendix 1.
      (2)   (a)   Every six months, the RLF manager will monitor the projects
in the RLF portfolio, evaluate the loans made and determine progress made in
obtaining goals and objectives cited in the SRLF administration plan. Factors
such as jobs created, jobs retained, potential for future job creation, tax
revenues created, types of jobs created, minority and/or women’s business
assisted and the ratio of RLF dollars to jobs retained/created will be
considered in this evaluation process. Results of all project evaluations will
be presented to the SRLF Board and the City Council in an annual report of RLF
activity.
         (b)   All assurances as specified in Community Development Block Grant
regulations shall be agreed to by the borrower in order to receive funds. No
application shall be approved unless the statement of assurances is properly
signed. The loan manager will notify the Department of Local Government of
projects prior to action by the Board. This notification process shall be to
ensure conformance with CDBG regulations.
         (c)   Investment of idle funds shall be in conformance with state
statutes as they relate to investment practices of local governments.
      (3)   Since the monies that help fund this Revolving Loan Fund come from
repayment of loans made from grants received from the Community Development
Block Grant Program, each activity funded under the SRLF program must meet at
least one of the three national objectives identified in Title I of the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended in 1983, hereafter referred
to as the Act, § 104(b)(3). The three objectives are:
         (a)   Benefit to low and moderate income persons;
         (b)   Prevention or elimination of slums or blight; and
         (c)   Meeting community development needs having a particular urgency.
      (4)   In addition to the procedures for loans set out above, the city may
spend funds out of RLF for projects that meet the three national objectives
identified above after review by the RLF Board and approved by the City
Council.
(Prior Code, § 910.0) (Ord. 86-010, passed - -; Ord. 88-012, passed 9-12-1988)
PROCUREMENT STANDARDS
§ 31.15 METHODS OF PROCUREMENT.
   (A)   All procurements made by the city will be made in accordance with the
following procurement standards. Procurement transactions, regardless of method
or dollar value, will maximize open and free competition. The city shall not
engage in procurement practices which may be considered restrictive in trade.
Purchases will be reviewed by the city department heads to prevent duplication
and to ensure that costs are reasonable.
   (B)   Procurements shall be made by one of the following methods: small
purchase procedures; competitive sealed bids; competitive negotiation; and
noncompetitive negotiation.
      (1)   Small purchases. Purchases of supplies, equipment and services
which cost between $15,000 and $40,000 will require written estimates, but no
legal advertisement is required. The city will solicit written responses from
at least three vendors, and if no such responses are available, a statement
explaining the procurement will be prepared and filed. For purchases of less
than $15,000, efforts will be made to get the lowest and best prices, but
written records of such efforts are not necessary.
      (2)   Competitive sealed bids.
         (a)   Bidding will be employed when detailed specifications for the
goods or services to be produced can be prepared and the primary basis for
award is cost. When the cost of a contract, lease or other agreement for
materials, supplies, equipment or contractual services other than those
personal or professional exceeds $40,000, an invitation for bids (IFB) notice
will be prepared. This notice will be published at least once in at least one
official newspaper of general circulation within the city. This newspaper
notice will appear not less than seven days and not more than 21 days before
the due date for bid proposals. The Chief Elected Official may also solicit
sealed bids from responsible prospective suppliers by sending them a copy of
such notice.
         (b)   The IFB will include a general description of the goods or
services to be procured, the bid deposit and bond performance required (if
applicable), the location where bid forms and specifications may be secured,
the time and place for opening bids and whether the bid award will be made on
the basis of the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated price. If the lowest
evaluated price is used, the measurable criteria to be utilized must be stated
in the IFB. The newspaper notice must also contain language which calls to the
attention of bidders all applicable requirements which must be complied with,
such as § 3 of the 1068 Housing Act, § 109 of the 1974 Housing and Community
Development Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 5301 et seq.), the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42
U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq.), Executive Order 11246 and the Davis-Bacon Act (40
U.S.C. §§ 3141 through 3148).
         (c)   Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place
stated in the IFBs. The bids will be tabulated by the City Council at the time
of bid opening. The results of the tabulation and the bid documents will be
examined for accuracy and completeness by the department head which will make
recommendations to the City Council. In addition, the department head
determines whether all firms are responsive and responsible. The City Council
will award the contract to the responsive and responsible bidder with the
lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated bid price. After the bid award is made
by the City Council, a contract will be prepared for execution by the
successful bidder. After the contract is signed, all bid deposits will be
returned to all unsuccessful bidders.
         (d)   The city may cancel an invitation for bid or reject all bids if
it is determined in writing that such is in the best interest of the city. The
city may allow a vendor to withdraw a bid if requested at any time prior to the
bid opening. Bids received after the time set for bid opening shall be returned
to the vendor unopened.
      (3)   Competitive negotiation.
         (a)   The city will utilize competitive negotiations, regardless of
contract amount, upon a written determination that:
            1.   Specifications cannot be made specific enough to permit the
award of a bid on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest
evaluated bid price (in other words, bidding is not feasible); and
            2.   The services to be procured are professional or personal in
nature.
         (b)   With the exception of procurement of certain professional
services (principally engineering services), competitive negotiations will
proceed as follows.
            1.   Proposals will be solicited through newspaper advertisement;
additionally, a request for proposal (RFP) may be prepared and mailed to
qualified vendors. The newspaper advertisement must be published at least seven
days and not more than 21 days before the date for receipt of the proposals.
The RFP will describe services needed and identify the factors to be considered
in the evaluation of proposals and the relative weights assigned to each
selection factor. The RFP will also state where further details regarding the
RFP may be obtained. The RFP will call attention to the same regulations
discussed in the bidding process. Requests for proposals will always include
cost as a selection factor.
            2.   Award must be made to the offerer whose proposal is determined
in writing by a review committee to be the top rated proposal according to the
systematic evaluation. Evaluations must be based on the factors set forth in
the request for proposal and a written evaluation of each response prepared.
The review committee may contact the firms regarding their proposals for the
purpose of clarification and record in writing the nature of the clarification.
If it is determined that no acceptable proposal has been submitted, all
proposals may be rejected. New proposals may be solicited on the same or
revised terms or the procurement may be abandoned.
      (4)   Noncompetitive negotiations.
         (a)   Noncompetitive negotiations may be used for procurements in
excess of $40,000 when bidding or competitive negotiations are not feasible.
The city may purchase goods and services through noncompetitive negotiations
when it is determined in writing by the Mayor that competitive negotiation or
bidding is not feasible and that:
            1.   An emergency exists which will cause public harm as a result
of the delay caused by following competitive purchasing procedures;
            2.   The product or service can be obtained only from one source;
            3.   The contract is for the purchase of perishable items purchased
on a weekly or more frequent basis;
            4.   Only one satisfactory proposal is received through RFP or RFQ;
or
            5.   The state has authorized the particular type of non-
competitive negotiation (example: the procurement of services by an Area
Development District).
         (b)   Procurement by non-competitive negotiation requires the
strictest attention to the observation of impartiality toward all suppliers.
(Ord. 2004-001, passed 3-9-2004; Ord. 2023-010, passed 7-11-2023)
§ 31.16 CONTRACTS.
   Generally, all procurement in excess of $15,000 will be memorialized and
supported by a written contract. Where it is infeasible or impractical to
prepare a contract, a written finding to this effect will be prepared and some
form of documentation regarding the transaction will also be prepared. The
contractual provisions required by the “Common Rule,” 24 C.F.R. part 85 will be
included in all contracts.
(Ord. 2004-001, passed 3-9-2004)
§ 31.17 DOCUMENTATION.
   All source documents supporting any given transaction (receipts, purchase
orders, invoices, RFP/RFQ data and bid materials) will be retained and filed in
an appropriate manner. Where feasible, source documents pertinent to each
individual procurement shall be separately filed and maintained. Where it is
infeasible to maintain individual procurement files, source documents will be
filed and maintained in a reasonable manner (examples include chronologically,
by vendor, by type of procurement and so forth). Whatever form of documentation
and filing is employed, the purpose of this section is to ensure that a clear
and consistent audit trail is established. At a minimum, source document data
must be sufficient to establish the basis for selection basis for cost
(including the issue of reasonableness of cost) and basis for payment.
(Ord. 2004-001, passed 3-9-2004)
§ 31.18 LOCALLY OWNED, MINORITY OWNED, FEMALE OWNED AND SMALL BUSINESS.
   Efforts will be made and documented to solicit participation of locally
owned, minority owned, female owned and small businesses. Where feasible,
evaluation criteria will include a factor with an appropriate weight for these
firms. A list of locally owned, minority owned, female owned and small
businesses and also minority businesses located within the trade region shall
be maintained and utilized when issuing IFBs, RFPs and RFQs. This list shall
also be consulted when making small purchases.
(Ord. 2004-001, passed 3-9-2004)
§ 31.19 CODE OF CONDUCT.
   (A)   Conflict of interest. No elected official, employee or designated
agent of the city will take part or have an interest in the award of any
procurement transaction if a conflict of interest, clear or apparent, exists.
   (B)   Acceptance of gratuities. No elected official, employee or designated
agent of the city shall solicit or accept gratuities, favors or anything of
monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, subcontractors or
potential subcontractors.
(Ord. 2004-001, passed 3-9-2004) Penalty, see §
31.99
§ 31.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99.
   (B)   Any elected official, employee or designated agency of the city who
knowingly and deliberately violates the provisions of §§
31.15 through
31.19 will be open to civil suit by the citizens of the city without the legal
protection of the city. Furthermore, such a violation of the procurement
standards is grounds for dismissal by the city.

obligations shall be specifically provided for in the political subdivision’s
budget for each and every year this agreement shall be and remain in force. In
determining the rate of taxation for the annual levies, the political
subdivision shall anticipate the collection of taxes in an amount not to exceed
90% of the levy. All collections pursuant to the levy shall be covered into a
revolving fund, to be created by the political subdivision, which shall be
devoted exclusively to the payment of the obligations imposed under this
contract, as when the same shall become due and payable, until all of the
obligations shall have been satisfied in full.
      (2)   Provided, however, for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1951, and
ending June 30, 1952, or for any subsequent fiscal year hereunder, the
foregoing requirements of this section may be dispensed with by the political
subdivision paying in advance into its revolving fund an amount of money
sufficient to meet the combined employer-employee contributions for the fiscal
year.
   (C)   (1)   The political subdivision agrees to and shall advance to the
contribution fund, provided for in KRS 61.470, an amount equal to the average
quarterly contributions provided for in division (A) above plus 10% thereof,
which shall be credited to the political subdivision in the contribution fund
account.
      (2)   The average quarterly contribution shall be arrived at in the first
instance by a fair estimate based on the payroll for the previous calendar
year; provided, however, that, the advancement may be adjusted from time to
time as the state agency may require, and, when adjusted, the estimate shall be
based on the payroll for the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date of
the adjustment. The advancement provided for herein may be used by the state
agency to offset any unpaid financial obligation incurred by the political
subdivision hereunder, and for no other purpose, and may be applied thereto
summarily, but the use shall not relieve the political subdivision of the
obligation to the state agency; provided, however, that no advancement by the
political subdivision shall be applied to the default of any other political
subdivision.
   (D)   The political subdivision will pay to the State Treasury, at such time
or times that the state agency may by regulation prescribe, an amount equal to
the political subdivision’s share of the cost of administration of the state
agency, such amount to be not greater than 5% of the contributions made by the
political subdivision under division (A) above.
   (E)   (1)   The political subdivision agrees that it shall impose upon each
of its employees, as to services which are covered by this plan and agreement,
a contribution with respect to his or her wages, not exceeding the amount of
the tax which would be imposed by § 1400 of the Federal Insurance Contribution
Act, 26 U.S.C. § 3101 if the services constituted employment within the meaning
of that Act, and to deduct the amount of the contribution from his or her wages
as and when paid.
      (2)   It is further understood that the contributions so collected shall
be paid into the contribution fund in partial discharge of the liability of the
political subdivision, but that failure to make the deduction shall not relieve
the employee or the political subdivision from liability therefor.
(Prior Code, § 240.1)
§ 32.24 ADJUSTMENTS, REFUNDS AND INTEREST ON DELINQUENT PAYMENTS.
   (A)   If more than the correct amount due under §
32.23 is paid with respect to any remuneration, proper adjustment (or refund,
if adjustment is impracticable) shall be made without interest in such manner
and at such times as the state agency shall prescribe.
   (B)   If the political subdivision does not make at the time or times due,
the payments required under this plan and agreement, there shall be added, or
part of the amount due, interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or fraction
thereof.
   (C)   Without prejudice to other available methods of collection, the state
agency in its discretion may deduct such delinquent amounts plus interest from
any other money payable to the political subdivision by any department, agency
or fund of the state.
(Prior Code, § 240.1)
§ 32.25 TERMINATION.
   (A)   (1)   The political subdivision may request the state agency to take
all necessary steps with the Federal Security Administrator, pursuant to § 218
(g) of the Social Security Act, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 301 through 1307, to
terminate this plan and agreement either in its entire application to the
political subdivision or with respect to any coverage group.
      (2)   Upon good cause shown at a time in a manner to be specified by the
state agency, the state agency shall give notice to the Federal Security
Administrator required by § 218(g) of the Social Security Act, being 42 U.S.C.
§§ 301 through 1307 for the purpose of granting the requested termination to
the political subdivision.
   (B)   If the state agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the
political subdivision, finds that there has been a failure to comply
substantially with any provision contained in this plan and agreement or KRS
Chapter 61, it may terminate this plan in its entirety, the termination to take
effect at the time prescribed in the notice and on such conditions as may be
provided by regulations of the state agency, and as may be consistent with the
provisions of the Social Security Act, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 301 through 1307.
(Prior Code, § 240.1)
§ 32.26 MODIFICATION.
   (A)   This plan and agreement may be modified, at the request of the
political subdivision, to include coverage groups or services in addition to
those now included by this plan.
   (B)   The modification must be consistent with KRS Chapter 61 and the
provisions of § 218 of the Social Security Act, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 301 through
1307.
(Prior Code, § 240.1)

participation, vote, decision or action, no monetary or material gain accrues
to the officer or employee, family member or a business associate, as a member

directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the

§ 52.045 PERMITS.
   (A)   There shall be two classes of building sewer permits required for
residential and for service to commercial and industrial establishments. In
either case, the owner(s) or his, her or their agent shall make application on
a special form furnished by the City Water and Sewer Commission. Applicants for
service to commercial and industrial establishments shall be required to
furnish information about all waste-producing activities, wastewater
characteristics and constituents. The permit application shall be supplemented
by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the
judgment of the Pretreatment Coordinator. Details regarding commercial and
industrial permits include, but are not limited to, those required by this
chapter. Permit and inspection fees shall be paid to the Commission at the time
the application is filed.
   (B)   Users shall promptly notify the Pretreatment Coordinator in advance of
any introduction of wastewater constituents, a slug and/or accidental discharge
or any substantial change in the volume or character of the wastewater
constituents being introduced into the POTW. The Pretreatment Coordinator may
deny or place conditions on the new introduction, change in discharge or slug/
accidental discharge based on the information submitted in the notification or

   (A)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement wall
seepage or floor seepage, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains or other
surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in
turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public, sanitary sewer. Any such
connections which already exist on the effective date of this chapter shall be
completely and permanently disconnected within 60 days of the effective date of
this chapter. The owner(s) of any building sewers having the connections, leaks
or defects shall bear all costs incidental to removal of the sources. Pipes,
sumps and pumps for the sources of groundwater and surface water shall be
separate from wastewater facilities. Removal of the sources of water without
presence of separate facilities shall be evidence of drainage to public
sanitary sewer. Connections shall be subject to inspection by the Pretreatment
Coordinator to verify compliance. Inspections may be performed periodically at
the discretion of the Pretreatment Coordinator or at the time of connection/
reconnection.
   (B)   Floor, basement or crawl space drains which are lower than ground
surfaces surrounding the building shall not be connected to the building
sanitary sewer. No sanitary inlet which is lower than six inches above the top
of the lowest of the two adjacent public sanitary sewer manholes shall be
connected by direct drainage to the building sanitary sewer.
   (C)   Building sanitary sewer connections in structures not meeting the
criteria of this section win be permitted only if the property owner has:
      (1)   Installed an individual pumping facility at the structure to
receive the building sewage (the pumping facility shall include a discharge
pipe with a high point which meets the criteria above); or
      (2)   Installed a minimum of two sewer backflow stops or flaps at least
12 inches apart of such nature and design to provide gravity flow to the
sanitary sewer system and to prevent sewage backflow into the property
improvement.
(Ord. 2022-011, passed 12-19-2022) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.047 DESIGN AND INSTALLATION.
   (A)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway. The sewer from
the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any
obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such
single connection aforementioned.
   (B)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent, to meet all
requirements of this chapter. Permit and inspection fees for new buildings
using existing building sewers shall be the same as for new building sewers. If
additional sewer customers are added to the old building sewers, additional
sewer tap fees shall be charged accordingly even though no new sewer tap is
actually made into the city system.
   (C)   Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customer’s
side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than that of the
customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be permitted.
   (D)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM A-74, latest
revision, PVC (polyvinylchloride) sewer pipe, ASTM C-700, latest revision, or
ductile iron pipe, AWWA specification C-151 cement lined, and shall meet all
requirements of the State Plumbing Code. Joints shall be as set out
hereinafter. Any part of the building sewer that is located within five feet of
a water service pipe shall be constructed with cast iron soil pipe or ductile
iron pipe, unless the building sewer is at least one foot deeper in the ground
than the water service line. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe may be
required by the city where the building sewer is exposed to damage or stoppage
by tree roots. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe shall be used in filled
or unstable ground, in areas where the cover over the building sewer is less
than three feet, or, in areas where the sewer is subject to vehicular or other
external loads.
   (E)   The size, slope, alignment materials of construction of a building
sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the requirements of the
local and State Building and Plumbing Codes and other applicable rules and
regulations of the city. Manholes may be required at all commercial and
industrial connections to the city’s municipal sewer system. The owner of the
facility shall be responsible for all costs associated with installation of the
manhole(s). Specifications for manholes may be obtained by contacting the
Pretreatment Coordinator.
   (F)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall
indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. Fees for connection shall
be as established by the Commission.
   (G)   The owner shall ensure that all excavations for building sewer
installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the Commission.
   (H)   In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by the drain
shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the same building sewer.
Drain pipe and sump for collection of the sanitary drainage shall be above
basement floor or in separately watertight or drained sump or channel and must
be inspected and approved by the Pretreatment Coordinator prior to connection
to the system.
   (I)   The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the
easement or property line, and the owner must install at a point prior to the
tap a six-inch clean-out tee with a cleanout at ground level and an approved
backwater valve in order to prevent a sewer backup into property owner’s
dwelling. Where no property located service branch is available, an authorized
agent of the city shall cut a neat hole into the main line of the public sewer
and a suitable wye or tee saddle installed to receive the building sewer. The
invert of the building sewer at the point of connection with a saddle shall be
in the upper quadrant of the main line of the public sewer. A neat workmanlike
connection, not extending past the inner surface of the public sewer, shall be
made and the saddle made secure and watertight by encasement in epoxy cement
specially prepared for this purpose. A wye and H bend fitting shall be
installed at the property line between the public sewer and the building sewer.
This fitting shall serve the purpose of a cleanout and for applying the smoke
test during inspection of the line. After testing, a cast iron or ductile iron
riser will be inserted in this fitting and brought flush with the ground
surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type joint applicable to the pipe
used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion of groundwater or surface
water.
   (J)   All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet or
exceed the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code.
   (K)   All persons working on city sewers with a cleaning rod must use an
approved type rod in cleaning sewer connections to city sewers.
   (L)   All sewer main extensions must conform to the following manhole lid
and ring specifications.
      (1)   Heavy traffic weight rings and lids shall be used at all manholes
installed.
      (2)   Manhole lids shall have a maximum of two pickholes, preferably one,
and no other holes in the lid.
      (3)   The maximum size of the pickhole is one inch by one-half inch.
      (4)   Pickholes shall not extend all the way through the lid.
      (5)   Total clearance between the lid and manhole ring shall be one-
quarter inch, i.e., if the inside diameter of the ring is 23 inches, the
outside diameter of the lid should be 22 and three-quarters inches.
      (6)   The bottom of the lid must not extend below the ring lip; that is,
the lid must be of uniform thickness throughout. Otherwise, there must be a
one-inch clearance between the extension and ring; extension depth shall not
exceed two inches.
      (7)   Compatible riser rings must be available to bring manhole to final
grade required.
      (8)   Each manhole ring and lid must be installed complete with a “dish”
type seal to prevent inflow of surface water.
   (M)   This section shall not affect sewers installed or approved in
accordance with the provisions of the prior version of the city’s sewer use
ordinance, which was originally adopted on January 1, 1993.

§ 52.048 INSPECTION.
   (A)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
Pretreatment Coordinator when the building sewer is ready for connection to the
public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her representative. The connections shall be
made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing.
   (B)   All building sewers shall be smoke-tested through the wye branch at
the public sewer connection, with public sewer tightly plugged off, after
connections at both ends are made and after all pipe is properly bedded and
backfilled at least to top of pipe and if backfill is completed, within two
weeks after completion of backfill. At time of test, any openings into the
building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any
leakage of smoke from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be
located at test and repaired to stand repetition of smoke test without leakage.
Tests shall be performed at the expense of the property owner in the presence
of the Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her designee. When smoke testing is
completed, the temporary flow line plug shall be removed and a permanent water
tight plug shall be placed in branch of test wye-branch and carefully
backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six inches above the top of the
branch.
   (C)   All new sewer line extensions shall be air tested and all manholes
vacuum tested. The entire system will be flooded and video inspected. Any lines
found holding water will have to be removed and re-installed. All tests will be
at the expense of the developer and must be done under the supervision of the
Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her representative. In addition to these
tests, the developer will, upon completion of the extension, submit a copy of
the as-built plans signed by the engineer. The developer will provide a one-
year warranty on the extension effective from the date of acceptance of the
extension into the City Water and Sewer Commission’s system. Extensions will
not be accepted into the SWSC system until 80% of the development has been put
into service and the extension has passed an inspection conducted by the
Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her representative.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.140 GENERAL.
   (A)   The Commission, through the Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her
designee, to ensure compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40
C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N, and 401 KAR 5:055, may take the following
enforcement steps against users in noncompliance with this chapter. The
remedies available to the POTW include injunctive relief, civil and criminal
penalties, immediate discontinuance of discharges and/or water service and the
publishing of the list of significant violators annually. The enforcement
authority shall be vested in the Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her
designee.
   (B)   (1)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may suspend the wastewater
treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution permit when such suspension
is necessary, in the opinion of the Pretreatment Coordinator, in order to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent. or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the
environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES/KPDES permit. Any user notified of a suspension of the
wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the contribution.
      (2)   In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with
the suspension order, the Commission shall take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection and/or water service to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The Commission shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit
and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Commission within 15
days of the date of occurrence.

Commission with written notice stating the nature of the violation(s). Within
ten days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted to the Pretreatment Coordinator.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of potential liability for
any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   If the violations persist or the explanations and/or plans are not
adequate, the Commission’s response shall be more formal and commitments (or
schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in an enforceable
document. The enforcement response selected will be related to the seriousness

continue to discharge in violation of this chapter or other pretreatment
standards or requirements or is determined to be a chronic or persistent
violator or who is determined to be a significant violator, shall be ordered to
appear before the Commission.
      (2)   At the appearance, a compliance schedule will be given to the
nonconforming user and an administrative fine assessed. The fine shall be
determined on a case-by-case basis which shall consider the type and severity

treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been
installed and are properly operated.
         (b)   Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be
reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including
the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and
best management practices.

         (a)   Comply forthwith; or
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
   (C)   (1)   The Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her designee may issue to
any user who causes or contributes to violations of this chapter, a wastewater
permit or an order issued hereunder, an order to appear and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the
Pretreatment Coordinator regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is
to be taken, the proposed enforcement action and directing the user to show
cause, before the Pretreatment Coordinator, why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days
before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of the
industrial user. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user or its
representative appears, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.

treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly
operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be
issued.
   (C)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may decline to reissue a permit to any
industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter
or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless the industrial user
first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to
restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge.
(Ord. 2022-011, passed 12-19-2022)
§ 52.999 PENALTY.

found to have violated any provision of this chapter or permits or orders
issued hereunder shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per

deemed a separate and distinct violation. The assessments may be added to the
user’s next scheduled sewer service charge, and the Pretreatment Coordinator
shall have such other collection remedies as needed to collect other service
charges. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall constitute a lien against
the user’s property. Users desiring to dispute such penalties must file a
written request for the Chairperson of the Commission to reconsider the penalty
within ten business days of being notified of the penalty. Where the
Chairperson believes an appeal has merit, he or she shall convene a hearing on
the matter within 15 days of receiving the appeal from the user. The
Chairperson’s final decision shall be binding.
   (B)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may decline to reissue a permit to any
industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter
or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless the user first files

value determined by the Pretreatment Coordinator to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
   (C)   (1)   Written notice.
         (a)   Any user found to be violating any provision of this chapter or

publication of violators in the local newspaper to administrative penalties of
up to $1,000 per day per violation or criminal prosecution as outlined herein.
      (2)   Revocation of permit.
         (a)   Any user violating any of the provisions of this chapter or a

damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is part of the POTW. Any person(s) violating this provision
shall be subject to criminal prosecution for “disorderly conduct.” It shall be
noted that the Clean Water Act, being 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq. does not
require proof of specific intent to obtain conviction.
      (3)   Legal action. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or
other wastes into the Commission’s wastewater disposal system contrary to the
provisions of this chapter, federal or state pretreatment requirements or any
order of the Commission, the Commission may commence an action for appropriate
legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate court of this jurisdiction in
addition to pursuing any criminal remedies that may be available.
      (4)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or order issued hereunder the
Pretreatment Coordinator, through counsel may petition the court for the
issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be
appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user.
      (5)   Liability. Any user violating any of the provisions of this
chapter, discharge permit or other order issued hereunder shall become liable

court reporter fees and other expenses associated with the enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses.

assess and recover the sums. In determining amount of liability, the court
shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited
to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice
requires.
      (7)   Criminal prosecution.

§ 91.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Violations. A violation of this chapter occurs whenever anybody, by
either act or omission, conspires, causes, permits, encourages, aids, assists,
allows or engages in any of the acts, actions, behaviors, conditions and
occurrences prohibited by this chapter, and each and every separate non-
continuing occurrence thereof, and each and every day of each continuing
occurrence thereof is a separate violation of this chapter. A violation of this
chapter may be a criminal offense and/or a civil violation.
   (B)   Criminal offense. Each violation of this chapter shall be a
misdemeanor for which everybody convicted thereof in a court of competent
jurisdiction shall be sentenced to pay a criminal fine not to exceed the
maximum amount of $250 as set forth in KRS 534.040(2)(b) or a term of
imprisonment not to exceed the maximum period of 90 days as set forth in KRS
532.090(2), or both. For a corporation, the fine shall be fixed by KRS 534.050
(c) and not exceed $5,000 per offense.
   (C)   Civil violation.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of the Housing Inspector of the city or other
officer designated by the Mayor to serve or cause to be served a notice upon
the owner or occupant of any premises on which there is kept or maintained any
nuisance in violation of the provision of this chapter and to demand the
abatement of the nuisance within five days, or a reasonable time period as
determined by the Mayor, unless the nuisance constitutes an immediate danger to
the health and well-being of the community. If such danger is present, the
nuisance shall be abated within 24 hours of notice. Notice shall be served upon
persons by certified mail, or hand delivered by an officer designated by the
Mayor, but if the whereabouts of the person is unknown and cannot be
ascertained by the Housing Inspector, or officer designated by the Mayor, in
the exercise of reasonable diligence, an affidavit to that effect and the
serving of notice may be made by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation for two consecutive issue days. A copy of the notice shall be
posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected by the notice, and it
shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk.
      (2)   If the person so served does not abate the nuisance within
prescribed amount of time, the city may proceed to abate the nuisance keeping
an account of the expense of the abatement, and the expense shall be charged
and paid by the owner occupant.
      (3)   Charges for nuisance abatement shall be a lien upon the premises.
Whenever a bill for charges remains unpaid for 60 days after it has been
rendered, the City Clerk may file with the County Clerk a statement of lien
claims. This statement shall contain a legal description of the premises, the
expenses and costs incurred, the date the nuisance was abated and a notice that
the city claims a lien for this amount. Notice of the lien claim shall be
mailed to the owner of the premises if his or her address is known. However,
failure to record the lien claim or to mail the notice, or the failure of the
owner to receive the notice, shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien
for charges as provided in division (C)(4) below.
      (4)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid nuisance abatement charges
may be sold for nonpayment, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to
pay the charges after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of
statutory liens. This foreclosure shall be in equity in the name of the city.
This remedy is in addition to any other remedies available in law or equity to
the city.
      (5)   The City Attorney is authorized and may institute such proceedings,
in the name of the city, in any court having jurisdiction over the matter
against any property for which the bill has remained unpaid for 60 days after
the abatement has been completed and a bill for the abatement cost has been
presented to the property owner for payment.

the same cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the
Housing Authority shall make an affidavit to that effect, then the serving of
such complaint or order upon such persons may be made by publication pursuant

shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order requiring
the owner:
      (1)   To repair, alter or improve the dwelling, to the intent and within
the time specified in the order, to render it fit for human habitation or, at
the option of the owner, to vacate and close the dwelling as a human habitation
if the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling can be made at a cost
that is not more than 50% of the value of the dwelling; and
      (2)   Within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish the
dwelling if the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling cannot be

the dwelling, the Authority may cause such dwelling to be removed or
demolished.
      (3)   The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or improvements or
vacating and closing, or removal or demolition, shall be a lien upon the real
property upon which such cost was incurred. If the dwelling is removed or
demolished by the Housing Authority, it shall sell the materials of the
dwelling and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the
removal or demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the
circuit court by the Housing Authority, and shall be secured in such manner as
may be directed by such court, and shall be disbursed by such court to the
persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of such court.

provisions of the order, and the court may issue a temporary injunction

§ 93.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he or she will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter “person
aggrieved”) may file a complaint with the Chief Executive Officer. Complaints
shall be in writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as
the Chief Executive Officer requires. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the
Chief Executive Officer shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or
persons who allegedly committed or about to commit the alleged discriminatory
housing practice. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or within 30 days
after the expiration of any period of reference under division (C) below, the
Chief Executive Officer shall investigate the complaint and give notice in
writing to the person aggrieved whether he or she intends to resolve it. If the
Chief Executive Officer decides to resolve the complaints, he or she shall
proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing
practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion.
Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made
public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter
without the written consent of the persons concerned.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) above shall be filed within 180 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be
in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file answer to the complaint
against him or her and may. with the leave of the Chief Executive Officer,
which shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, amend
his or her answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If, within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chief Executive Officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance with this chapter, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days
thereafter, file a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The Chief Executive Officer will assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the Chief Executive Officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance within 30 days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30
days hereafter, commence a civil action in any appropriate court against the
respondent named in the complaint to enforce the rights granted or protected by
this chapter. Insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint. If
the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about
to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice or
order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
Chief Executive Officer shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain
voluntary compliance.
(Ord. 92-002, passed 5-11-1992)
§ 93.11 INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENAS; EVIDENCE.
   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the Chief Executive Officer shall have
access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and
other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy
such materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons
as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation; provided,
however, that the Chief Executive Officer first complies with the provisions of
the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The Chief
Executive Officer may issue subpoenas to compel his or her access to or the
production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue
interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same
limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or
served in aid of a civil action in the United States district court for the
district in which the investigation is taking place. The Chief Executive
Officer may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the Chief Executive Officer, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the name of the Chief Executive Officer to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued by the Chief Executive Officer. Subpoenas
issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their face the name and
address of such respondent and shall state that they were issued at his or her
request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Chief Executive Officer shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in United States district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the Chief Executive Officer to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The Chief Executive Officer shall grant the petition if he or she
finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable
time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to
any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced and that compliance would be unduly
onerous or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Chief
Executive Officer or other person at whose request it was issued may petition
for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which
the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides was served or transacts
business.
   (F)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the Chief
Executive Officer participates as a part or as amicus pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 92-002, passed 5-11-1992)
§ 93.12 ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS.
   (A)   The rights granted by §§
93.03 through
93.06 may be enforced by civil actions in state or local courts of general
jurisdiction. A civil action shall be commenced within 108 days after the
alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that the
court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or §
93.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the Chief Executive Officer are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice
complained or in the complaint made to the Chief Executive Officer and which
practice forms the basis for the action in court; provided, however, that any
sale, encumbrance or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court
order issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fide
purchaser, encumbrancer or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the
filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter,
shall not be affected.
   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees in the case
of a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that said plaintiff in the opinion of the
court is not financially able to assume said attorneys’ fees.

§ 110.04 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) below, net profits shall be
apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the net profits by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) below, plus
the sales factor, described in division (C) below, and the denominator of which
is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profits by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) below.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid in the city during the tax period by the business entity for
compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid by
the business entity everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in
the city based on the time the individual’s service is performed within the
city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period:
      (1)   The sales, lease or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity; and
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of gross receipts.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid as a result
of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The license tax
shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the compensation for work
performed or services rendered within the city bears to the total wages and
compensation paid. In order for the city to verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s
reported percentages under this division (E), the taxpayer shall maintain
adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations and all other entities where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
“passed through” these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government and shall employ the same methods of accounting required for
federal income tax purposes.
(Ord. 2007-010, passed 11-13-2007)
§ 110.05 EMPLOYERS TO WITHHOLD.
   (A)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee shall

section.
   (B)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section

required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the city.

required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and

withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
    (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a

corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city; nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided, that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
division (H) unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account
for or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes

   (B)   When deemed necessary, the city may request a business or individual
federal income tax return and all supporting statements and schedules at the

adjustments made by the federal government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns and comply with rules as the city from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath or keep records, as the city deems sufficient to
determine the tax liability the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the taxable income
of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business
entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.

returns or reports required to be filed with the tax district or other proper

character of the information so furnished. Provided, further, that the city may
publish statistics based on such information in such a manner as not to reveal
data respecting net profits or compensation of any person.
   (C)   In addition, the city is empowered to execute similar reciprocity

(Ord. 2024-019, passed 11-12-2024) Penalty, see §
116.999
§ 116.023 REFUND OF FEES.
   (A)   Should any licensee under this chapter be prohibited from conducting
the licensed business for the full period covered by the license because of any
changes that may hereafter be made in the laws of the state with reference to
alcoholic beverages or other cause outside licensee’s control, then the city
shall refund to licensee the proportionate part of the license fee for the
period during which licensee is prevented from carrying on said business if the
licensee provides sufficient proof to the City ABC Administrator that such
period of inactivity was not the fault of the licensee or the result of a
revocation, suspension or other wrongdoing by licensee, or an agent or employee
of the licensee.
   (B)   In the event a violation of this chapter occurs that results in the
suspension or revocation of the license, the city shall not be required to
refund any portion of the license fee.
   (C)   Payment of said regulatory fee shall be remitted to the City ABC
Administrator, who shall transmit all fees to the City Clerk, or his or her
designee, for deposit into the appropriate designated account. The city may use
said fees as permitted by law, including, but not limited to, any cost of
additional policing, regulatory or administrative expenses related to the sale
of alcoholic beverages in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in
addition to any other fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit
against a regulatory license fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount
equal to any license fee shall be based on paperwork required by the local and/
or State ABC Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, tax
returns and financial statements. Said paperwork and payment will be due
according to the schedule set forth by the Mayor, or his or her designee, which
may be set at, but is not limited to, time periods consisting of a monthly or
quarterly billing by the local ABC office and/or the city.
   (D)   Failure to pay such remittance within ten days of the due date
constitutes a violation and shall subject a licensee to suspension or
revocation.
   (E)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay remittance by the due
date is 5% of the regulatory fee for each 90 days or fraction thereof. The
total late filing penalty shall not exceed 25% of the regulatory fee; provided,
however, that in no case shall the penalty be less than $10.
   (F)   Interest at the rate of 8% per annum will apply to any late payments.
   (G)   The City ABC Administrator shall transmit all fees and any other types
of payment made to the city, upon collection, to the City Clerk or his or her
designee, for deposit into the appropriate designated account.

alcoholic beverage license in the newspaper used by the city for legal notices
under KRS 424.120. The notice shall include the following.
      (1)   The advertisement shall state the name and address of the applicant

renewals of existing licenses shall be in writing and upon the forms provided
by the State ABC Board and/or the city, both of which may be amended and
supplemented from time to time by each respective agency.
      (2)   The application shall be verified and shall set forth in detail
such information concerning the applicant and the premises for which the

check or money order for the amount of the license fee.
      (4)   In addition to the above specified information, the applicant shall
file, with the application, responses to any additional questions as may be
posed or prescribed by the City ABC Administrator. The City Council has adopted
a statement of guidelines and priorities for the issuance of licenses within
this chapter to determine the extent to which applications may further, or
impede, the objectives of those guidelines. Therefore, in addition to the
information contained in the application, the City ABC Administrator may
require such other information as the Administrator may, in his or her
discretion, deem desirable, reasonable or appropriate to the consideration of
the application.
(Ord. 2024-019, passed 11-12-2024)
§ 116.025 GENERAL LICENSE CONDITIONS.
   In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations required or
permitted by law:
   (A)   The City ABC Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage
license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his or her
place of business shall have been approved by a licensed building inspector and
any and all other inspections required by the State Building Code or other
applicable law;
   (B)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be granted or
renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any property taxes,
both real and personal, any other taxes due to the city, fees of any type, or
charges due to any department of the city at the time of issuing the license,
nor may any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or
property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any of the
above delinquent payments due and owing to the city. Further, if a licensee
becomes delinquent in the payment of any of the above at any time during the
license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be subject
to revocation or suspension; and
   (C)   No person, whether an applicant for license or a licensee, shall in
any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the City
ABC Administrator, or any member of the city’s staff, or any State ABC
Administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This division (C) is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion, however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license who engages in attempted bribes, threats,
attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or State ABC Administrator
or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a license in
addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for appeals
shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this
chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit monetary
settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order
or revocation or suspension, where this chapter and applicable statutes allow
for such payments in settlement.
(Ord. 2024-019, passed 11-12-2024) Penalty, see §
116.999
§ 116.026 DENIAL OF LICENSE.
   (A)   The City ABC Administrator may deny a city license for any of the
following reasons:
      (1)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for suspension
or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for state
licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as violation of
any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or the
administration thereof;
      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of license
would be authorized under local, state or federal law; or
      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
   (B)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the City ABC
Administrator may appeal the refusal to the State Board pursuant to §
116.047.
(Ord. 2024-019, passed 11-12-2024)
§ 116.027 FORM OF LICENSE.
   All city licenses shall be in such form as may be provided by the ABC
Administrator but at the least shall contain:
   (A)   The name and address of the licensee;
   (B)   The number of the license;
   (C)   The type of license;
   (D)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the licensed
premises;
   (E)   The expiration date of the license; and
   (F)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a property or
vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to law.
(Ord. 2024-019, passed 11-12-2024)
§ 116.028 CHANGE OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the City ABC Administrator with ten days of the change.
    (B)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The
City ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, and as used with regard to a
partnership, corporation, LLC or other business organization herein, the word
CHANGE is construed to include any change in managers, partners or LLC members,
directors or officers of the corporation, or change in ownership or stock
whereby any person secures 10% of the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer
of more than 10% of the total ownership or stock shall require a new license.
   (D)   The following information shall be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
      (1)   Name and address;
      (2)   Nature of interest;
      (3)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
      (4)   Date of birth;
      (5)   Date residence was established in the state, if a resident of the
state. If a resident, indicate when residence was established;
      (6)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license or
in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license under this act;
      (7)   Extent of stock or company ownership; and

provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of
any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant’s business income is earned from the sale

with the applicant’s quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide
the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee’s acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identity each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of

filing of reports notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the

the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this chapter. In the event the
conditions of any license requirement are not met during any particular
quarter, the City ABC Administrator shall have discretion in determining
whether revocation is appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a
reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is
demonstrated by the licensee, the City ABC Administrator may apply an
accounting period of at least one year in determining whether or not the food
sale percentage requirement has been met.
   (B)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain, upon the
licensed premises, adequate books and records of all transactions involved in

regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all

the dormancy rule have been included in this section.

90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in

If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the City
ABC Administrator.
   (C)   The provisions of division (B) above shall not apply to any licensee
who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a license is
issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of
the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency under
power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or
loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the
expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to the City
ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the fact that the licensee
is unable to continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set forth
herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an extension of the dormancy
with the license continuing to remain in effect during the license period or
until same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no
business is transacted during said period; provided, however, that no such
license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted thereunder
within 12 months from the date of notice to the City ABC Administrator. Such
extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be for such times as
the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of his or her sound
discretion.

   (A)   (1)   Licensees in the downtown business district/area may request a
permit to use sidewalk as an adjunct to the primary and adjacent licensed
premises to serve food and alcoholic beverages there. In the case of permitted
sidewalk cafés, they shall be deemed part of the licensed premises.
      (2)   Any licensee/restaurant that is licensed under this chapter and the
provisions of the state ABC laws, may, upon application to the local ABC
Administrator, ask permission to expand the operation of the business/
restaurant onto a part, and only that part, of the public sidewalk which
immediately adjoins the licensed premises (hereinafter referred to as “sidewalk
café”). Licensees who do not serve food shall not be eligible to apply for a
sidewalk café permit.
    (B)   The issuance of a permit shall be subject to the following conditions
and restrictions; provided, however, that the ABC Administrator may without
adverse hearing procedures impose additional reasonable restrictions or
withdraw approval upon the operation of any sidewalk café where necessary in
the judgment of said Administrator to protect the public health, safety or
welfare or to prevent a nuisance from developing or continuing.
      (1)   No sidewalk café shall be permitted in any portion of the public
sidewalk where normal pedestrian traffic flow is obstructed. A minimum
clearance width of 36 inches must be maintained on the public sidewalk at all
times. The sidewalk café shall not be permitted in any manner to obstruct the

tables, chairs and other portable appurtenances shall be confined to the area
shown on the approved permit. While such café is in operation, all tables and
chairs shall be kept in a clean, sanitary condition.
      (3)   The use of a portion of the public sidewalk as a sidewalk café
shall not be an exclusive use. All public improvements, including, but not
limited to, trees, light poles, traffic signals, pull boxes or manholes, or any
public-initiated maintenance procedures, shall take precedence over said use of
the public sidewalk at all times.
      (4)   The licensee shall, in addition to all other requirements of law,
take reasonable steps to ensure that alcoholic beverages are consumed only by
patrons of the establishment who are of age, and not by passers-by or persons
who are not of age or who are obviously or apparently intoxicated.
      (5)   No disposable cups or drinking vessels may be used and the licensee
shall not permit any alcoholic beverages to be taken off premises by patrons,
customers or guests.
      (6)   No amplified sound shall be used within a sidewalk café. At no time
shall any music originating from any part of the premises create a nuisance.
      (7)   Dancing shall not be permitted or allowed in the sidewalk café.
      (8)   The licensee must at all times comply with all federal, state and
local laws regarding the sale, service and consumption of alcohol and the
operation of the premises.
      (9)   The permit for sidewalk café may not be assigned or transferred.
   (C)   No sidewalk café permit shall be effective unless the licensee has
filed with the City ABC Administrator evidence of insurance, insuring the
licensee against liability imposed by law arising out of the ownership,
maintenance or operation of such sidewalk café, in an amount to be established
by the City Attorney and the City Safety Coordinator. The city shall be named
an additional insured in the policy required. Such insurance policy shall
further provide expressly that it may not be canceled except upon ten days’
written notice (or more) filed with the ABC Administrator and the City
Attorney.

CHAPTER 117: CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS
Section
   
117.01   FCC rate regulations
   
117.02   Rate filing submission
   
117.03   Notice of filing
 
   
117.99   Penalty
§ 117.01 FCC RATE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The city will follow the FCC rate regulations in its regulation of the
basic service rates and charges of the company and any other cable television
system operating in the city, notwithstanding any different or inconsistent
provisions in the franchise.
   (B)   In connection with such regulations, the city will ensure a reasonable
opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.
   (C)   The Mayor, or his or her designee, is authorized to execute on behalf
of the city and file with the FCC such certification form or other instruments
as are now or may hereafter be required by the FCC rate regulations in order to
enable the city to regulate basic service rates and charges.
(Ord. 94-001, passed 2-14-1994)
§ 117.02 RATE FILING SUBMISSION.
   An operator that is notified that its basic service and equipment rates are
subject to regulation must file a submission (“the rate filing”) within 30 days
of the notification, justifying its then-existing basic service and equipment
rates. All rates for all customer classifications must be justified. Once an
operator has been so notified by the city that its rates for basic service or
equipment are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter increase its rates
for basic service or equipment without the prior approval of the city. This
requirement applies in all cases, including with respect to increases in rates
announced prior to the date the operator was notified its rates were subject to
regulation, where the increases were not implemented prior to the date of
notice. An operator must submit a rate filing to justify any increase in basic
service or equipment rates or any new basic services or equipment rates
(collectively referred to herein as “rate increases”). An increase occurs when
there is an increase in rates or a decrease in program or customer services.
Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for review
at least 30 days in advance of the proposed effective date of the increase.
This requirement does not alter or eliminate any other notice requirement. To
facilitate providing notice of filings to the public, an operator shall give
the Mayor of the city notice by facsimile machine, or hand delivery, of its
intent to make a filing at least three days before the filing is made. Every
rate filing must be submitted to the Mayor. A rate filing shall be considered
filed for review on the date the rate filing and all required copies are
received by the Mayor. Seven copies of each rate filing (including all
supporting materials) must be submitted. Subject to any FCC regulations
governing the burden of proof, a rate filing submitted by an operator must show
that the rates the operator proposes to charge for basic service and equipment
are reasonable. If the operator seeks to support a rate based upon a cost of
service, the city will establish a rate that provides the operator an
opportunity to recover the reasonable costs associated with providing basic
cable service, including a reasonable profit. An expense or investment is not
presumed reasonable merely because the operator has incurred or made it. An
operator is not entitled to recover monopoly rents in any form. In addition to
the information the city requires the operator to provide, and unless the city
grants a waiver of this provision, an operator who seeks to justify all or any
part of its rates based upon its cost of service must submit a complete cost of
service analysis that shows all expenses it incurs and all revenues derived
from the system, directly or indirectly, by the operator or any person that
constitutes a cable operator of the system within the meeting of 47 U.S.C. §
522(5).
(Ord. 94-001, passed 2-14-1994)
§ 117.03 NOTICE OF FILING.
   (A)   The Mayor shall promptly publish a notice of a filing and that, except
for those parts which may be withheld as confidential, it will be available for
public review. The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on
the filing and shall provide interested parties seven days to submit written
comments on the filing to the Mayor. The Mayor shall submit the comments
received and its recommendations for action to the City Council no later than
20 days after the filing and shall make those recommendations available for
public inspection. The operator may submit a response to public comments or the
Mayor’s recommendations, but must do so no later than three business days after
the Mayor notifies the operator that comments and recommendations have been
submitted to the City Council. The response shall be filed with the Mayor, and,
if submitted in a timely fashion, the Mayor shall forward a copy to the City
Council. Within 30 days of the date of the filing, the City Council shall issue
a written order (“initial rate order”), which may be in any lawful form,
approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in
whole or in part; or tolling the proposed rate in whole or part. If the Council
tolls the rate in whole or in part, its written order shall explain that it
requires additional time to review the rate filing and state that the operator
may cure any deficiency in its filing by submitting a supplementary filing
within 20 days.
   (B)   For the purpose of this section, and with respect to existing rates,
TOLLING means the rates may remain in effect, subject to refunds; with respect
to rate changes, TOLLING means the portion of the rate change that is tolled
may not go into effect.
(Ord. 94-001, passed 2-14-1994)
§ 117.99 PENALTY.
   The failure of the operator to comply in good faith with this chapter will
constitute a misdemeanor and subject the operator to a fine of $500 and/or 12
months imprisonment and a civil penalty equal to cost or damages which may be
proven by the city for violating this provision.

(Ord. 2023-018, passed 1-9-2024)
§ 154.16 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   The city reserves the right to develop or adopt other guidance
documents to serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance
documents distributed by the city should be reviewed and considered when
preparing design and maintenance plans.
   (B)   Checklists, technical manuals, administrative or procedural matters
may be modified as needed to meet the objectives of this chapter; provided,
that said modifications are consistent with the intent of this chapter and the
requirements of the state.
   (C)   The following criteria, along with accompanying technical manuals and/
or guidance documents as mentioned above, shall be implemented when designing
improvements with respect to managing stormwater runoff.
      (1)   Methods of determining stormwater runoff discharge rate and volume.
The volume of required stormwater storage and discharge rate for drainage areas
totaling 100 acres or less shall be calculated on the basis of the runoff from
a 25-year frequency storm event with a 24-hour duration for pre- and post-
development conditions. The calculations can be made in accordance with the
instantaneous runoff factor method, the rational method, soil conservation
service (SCS) method or other methods that may be deemed appropriate by the
city. The Intensity Duration Curves for Louisville MSP may be used for the
city. For larger drainage systems, the SCS hydrologic methods or the regional
method of the State Transportation Cabinet, Department of Highways shall be
used to determine peak runoff rates.
      (2)   Release rate.
         (a)   All developments undertaken as outlined in this section shall be
done in such a way as to ensure that stormwater falling on a given site shall
be absorbed or detained on site to the extent that the controlled release rate
of stormwater runoff from all developments described in §
154.15(A) shall not exceed the pre-development stormwater runoff rate, unless
it can be shown that no significant adverse downstream impacts will result from
higher rates. The rate at which stormwater runoff is delivered to a designated
stormwater storage area shall be unrestricted.
         (b)   In the event that the city determines that the natural
downstream channel or storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate the
release rate provided above, then the allowable release rate shall be reduced
to that rate permitted by the capacity of the downstream channel or storm sewer
system.
      (3)   Development design.
         (a)   Where it can be demonstrated by the developer that a higher
stormwater release rate will not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this
chapter and where such proposed release rate will not adversely affect
properties in the downstream portion of the watershed, the city may permit such
release to be used as deemed appropriate.
         (b)   Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be
located and laid out in such a manner as to minimize the velocity of overland
flow and allow maximum opportunity for infiltration of stormwater into the
ground, and to preserve and utilize existing and planned streams, channels and
detention basins, and include, whenever possible, streams and floodplain within
parks and other public grounds.
      (4)   Excess stormwater passage.
         (a)   An excess stormwater passage shall be provided for all
stormwater areas. Such passage shall have the capacity to convey through the
proposed development the excess stormwater. The capacity for a passage shall be
such that it will be able to transport the peak rate of run-off from a 100-
year, 24-hour return frequency storm.
         (b)   There shall be no buildings or structures constructed within
excess stormwater passage or within the elevation of the flood of record.
Parking lots, playgrounds and park areas which shall not impair or endanger the
water holding capability of a development shall be considered compatible uses.
         (c)   Appropriate land planning shall be undertaken to preserve the
existing natural drainage of a proposed development as part of the excess
stormwater passage.
         (d)   Open channels shall be protected from erosion by appropriate
vegetative cover, lining or other treatment and earthen channel side slopes
shall be no steeper than three to one (3:1). Open channels with lining shall
have a maximum gradient on side slopes of 67%, and channel side slopes steeper
than 67% shall be designed as structural retaining walls. Refer to the State
Transportation Center’s BMP Manual for controlling erosion, sediment and
pollutant runoff to protect channels with steep side slopes or set on a steep
gradient.
      (5)   Stormwater storage/detention areas. The increased stormwater runoff
resulting from the proposed development may be accommodated by the provision of
appropriate detention facilities, including wet or dry bottom reservoirs, flat
roofs, parking lots or streets. Storage areas shall be designed to the
satisfaction of the city and if possible, to provide secondary purposes for
recreation, open spaces, parking lot or other types of use that will not be
adversely affected by intermittent flooding. The following shall govern the
design of detention facilities.
         (a)   Storage volume.
            1.   All stormwater storage areas must be designed to contain and
safely pass stormwater runoff. The combined capacity of these storage areas
shall be sufficient to contain the stormwater from the development. The
detention facility must be designed for periodic maintenance and energy
dissipators shall be provided at points necessary.
            2.   The ponding of stormwater runoff shall not exceed a depth of
one foot on a pedestrian mall area or one and one-half feet maximum in parking
lots. Where these areas are used for ponding the maximum depth should occur in
the most remote and least used areas.
            3.   The drainage and grading design shall be prepared to ensure
that in a 100-year storm the depth of water run-off in any street, alley or
pedestrian mall will not exceed the level of the first floor of any building.
The finished floor elevation shall be set two feet above the 100-year flood
elevation for all new development, and the minimum finished floor elevations
for homes shall be stated on the record plat.
            4.   For wet pond storage areas when calculating the storage
capacity, only the volume available to store excess stormwater shall be
considered. Permanent water storage does not constitute control of excess storm
runoff.
         (b)   Release rate. At no time during the design storm shall the
stormwater runoff release rate exceed the allowable release rate as set forth
in division (C)(2) above. Detention basins shall be fully discharged within 36
hours of the end of the storm event.
         (c)   Release velocity. Detention facilities shall release stormwater
at a non-erosive velocity. The protected channel receiving the detention
discharge shall incorporate features to reduce velocity to non-erosive levels
at the point where such discharge enters the unprotected channel. If release is
into a subsurface conduit the energy gradient in the receiving facility shall
not be increased beyond the slope of the conduit.
         (d)   Spillway.
            1.   Overflow for each stormwater storage area shall be provided in
the event a storm in excess of the design capacity occurs. Such overflows hall
be constructed to function without specific attention and shall become part of
the excess stormwater passage.
            2.   Emergency spillways shall be provided to permit the safe
passage of runoff generated from a 100-year, 24-hour storm or greater if
required by state law. The spillway dimensions shall be clearly dimensioned and
protected from erosion.
            3.   Where rooftop storage or excess stormwater is provided, the
building shall be provided with adequate structural design to ensure that roof
failure does not occur. Overflow areas shall be provided so that the weight of
stored stormwater will not exceed the structural capacity of the roof.
         (e)   Dam. The dam slopes shall not exceed three to one (3:1) on the
interior of the pond. The minimum width of the top of dam shall be two feet,
and the back side of the dam shall not exceed a slope of two to one (2:1).
Detention/retention pond dams built with the maximum allowable slope may be
required to utilize erosion control blankets or other means beyond seed straw
to stabilize the slopes.
         (f)   Basin slope. Dry basins shall have a minimum 1% bottom drainage
slope to allow for positive drainage during and immediately following a rain
event. For dry basins with bottom slopes less than 2%, a paved channel is
required.
      (6)   Sinkholes and subterranean water channels.
         (a)   The use of sinkholes or subterranean water channels for direct
drainage of excess stormwater shall not be permitted although they may be used
to drain a stormwater storage area. The introduction of any foreign matter or
the filling, clogging or interfering with the natural drainage capabilities of
the sinkholes shall not be permitted.
         (b)   Any person, firm or corporation proposing alterations,
improvements or other disturbances of any sinkholes or known subterranean water
channel must submit plans to the city showing that said alterations,
improvements or disturbance would not interfere with the drainage capability.
Also, erosion control methods must be shown for any activities which might
create erosion or sedimentation and must be included in the plans.
         (c)   Sinkholes shall not be altered in any way which would negatively
affect the drainage capabilities of the sinkhole. Development within the 100-
year floodplain of a sinkhole shall not be permitted.

   (B)   Storm sewer outfall. The storm sewer outfall shall be designed to
provide adequate protection against downstream erosion and scouring.
   (C)   Lot lines. Whenever the plans call for the passage and/or storage of
stormwater runoff along lot lines, the grading of all such lots shall be
prescribed and established for the passage and/or storage of waters, and no
structure or vegetation which would obstruct the flow of stormwater shall be
allowed, nor shall any change be made to the prescribed grades and contours of
the specified stormwater channels.
   (D)   Manholes. All utility sewer manholes constructed in an area designed
for the storage or passage of stormwater shall be provided with either a
watertight manhole cover or be constructed with a rim elevation of a minimum of
one foot above the high water elevation of the design storm.
   (E)   Easements. Permanent easements for the detention and conveyance of
stormwater, including easements of access to structures and facilities, shall
be dedicated to the city.
   (F)   Drainage obstruction. The keeping or disposal of grass clippings,
trash, debris, obstructions or unwanted materials into the storm sewers or
within or along stormwater channels or in adjacent floodplain areas which may
wash into sewers and channels, is prohibited.
   (G)   Maintenance. Required maintenance for detention basins or other
structures shall be permanently provided by the developer with responsibility
becoming that of the private landowner after complete development, subject to
inspection by the city or duly authorized representative. Every detention basin
or structure shall be legally defined on both deed and plat and the maintenance
entity shall be specified. Refer to §
154.31.

BONDS, MAINTENANCE, ASSURANCES; FEES
§ 154.30 PERFORMANCE BONDS AND OTHER ASSURANCES.
   Upon approval of the stormwater management plan but before the issuance of a
building permit or subdivision plat approval, the city shall require the
applicant to either complete all required improvements or the applicant shall
post a performance bond, cash escrow, certified check, letter of credit or
other acceptable form of performance security in an amount sufficient to ensure
the execution of the plan. After determination by the city or designee that all
facilities are constructed in compliance with the approved plan, the
performance bond or other securities shall be released.
(Ord. 2023-018, passed 1-9-2024)
§ 154.31 MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.
   (A)   General. Individual property owners, whether residential or
commercial, shall be responsible for the general and overall maintenance of the
drainage easements and the street right-of-way ditch. Such maintenance includes
mowing, keeping the drainway free of leaves and debris and following the
guidelines within this section. Property owners shall install and maintain
their permitted entrance pipe. The pipe shall be kept free of debris, and
excess sediment that builds up over time, which constricts the flow of the
street runoff. No one shall fill-in the right-of-way ditch or any drainage way
without first obtaining a land disturbance permit. All proposed piping of
ditches shall be appropriately sized and may be required to have a catch basin
to allow for intake of surface water. The property owner shall ensure that
adequate vegetation remains in the drainway and provide a hardened surface
where applicable to prevent erosion.
   (B)   Stormwater maintenance agreement. A stormwater maintenance agreement,
approved by the city, assuring perpetual maintenance of stormwater management
improvements, including post-construction BMPs, shall be executed by the
applicants to the city. The agreement shall be recorded among the deed records
in the County Clerk’s office upon final plan approval. The agreement shall be a
covenant running with the land and shall be binding on the landowner, its
administrators, executors, heirs, assigns and any other successors of interest,
including any homeowner’s association. A copy of an appropriate maintenance
agreement can be obtained from the city.
      (1)   Operation and maintenance of all stormwater quality and quantity
devices, BMPs and drainage ways shall be the responsibility of the property
owner. Operation and maintenance shall be required sufficient to maintain
proper function and water quality at the discharge point.
      (2)   Routine inspections are the responsibility of property owner to
ensure the stormwater facilities/BMPs are operating and functioning as designed
and that required maintenance activities have occurred.
      (3)   The city and its agents shall have the right of entry to inspect,
observe, test or perform any other related activity to the operation,
maintenance and function of the stormwater infrastructure. The city has the
right to perform inspections and emergency maintenance on the facilities;
however, it is not the city’s obligation to maintain the stormwater quality/
quantity facility.
(Ord. 2023-018, passed 1-9-2024)
§ 154.32 FEES AND SECURITY.
   (A)   Permits.
      (1)   Land disturbance permit. A land disturbance permit must be obtained
from the city when land disturbance activities are to be performed for sites,
as defined per the city’s fee schedule for land disturbance activities,
hereafter referred to as “fee schedule.”
      (2)   Encroachment permit. An encroachment permit must be obtained from
City Hall when any work is to be performed in the city right-of-way. The permit
shall cover only one specified encroachment activity. Such right-of-way
encroachments include permanent or temporary entrances, installation or repair
of sidewalks, curb cuts, ditch work or any other activities in the public
right-of-way that may impact proper drainage or damage public infrastructure. A
drawing, sketch and/or description of the work shall be provided. All work must
be done in accordance with all city ordinances, regulations and standards.
Refer to regulations relating to streets, curbs and sidewalks in Chapter 157
for more information. Future maintenance of the encroachment is the
responsibility of the permit holder.
      (3)   Time frame. The permit holder shall have 12 months (one year) from
date of permit issuance to construct the entrance, encroachments and/or land-
disturbing activities in accordance with the permit. Failure to complete the
work properly within this one-year time frame shall be reasons for forfeiture
of the bond. If the work is not completed properly within the one-year time
frame, no further permits will be issued to the permit holder until the
property comes into compliance with this chapter. Extensions may be approved by
the City Engineer or designee.
      (4)   Bonds. A minimum performance bond shall accompany the submittal of
each permit as required. Bond values shall be no less than $500 as described in
the fee schedule and shall be an amount sufficient enough to cover the cost of
the improvements as approved by the city. Such items to be bonded may include,
but are not limited to, erosion control measures and their maintenance,
construction of stormwater facilities as described in this chapter, all
encroachment work, including entrances, sidewalks, curb cuts, utility crossings
and the like. The bond is fully refundable provided all improvements are
constructed as specified on the permit and the approved improvement plans. The
design engineer shall submit certifications for detention ponds and other
control facilities, as required, to the city. A representative from the city
shall inspect the completed work to ensure all areas within the public right-
of-way and stormwater facilities have vegetation established and are
functioning as designed before releasing the bond.
      (5)   Permit fees. All land disturbance and encroachment permits shall
have a permit fee to cover administrative and inspection costs which shall be
not less than $25 and no more than $5,000. All permit fees are due at the time
of application and shall be assessed according to the fee schedule.
      (6)   Late fee. A late fee shall be assessed to permits when construction
activities begin prior to the land disturbance permit being issued. The late
fee shall be equal and in addition to the original permit fee (i.e., late fee
equals original permit fee; revised permit fee equals late fee plus original
permit fee).
   (B)   Review fees. Projects that must go through the plan review process
shall be charged a review fee per the fee schedule. Review fees shall be not
less than $25 and no more than $5,000. All review fees are due at the time of
plan submittal. No permits shall be issued until all review fees have been
paid.
      (1)   For new residential, commercial and industrial developments that
require a SWPPP and/or SWMP per this section, review fees shall be assessed
according to the fee schedule.
      (2)   Review of development plans where infrastructure will be taken over
by the city and become part of the public road and/or utility systems (i.e.,
water, sewer, street and the like), additional plan review fees shall be
assessed according to the fee schedule.
      (3)   Incomplete plans and/or submittal packages will not be reviewed
until all required documents have been received by the city. Plans and/or
documents of the submittal package requiring major revisions may be assessed a
resubmittal fee equal to one-half the original review fee. Revisions that take
place after approval and issuance of the land disturbance permit may be
assessed the same resubmittal fee.
   (C)   Recording fees. For sites that require documents to be recorded by the
County Clerk’s office, recording fees will be charged per the County Clerk’s
fee schedule for land records. Such documents may include, but are not limited
to, deed of easements, maintenance agreements, subdivision agreements and the
like. The city will handle recording on behalf of the permittee and will
collect fees at the time of plan submittal.
   (D)   Establishment of Stormwater Management Fund.
      (1)   The stormwater management program is established and the stormwater
system is provided to protect the waterways and land in the city by managing
flooding and to benefit the natural environment. The costs of designing,
developing, improving, operating, maintaining and monitoring the stormwater
system required in the city should, therefore, be allocated, to the extent as
practicable, to all property owners. In order to provide revenue to fund those
costs and to fairly allocate those costs, a Stormwater Management Fund (“the
Fund”) is established.
      (2)   All revenues collected from the stormwater management fee from
grants, permit fees and other charges collected under the stormwater management
program, shall be deposited to the Fund. The City Council may make additional
appropriations to the Fund. All disbursements from the Fund shall be for the
purposes of the Fund as set forth in division (E).
   (E)   Purposes of the Fund. The Fund shall be used for the following
purposes:
      (1)   The acquisition by gift, purchase or condemnation of real and
personal property, and interests therein, necessary to construct, operate and
maintain stormwater management facilities;
      (2)   All costs of administration and implementation of the stormwater
management program, including the establishment of reasonable operating and
capital reserves to meet unanticipated or emergency stormwater management
requirements;
      (3)   Engineering and design, debt service and related financing
expenses, construction costs for new facilities, amid enlargement or

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 154.45 COMPLIANCE.
   Before starting any activities regulated by this chapter, an applicant shall
comply with the requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances with
respect to the submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision
plats, improvement plans, building and zoning permits, inspections, appeals and
similar matters, along with those set forth in this chapter and as may be
required by state statutes and the regulations of any department of the state.
(Ord. 2023-018, passed 1-9-2024)
§ 154.46 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Standards. Variances from these standards, provisions and
specifications may be granted when it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the City Council that, owing to special conditions, a strict adherence to the
provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship and that the
spirit and intent of the ordinance will be observed.
   (B)   Procedure. A written request for variance shall be filed by the owner,
seeking to develop or change the use of his or her property, or his or her
agent with the city and shall state specifically what variance is sought and
the public’s interest in granting the variance. The applicant must specify
hardships to result in following the prescribed regulations. The city must then
examine and decide the validity of the proposed hardships. This request is then
submitted to the City Council by the city along with a recommendation about
granting the variance.
      (1)   The variance will be granted only upon showing that there is good
and sufficient cause and that the failure to grant a variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant. Financial hardship to the property
owners does not constitute appropriate grounds for a variance under this
chapter.
      (2)   A record of all variance actions shall be maintained by the city,
including the justification for issuance.
      (3)   Variances may be considered for the reconstruction, rehabilitation
or restoration of structures listed on the State Inventory of Historic Places.
(Ord. 2023-018, passed 1-9-2024)
§ 154.47 OFFICIAL MAPS AND PROFILES.
   Responsibility for all changes to official maps and profiles remains with

determine if control measures are adequate.
      (4)   The inspector with the city shall complete a report after each
inspection and keep it on file in City Hall.
      (5)   Inspections will be made a minimum of every 30 days until all land-
disturbing activities have been completed and permanently stabilized or until
the NOT with the State Division of Water has been issued. If deficiencies are
noted, more frequent inspections will be made. See §
154.50.
   (B)   Permit holder requirements.
      (1)   The permit holder must have a qualified inspector making
inspections weekly. Bi-weekly inspections are allowed if inspections are also
performed within 24 hours after one-half-inch rain events or larger.
      (2)   Inspectors shall have training in stormwater construction
management as recognized by the current KYR1000000 permit requirements.

         (h)   Any changes in SWPPP or BMP;
         (i)   Recommendations for correction of deficiencies; and
         (j)   Signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in 401 KAR
5:065.
      (4)   Refer to the KPDES permit, KYR100000, part II, § 7, entitled
“Inspections” for further information on inspection requirements.
(Ord. 2023-018, passed 1-9-2024)
§ 154.49 CERTIFICATION.
   At the completion of the improvements approved in the stormwater management
plan, the applicant shall provide to the city a certification by a professional
engineer that the improvements have generally been built in conformance with
the plan. No certificate of occupancy will be issued or performance bond
released prior to receipt of certification.
(Ord. 2023-018, passed 1-9-2024)
§ 154.50 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   The city, in conjunction with the City Public Works and Code Enforcement,
shall be responsible for the enforcement of this chapter. Duly authorized
representatives have the authority to issue notices of violation, stop-work
orders and levy fines. Enforcement actions shall be served to the property
owner as listed on the permit or most current property owner as held by the PVA
office.
   (A)   Notice of deficiency (NOD). If any site violates the conditions of
this chapter when inspected by the city’s authorized representative, a NOD
shall be issued to the violator. The NOD may be verbal or written to either NOI
holder or the property owner. The violator shall be given seven calendar days,
or as directed by the city or designee, to correct the deficiency per the
details as specified in the NOD.
   (B)   Notice of violation (NOV). A written NOV shall be issued to either the
holder of the NOI or the owner(s) of the site, when previously sited, does not
comply with the terms of the NOD within the time period given. The violator
shall be given five calendar days to correct the deficiency per the details as
specified in the NOV. The city’s authorized representative has the right to
modify the time frame for corrections based on his or her judgment, due to
project conditions.
   (C)   Stop-work order (SWO). A stop-work order shall be issued to anyone
previously cited with an NOV that does not comply with the terms or the
violation within the time frame given. All work on the site shall stop except
for activities necessary to correct the violation. The violator shall be given
seven days, or as directed, to correct the deficiency per the details of stop-
work order. Upon completion of remediated actions as inspected the city, then
the stop-work order shall be rescinded, and work can continue on the site.
      (1)   If the holder of the NOI or property owner does not comply with the
stop-work order conditions within the time period specified, the violator will
be penalized as specified in §
154.99. The city may also perform the remedial work and make claim against the
permit holder to recover its expenses and costs.
      (2)   For violations where no permit has been issued, the office of the
city will notify the property owner and cooperate for resolution prior to
enforcement. Should the owner not cease the land-disturbing activities or
demonstrate a history of noncompliance of the same nature, the city may request
the City Attorney to seek injunctive relief as described in §
154.99.
      (3)   The city may deny the issuance of any permits for any project or
property to an applicant when it determines that the applicant is not in
compliance with the provisions of any land disturbance permit or approved
stormwater management or erosion and sediment control plan, or has failed to
comply with any other provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   The city is authorized to require immediate abatement of any
violation of this chapter that constitutes an immediate threat to the health,
safety or well-being of the public. If any violation is not abated immediately,
the city is authorized to enter onto private or public property and to take any
and all measures required to remediate the violation. Any expense related to
such remediation undertaken by the city shall be fully reimbursed by the
property owner and/or responsible party. The cost of remediation plus any
administrative and attorneys’ fees shall be billed to the owner. Failure to
reimburse the city within 30 days will result in a lien being placed on the
property.
   (D)   Appeals. A permit holder or property owner may appeal an enforcement
action to the City Council within 15 days of the date of notification. The
appeal shall be made in writing to the Mayor. The Mayor may then allot time at
a regular Council meeting or call a special meeting where the owner or permit
holder shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and he or she may call
witnesses and present evidence on his or her behalf. After such meeting, if the
City Council concludes that the issuance of additional correction notices would
be futile, any bonds or cash deposits posted with the city shall be forfeited,
whereupon said security shall be used for completion of the stormwater
management plan as approved.
(Ord. 2023-018, passed 1-9-2024)
§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm or corporation who violates or fails to comply with any of
the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $25, nor more than
$250, and, in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case.
Violators of this chapter may be issued a citation by the officer in charge of
enforcement.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS 82.082 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council hereby adopts the following floodplain management
ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood
damage.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as: water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets; and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
    (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   A1-30 AND AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   A99 ZONE. The part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO AND AR/A ZONES. Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three
feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination
of both. In A ZONES, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are
usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base
flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Arens of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year. (Also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD.) BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate
map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH and AR/AO
that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1%
or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally above ground,
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank or other human-made
facility or infrastructure. See STRUCTURE.
   C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES. Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated or qualified community
official) from available technical studies, historical information and other
available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by
floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular
program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not
limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to
avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations; vehicle and
equipment storage facilities; emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during and after a flood; public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood; and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   D ZONE. An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls,
piling, columns (post and piers), shear walls or breakaway walls. (See
freeboard requirements for residential and nonresidential structures.)
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A statement certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor on the FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification that verifies a structure’s elevation and other related
information to verify compliance with this chapter.

commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to
as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the city based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD. The flood that has a 0.2% chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-YEAR FLOOD have a moderate to
low risk of flooding.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD, FLOODING or FLOODWATER.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (mudflows). See MUDSLIDES (MUDFLOWS).
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (mudflow) and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing
flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and/or the flood boundary
floodway map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by an NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by floodwaters from any source.

preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinance s and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a nonresidential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. The area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory
floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/
or hydrologic analysis.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
155.27, a requirement that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100
years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components and the like.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality that

health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood-routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).
      (1)   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish
or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC COVERAGE is available on residential and nonresidential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.

drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the cabinet, by regulation, may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to require
approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the state
shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris or any other material,
or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building, barrier or
obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or stream or in
the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising or obstruction will in
any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the floodway of the
stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been submitted to and
approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in division (1) of this
definition.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources, through KRS Chapter 350, shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.

constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM.
      (1)   A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.

letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel.
The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first
revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or
adjusted assessed values.

inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is in
progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator only
if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that
occurs.

conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD). The flood that has a 1% or greater
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that
begins with the letter A is subject to the 100-YEAR FLOOD. Over the life of a

§ 155.06 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas (SFHA), areas
applicable to KRS 151.250 and, as determined by the Floodplain Administrator or
other delegated, designated or qualified community official as determined by
the City Council from available technical studies, historical information and
other available and reliable sources, areas within the jurisdiction of the City
Council which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens
of the city.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) for the county,
dated February 17, 2010, with the accompanying flood insurance rate maps
(FIRMS), other supporting data and any subsequent amendments thereto, are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations by
the city, and for those land areas acquired by the city through annexation.
This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this
chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow
implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by
the Floodplain Administrator and were enacted by City Council pursuant to
statutes governing land use management regulations. The FIS and/or FIRM are
permanent records of the city and are on file and available for review by the
public during regular business hours at the City Hall.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.08 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable state regulations. Violation of the
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein
shell prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violation.

§ 155.10 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.11 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter
shall riot create liability on the part of the City Council of the city, any
officer or employee, the state, the Federal Insurance Administration or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 155.25 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (A)   (1)   A development permit shall be required in conformance with the
provision of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in the special flood hazard areas (SFHA). See division (B) below for
instructions and explanation.
      (2)   Application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or
other development begins within any special flood hazard area established in
division (A) above. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities and
may include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of the local
Administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
      (1)   Application stage.
         (a)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade;
         (b)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure will be floodproofed;
         (c)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet
the floodproofing criteria in §§
155.41(B) and
155.43(B); and
         (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      (2)   Construction stage.
         (a)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duly of the permit bolder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH and A
Zones where the Community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
         (b)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall bent the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and
floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

permits may be required, and if specific federal or state permit requirements
are known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on
file with the development permit;
         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner; and
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For the purpose of this division (B)(1)(d),
ADVERSELY AFFECTS means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at
any point.
      (2)   Review end use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §

      (5)   Map determinations. The Administrator shall make interpretations,
where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the special flood
hazard areas, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
155.27(C)(2).
         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
155.07, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonable
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
155.40 through
155.46.
         (c)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the

§ 155.27 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create all exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare.
The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be
met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that
must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are
designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a
variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The City Council shall
establish an Appeal Board consisting of the City Council.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local circuit court, as provided in
state statutes.
   (D)    Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. For the purpose of this division (E), MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford
relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For
example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the
City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or
even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation
which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the
integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
155.05), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as defined in §
155.05) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of division (D)(1)
through (D)(11) above are satisfied and that the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a
public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the City Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
and
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures, as defined in §
155.05, upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 155.40 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
   (B)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
   (D)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition equipment
and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding and, if within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage
paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from
proposed structures.
   (F)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   (G)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
   (H)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (I)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure,
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet the
requirements of new construction as contained in this chapter.
   (J)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be
undertaken only if said nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
155.07, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and ductwork elevated no lower
than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with
standards of division (C) below:
      (1)   In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified;
      (2)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. As a
part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit, as provided
in 401 KAR Chapter 4, Regulation 060, the applicant shall provide cross-
sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby base flood
elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross-sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than five-tenths of a foot. Cross-
section elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross-section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the cabinet may require additional cross-sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations; and
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the Community Building Inspection
Department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or nonresidential structure
(including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) above or together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and
ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
elevation;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
155.25(B)(1)(c);
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) below;
and
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood-resistant materials below an
elevation one foot above the base flood elevation and shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin
1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts or pilings and the like that include
fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the
base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate room.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed
on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH and AB on the community’s flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring.
         (b)   Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels;
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; or
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood.
         (c)   All manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above
the level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
A1-30, AO, AH and AE on the community’s flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes.
         (b)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with state motor vehicle regulations, is on
its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
155.07 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply.
      (1)   The floodways shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other developments, unless
certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood
discharge.
      (2)   If this division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.42 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
155.07, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with §
155.07.
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.43 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
155.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable
und indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply.
    (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or, in Zone AO, the flood depth specified
on the flood insurance rate map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or, in Zone AO, the flood depth specified on
the flood insurance rate map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if
no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade; and
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as stated in §
155.41(B).
(Ord. 2009-006, passed 11-10-2009)
§ 155.44 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities,
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available
(Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is
the lesser, shall be provided.
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood
elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.

district. Vacated rights-of-way shall not affect the original zoning.
   (B)   Where a zoning district boundary approximately follows a platted lot
or property line, that line is the boundary or the district.
   (C)   Where a zoning district boundary follows a stream or the shore of a
body of water, that stream or shoreline is the boundary of the district, and in

lakes or other bodies of water, they shall be construed to follow such
centerlines.
   (E)   Boundaries indicated as approximately parallel to features indicated
in the divisions above shall so be construed; distances not specifically
indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the
map, if an accurate legal description cannot be determined. Where boundary
lines are established by zoning map amendment, the legal description used for
that zoning map amendment shall control.
   (F)   Where the lot in question is divided into two or more districts, the
entire area may be used in conformity with and is subject to the regulations
established for the most restrictive district in which any portion of the lot
is located.
   (G)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following political boundaries
shall be construed as following such boundaries.
   (H)   Where a zoning district boundary does not clearly follow any of the
features mentioned above, its exact location on the ground shall be determined
by measurement according to the map scale.
   (I)   In any case where the exact location of a boundary is unclear, and the
above stated rules do not indicate the exact locations of the zoning district
boundaries, then said boundaries shall be determined by the Administrative
Official and may be subject to appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustments. The
Administrative Official may also apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustments for
an original interpretation.

§ 156.039 AREAS UNASSIGNED TO A ZONING DISTRICT.
   Any area hereafter annexed into the city shall remain in the same district
as legally existed before annexation unless the district is specifically
changed by ordinance according to the requirements of the relevant provisions
of the state statutes pertaining to amendments. If the property lies in unzoned
territory, until annexation proceedings take place, the area is considered an
extension of the largest contiguous district. If the classification of such an
area is questionable, the Administrative Official may, upon approval by the
Planning Commission, refuse to issue zoning or other permits until the area is
assigned to a zoning district.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
USE REGULATIONS
§ 156.050 GENERALLY.
   The following general regulations will apply to all zoning districts.
   (A)   Uses.
Appendix A lists the uses allowed within zoning districts.
      (1)   Permitted uses (P). A “P” indicates that a use category is allowed
by right in the respective zoning district. These permitted uses are subject to
all other applicable regulations of this chapter.
      (2)   Conditional uses (C). A “C” indicates that a use category is
allowed only if reviewed and approved as a conditional use in accordance with
the conditional use permit procedures of §
156.131. Conditional uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of
this chapter and may have specific conditions set forth by the Board of
Adjustments.
      (3)   Prohibited uses. A blank or empty cell indicates that a use type is
not allowed in the respective zoning district, unless it is otherwise expressly
allowed by other regulations of this chapter. Any use not allowed or not listed
is deemed prohibited and detrimental to the development of the district.
      (4)   New or unlisted uses. If an application is submitted for a use type
that is not listed in the use table, the Zoning Administrator shall be
authorized to make a similar use interpretation based on the criteria set forth
below. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed use does not
fit any of the use descriptions of
Appendix A, no similar use interpretation shall be made. The Zoning
Administrator shall make a determination as to the use for the application that
has been made.
         (a)   The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in
relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category;
         (b)   The relative amount of the area of floor space and equipment
devoted to the activity;
         (c)   Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
         (d)   The customer type for each activity, retail or wholesale;
         (e)   The relative number of employees in each activity;
         (f)   Hours of operation;
         (g)   Building and site arrangement;
         (h)   Vehicles used with the activity;
         (i)   The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use;
         (j)   How the use advertises itself;
         (k)   Parking needs;
         (l)   Noise level, odor, dust, vibrations or smoke generated; and
         (m)   Utility use.
      (5)   Developments with multiple permitted uses. When all principal uses
of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is
assigned to that use category. When the principal uses of a development fall
within different use categories, then each use is subject to all applicable
regulations for that category.
      (6)   Accessory uses. Accessory uses are customarily incidental and
necessary to any permitted use and are allowed by right in conjunction with a
principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Accessory structures
shall not include any business, trade or industry, or any access driveway or
walkway thereto, unless clearly incidental to the permitted use. Also, unless
otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the
principal uses.
      (7)   Home occupations. Home occupations shall be permitted on a limited
basis in the residential districts. Permitted home occupations in these
districts are set forth in the use table in
Appendix A and may include academic tutoring, music lessons, catering,
childcare (with less than eight children attending), sewing/alterations/
tailoring/embroidery, hair salon/cosmetologist/barber and limited art/
photography studio. Permitted home occupations shall meet the standards of the
zoning district in which it is located.
   (B)   General development requirements and standards.
      (1)   Development plan. A development plan is intended to demonstrate the
character and objectives of the proposed development in adequate detail for the
Planning Commission to evaluate the effect of the proposed development on the
community and to determine what provisions, if any, shall be altered for the
protection and promotion of the general public health, safety and welfare. As a
condition to the granting of any zoning map amendment, the Planning Commission
is authorized to require the submission of a development plan. The development
plan shall be filed in accordance with the provisions and requirements of §§
156.110 through
156.112. Where agreed upon, this development plan shall be followed and shall
be binding on all parties.
      (2)   Water supply and sanitary sewage systems. All uses within the
corporate limits of the city shall be served by the public sanitary sewage
system, unless otherwise specified by the city. All uses within the corporate
limits of the city must have water supply either from an accessible water main,
or if no water main is reasonably accessible, then from a source approved by
the County Health Officer. All applications for building permit or certificate
of occupancy submitted to the Building Inspector shall be accompanied by the
County Health Officer’s certificate approving proposed and completed water and
sewage facilities.
      (3)   Principal and accessory buildings and structures. Unless a plat
and/or development plan has been approved for multi-building development, only
one principal building and accessory structures customarily incidental to any
permitted use shall be allowed per permitted lot. No accessory building shall
be used for residential purposes, except for necessary tenant dwellings
required for agricultural production on agriculturally exempt lots or those
qualifying as accessory dwelling units or tiny home hereunder.
      (4)   Lot area.
         (a)   Minimum lot area. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter,
lots served by a sanitary sewer shall have a minimum lot area of 7,500 square
feet, and lots not served by sanitary sewer shall have a minimum lot area of
30,000 square feet.
         (b)   Minimum lot area above 100-year flood level required. No lot
shall be created or developed which does not have at least 5,000 square feet of
lot area above the 100-year frequency flood level.
      (5)   Lot width. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, lots served
by sanitary sewer shall have a minimum lot width of 50 feet, and lots not
served by sanitary sewer shall have a minimum lot width of ten feet.
      (6)   Yards.
         (a)   Application of yards to one building only. No part of a yard
required for any building may be included as fulfilling the yard requirements
for an adjacent building.
         (b)   Use of yards for accessory buildings. No accessory buildings are
permitted in front or side yards. They are permitted only in the rear yards
according to the dimensions and area regulations set forth in the specific
zoning district regulations of this chapter.
         (c)   Rear dwelling prohibited. No building in the rear of a main
building on the same lot may be erected for residential purposes, except as
approved by the Board of Adjustments, those qualifying as an accessory dwelling
unit or tiny home hereunder, or in a multi-family residential district.
      (7)   Building line setbacks.
         (a)   Distance greater than minimum required. Building setback lines
as established by this subchapter may be greater than the minimums set forth.
         (b)   Front yard setback line. Unless otherwise specified in this
chapter, the minimum front yard setback line shall be one-half the width of the
street right-of-way, and in no case shall this distance be less than 30 feet.
Lots fronting on a cul-de-sac shall have a minimum 100-foot front yard setback
line. A waiver from strict enforcement of this front yard setback may be
granted by the Zoning Administrator where the majority of existing development
on the same block face is set back less than the required setback. In such
case, the front yard setback may be the average setback line for that block
face.
         (c)   Rear yard setback line. Unless otherwise specified in this
chapter, the minimum rear yard setback line shall be no less than 25 feet.
         (d)   Side yard setback line. Unless otherwise specified in this
chapter, the minimum side yard setback line shall be no less than eight feet.
         (e)   Additional setbacks for corner lots. Corner lots shall be
required to provide a front yard along any lot line abutting a street. Unless
the plat is expressly marked as to the street the dwelling will front, a rear
yard shall be substituted for any side yard not abutting a street. Corner lots
shall be required to provide a side yard abutting a street of at least 30 feet.
         (f)   Additional setbacks adjacent to parkways or other highways. Lots
that abut or are adjacent to a parkway or other fully controlled access
highways which allow no direct access shall have a minimum building setback
line from the right-of-way of said highway of 25 feet. This building line shall
be the same whether considered as front, side or rear setback.
      (8)   Building height.
         (a)   Maximum building height. Unless otherwise specified in this
chapter, no building shall exceed 45 feet in height.
         (b)   Height exceptions. Building height regulations apply to
buildings occupied regularly by persons or their activities. They do not apply
to structures or portions of buildings, such as church spires, belfries,
cupolas and domes not intended for human occupancy; monuments; water towers;
observation towers; flagpoles; or chimneys. The Board of Adjustments shall
interpret whether or not height regulations apply upon application by the
Administrative Official in doubtful cases. The Kentucky Airport Zoning and
Federal Aviation Agency height regulations in the vicinity of an airport shall
take precedence over all other height regulations.
      (9)   Access and visibility. All lots shall have access to a public
street and shall comply with the access and visibility requirements set forth
in the subdivision regulations. The Planning Commission shall approve access to
buildings in a planned unit development. Furthermore, in all but the Central
Commercial District, no obstructions to vision between a height of two and one-
half feet and ten feet above the imaginary plane defined by the following three
points of intersection are permitted: at the intersection of any two street
rights-of-way, of streets and railways, or of a straight line intersecting
those two rights-of-way at points thirty feet from the intersection.
      (10)   Accessory buildings and structures.

structures, except as otherwise permitted by this chapter, shall require the
issuance of a zoning permit and shall be subject to the following regulations.
Accessory buildings and structures shall not include mobile homes, buses,
travel trailers, recreational vehicles, trailers, coolers, vehicles or freight
containers. No accessory structure that is not designated to breakaway on
impact shall be permitted in the right-of-way. Such structures include, but are
not limited to, rock or brick mailbox structures. Any accessory structure may
be connected to the principal building by a breezeway or other similar
structure but shall not be considered as an attached accessory building,
carport or similar structure. Said breezeway shall not project nearer to the
side lot line than the minimum side yard required for the principal building.
         (b)   Setbacks. Accessory structures shall be not located in the front
yard and side yard and shall not extend beyond the principal structure.
Accessory structures shall be located behind and to the rear of the principal
structure. Accessory structures on corner lots adjoining residential uses or
districts shall not extend beyond the front of the principal structure or be
nearer to the side street than the depth of the required front setback for the
principal structure along such street.
         (c)   Height. The height of accessory structures shall not exceed the
height of the principal structure. This restriction does not apply to radio
towers, silos, flag poles or other structures which are not regularly occupied
by human beings. If in doubt as to applicability, the Board of Adjustments
shall interpret whether the structure in question is subject to height
restrictions.
         (d)   Size. The maximum size of accessory structures shall be 50% of
gross floor area of principal structure
         (e)   Fencing.
            1.   Height.

written permission from the city.
               b.   For all commercial or industrial zones, fencing of eight
feet or less is allowed in the front yard if neither solid nor opaque.
            2.   Materials. Fencing or screening constructed in front or side
yards abutting a public street must be constructed of materials not eliminating
or impeding view of the principal building from the public street and requires
Planning Commission approval for location, height, material and construction.
Chain link or wire fences shall not be permitted in the front yard of
residential zones.
            3.   Setbacks. Fences may be located as close as zero feet from all
adjoining property lines; however, care should be exercised in determining the
true and accurate location of said property boundary lines in advance of fence
placement.

heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at least
once, but may be published two or more times, in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county; provided that one publication occurs not less than
seven calendar days nor more than 21 days before the occurrence of such
hearing.
         (b)   Notice of such hearing shall be posted conspicuously on the
property in question for 14 consecutive days immediately prior to the hearing.
Said posting shall consist of one or more signs, constructed of durable
material, and clearly depicting the following information: (name of utility)

notice was mailed to an owner of every parcel of property within 500 feet of
the base of the proposed tower or monopole. It shall be the duty of the
applicant proposing the facility to furnish the Planning Commission with the
names and addresses of said property owners. Records maintained by the PVA may
be relied upon consecutively to determine the identity and address of said
owner. In the event such property is in a condominium or cooperative forms of
ownership, then the person notified by mail shall be the president or
chairperson owned by the condominium or cooperative owners. A joint notice may
be mailed to two or more co-owners of an adjoining property who are listed in
the PVA’s records as having the same address.
         (d)   Upon holding such hearing, the Planning Commission shall, within
60 days commencing from the date that the application is received by the
Planning Commission, or within a date specified in a written agreement between
the Planning Commission and the applicant, make its final decision to approve
or disapprove the uniform application. The Planning Commission shall submit to
the Public Service Commission, along with their action, the basis for their
decision. If the Planning Commission fails to issue a final decision within 60
days, and if there is no written agreement between the Planning Commission and
the utility to a specific date for the Planning Commission to issue a decision,
it is presumed that the Planning Commission has approved the utility’s uniform
application.
      (2)   Previously approved site.
         (a)   For facilities located on previously approved sites, the
Planning Commission’s Administrative Officer shall review the application for
its conformity with these regulations and all regulations contained with the

regulations contained within this chapter, a public hearing, pursuant to this
section, shall be scheduled.
   (F)   Design standards. At the time of the application submittal, the
applicant shall provide information demonstrating compliance with the following
requirements. Where the Planning Commission or its Administrative Official
finds that the circumstances or conditions relating to the particular
application are such that one or more of the requirements listed below are not
necessary or desirable for the protection of surrounding property or the public
health, safety and general welfare, and that such special conditions or
circumstances make one or more said requirements unreasonable, the Planning
Commission or its Administrative Official may modify or waive such requirement,
either permanently or on a temporary basis. The applicant shall request any
such modification or waiver, and the applicant shall submit a written
justification for each requested modification or waiver.
      (1)   All structures, except fences, shall be located at least 50 feet
from the property line or lease line of any residentially zoned property.
      (2)   A cellular antenna tower or alternative antenna tower structure may
be constructed to a maximum height of 200 feet. This also applies to any tower
taller than 15 feet constructed on the top of another building or structure,
with the height being the overall height of the building/structure and tower
together, measured from the grade to the highest point. The Planning Commission
may allow antennas greater than 200 feet in height upon review of the
applicant’s justification that the additional height meets the criteria
identified in this section.
      (3)   When any cellular antenna tower or alternative antenna tower
structure is taller than the distance from its base to the nearest property
line or lease line, the applicant shall furnish the Planning Commission with a
certification from an engineer registered in the Commonwealth that the tower
will withstand winds of 70 mph, in accordance with the current ANSI/EIA/TIA
standards.
      (4)   Cellular antenna towers shall not be illuminated, except in
accordance with other state and federal regulations.
      (5)   The site shall be unstaffed. Personnel may periodically visit the
site for maintenance, equipment modification or repairs. To accommodate such
visits, ingress/egress shall only be from approved access points.
      (6)   A minimum of one off-street parking space per provider shall be
provided on the site.
      (7)   A chain link (80% open) or solid fences made from wood or other
materials (less than 50% open) shall be used to enclose the site. Such fences
shall not be less than four feet in height nor more than eight feet in height.
The use of woven wire, barbed wire or sharp pointed fences shall be prohibited.
Such fences shall be located within the front, side or rear yard.
      (8)   Screening shall be required when the site in question abuts
residentially zoned property. Screening shall be provided by evergreen trees
planted in a staggered pattern at a maximum distance of 15 feet on center. The
screening shall be placed in an area between the property line, or lease line,
and a ten-foot setback.
      (9)   Any site to be purchased or leased for the installation of a
cellular antenna tower or alternative antenna tower and ancillary facilities
shall comply with the minimum lot size requirements of the zoning district in
which the facility is to be located provided that such area shall not be
required to exceed one-half acre.
      (10)   Surfacing of all driveways and off-street parking areas shall be
of either concrete or asphalt and shall comply with the requirements of this
chapter.
      (11)   There shall be no signs permitted, except those displaying
emergency information, owner contact information, warning or safety
instructions, or signs which are required by a federal, state or local agency.

criteria:
      (1)   Agreement with the various elements of the Comprehensive Plan and
where applicable, any other adopted plan or regulation;
      (2)   Extent to which the proposal is consistent with the purposes of
these regulations;
      (3)   Adequacy of the proposed site, considering such factors as the
sufficiency of the size of the site to comply with the established criteria,
the configuration of the site and the extent to which the site is formed by
logical boundaries (such as, topography, natural features, streets,
relationship of adjacent uses and the like);
      (4)   Extent to which the proposal responds to the impact of the proposed
development on adjacent land uses, especially in terms of visual impacts;
      (5)   Extent to which the proposed cellular antenna tower is camouflaged
(e.g., use of “stealth technology”); and
      (6)   Extent to which the proposed facility is integrated with existing
structures (e.g., buildings, structures and the like).
   (H)   Amendments. Any amendments to plans, except for minor adjustments as
determined by the Planning Commission or its Administrative Official, shall be
made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, subject to
the same limitations and requirements as those under which such plans were
originally approved,
   (I)   Guarantee. To ensure the removal of all improvements at any abandoned
telecommunications facility, any applicant filing a request under these
regulations shall, at the time of the submittal, deposit with the Planning
Commission, and to the benefit of the Planning Commission, a letter of credit,
performance bond or other security acceptable to the Planning Commission in the
amount equal to the cost of the demolition and removal of the facility. An
applicant having multiple telecommunications facilities within the Planning
Commission’s jurisdiction may deposit a single guarantee in the amount equal to
the cost of the demolition and removal of the one facility it owns which would
cost the most to demolish and remove until such time as the number of multiple
facilities exceeds four such facilities, the applicant shall increase the
amount on deposit to an amount equal to the cost of the most costly demolition
and removal plus 25% of the cost of demolition and removal of the applicant’s
other existing facilities. Any guarantee submitted shall be irrevocable and
shall provide for the Planning Commission to collect the full amount of the
guarantee if the applicant fails to maintain the guarantee.

§ 156.053 ACCESS POINTS.
   It is desirable that access points to the arterial streets serving all
zoning districts shall be located no more frequently than once every quarter
mile. Topography and traffic volumes shall determine the exact locations. Heavy
arterial traffic volumes demand greater access spacing. Along any arterial
street where subdivided land and its minor streets are not sufficiently
developed to permit acceptably spaced access points, the Planning Commission
may approve the platting of temporary access points and may require that
temporary access points shall be eliminated by the developer when minor streets
or marginal access streets are extended to the approved permanent access
points. Such requirements shall be listed as special conditions on the recorded
final plat. Access points shall also meet federal and state standards where
applicable.

§ 156.054 JUNKYARDS OR SALVAGE YARDS.
   Junkyards are not designated as permitted uses in any district and are
consequently non-conforming uses in all districts. They shall conform with §§
156.090 through
156.095 prescribing regulations for non-conforming uses. The Administrative
Official shall ensure that all existing junkyards maintain valid permits to
operate issued by the Kentucky Department of Highways, as required by KRS
177.905 through 177.990, and shall ensure that all screening required by the
Department of Highways is maintained as long as the junkyards remain in
operation.

§ 156.055 MANUFACTURED AND MOBILE HOME STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to provide the
minimum standards to safeguard the health, welfare and safety of the citizens
of the city by establishing standards for the placement of manufactured and
modular homes on individual lots or subdivision development lots in the city
and distinguishing between manufactured and modular homes and mobile homes.
   (B)   Standards.
      (1)   A manufactured or mobile home as defined in KRS 227.550, which does
not bear a seal certifying that it was manufactured in accordance with the
Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act and not bearing
either a Class A or B Seal issued by the Kentucky Department of Housing,
Building and Construction, Office of the State Fire Marshal is not acceptable
for residential occupation.
      (2)   Establishment, location and use of manufactured homes as scattered
site residences shall be permitted in agriculturally exempt areas and
residential zones permitting installation of a single-family dwelling unit
applying generally to such residential use in the district, subject to the
following additional requirements:
         (a)   Permanent foundation system shall be anchored in accordance with
the state standards set forth in KRS 227.570;
         (b)   Exterior material shall be material customarily used on site-
built dwellings, such as board siding, plywood or presswood siding, vinyl,
stucco, brick, non-reflective aluminum and the like, and shall be compatible
with the conventionally built residential structures in the neighborhood;
         (c)   Roofing material shall be of wood, tile, composition shingles or
other materials compatible with the conventionally built residential structures
in the neighborhood that shall be installed on a surface appropriately pitched
for the materials used;
         (d)   Exterior covering material extending to the ground or the top of
the foundation shall be used. Skirting materials shall be used and be
compatible with the conventionally built residential structures in the
neighborhood;
         (e)   Structural additions or alterations shall be subject to the same
regulations and requirements and procedures, including any applicable zoning
permit or state building permit that must be complied with to obtain such a
permit for additions or alterations to a conventionally built house;
         (f)   Manufactured homes in a manufactured home communities or mobile
homes in mobile home parks shall conform to the requirements as prescribed in
902 KAR 15:010 for manufactured and mobile home communities; and
         (g)   Manufactured homes not conforming to the requirements of this
section shall be permitted in the MHP District designed only for permitting
mobile homes.
   (C)   Permitted placement of mobile homes.
      (1)   Class A and B mobile homes may be placed in manufactured home
community or mobile home park as a permitted residential unit type and in
accordance with this chapter and the subdivision regulations.
      (2)   Class A and B mobile homes may also be placed in the Agricultural
District for use as a tenant dwelling with the issuance of a conditional use
permit by the Board of Adjustments and in accordance with this chapter and the
subdivision regulations.
      (3)   Manufactured homes with no HUD Code seal and mobile homes with no
Class A or B seal are not permitted in any zoning district or in mobile home
parks. Those which at the time of the adoption of this chapter are located
within the jurisdiction are non-conforming uses, subject to the same
requirements as any other non-conforming use.
   (D)   Permits.
      (1)   If building permits are required for other single-family
residential dwellings, building permits for manufactured homes shall be issued,
providing that the other requirements for the zoning district are met, upon
presentation of certification either by the United States Department of Housing
and Urban Development or the Kentucky Department of Housing, Building and
Construction, Office of the State Fire Marshal, that the home has been
constructed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety
Standards Act. Inspection shall be limited to the foundation of any accessory
additions, such as porches, basements, or other added or altered structures.
      (2)   If building permits are required for other single-family
residential dwellings, building permits for Class A and Class B mobile homes
shall be issued where permitted upon receipt of certification that they are
Class A or Class B mobile homes and after compliance with all the other
provisions of this chapter and the subdivision regulations. Inspection shall be
limited to the foundation and other on-site improvements, if any.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 156.056 OFF-STREET AND ON-STREET PARKING AND LOADING/UNLOADING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Off-street parking requirements.
      (1)   General. Off-street parking shall be provided with vehicular access
to the public right-of-way and shall conform to the regulations set forth in
this section. The off-street parking requirements and ingress/egress shall not,
except for single-family residences, be used in the computation of parking
spaces. Off-street parking is not required in the Central Commercial District;
however, off-street parking is required in all other zoning districts to ensure
on-street parking does not result from normal use of the property. If off-
street parking capacity is exceeded and street parking is generated more often
than six times during a six-month period, this will be deemed to result from
normal use of the property and additional off-street parking shall be required.
      (2)   Existing parking space. Existing off-street parking space provided
for any building or use at the time of the enactment of this chapter shall not
thereafter be reduced unless it exceeds the requirements of this chapter. Any
existing building or use not providing off-street parking space in conformance
with this chapter shall, at the time of any structural alteration of the
building or expansion of the use, provide the required parking.
      (3)   Minimum parking space dimensions. The minimum dimensions of off-
street parking shall be a minimum of ten feet in width by 20 feet in length.
Additional area shall be required in order to provide vehicle maneuvering
space, access and egress, and for purposes of rough computation, an off-street
parking space with ingress/egress and maneuvering space is considered to be 400
square feet.
      (4)   Minimum number of off-street parking spaces. If three or more off-
street parking spaces are required by the table below, the owner shall have
individual spaces marked and so designed, maintained and regulated as to
prevent the need for parking or maneuvering incidental to parking to take place
on any street, walk or public alleyway. The design for all off-street parking
shall be such that any pace may be utilized by one vehicle without having to
move another. The following table sets forth the minimum number of off-street
parking spaces for specific uses. The gross floor area of warehouses, storage
space, employee workshop areas or accessory structures shall not be utilized in
the computation of parking space requirements. Where more than one use occupies
a building, the total of the combined standards shall be required:
Use Minimum Parking Area or Parking Space(s)
Use                                     Minimum Parking Area or Parking Space

      (5)   Minimum setback. Parking areas shall be located no closer than five
feet from any property line.
      (6)   Space arrangement and layout. Off-street parking shall be located
on the same property as the permitted use, unless the Planning Commission
authorizes the use of other properties. Combined uses shall provide parking
equal to the sum of the individual uses. The required parking area for the
permitted use shall not be reduced or encroached upon in any manner; however,
consolidated uses of a parking area by various properties may be granted a
variance of the parking space requirement if the multiple uses served by the
consolidated parking area generate parking demands at non-overlapping times of
a 24-hour day.
      (7)   Off-street parking on adjacent property. If off-street parking
cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the permitted use is
conducted, the Board of Adjustments may permit off-street parking and loading
on adjacent property; provided that such space is within 400 feet of an
entrance to the permitted use. This off-street parking area shall be deemed as
required open space associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter
be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. The Planning Commission or Board
of Zoning Adjustments may require a plat, deed or any other proof necessary to
show that the required loading/unloading space, if located off the premises it
serves, is controlled by and available to the applicant.
   (B)   Off-street loading/unloading requirements.
      (1)   General. All buildings and uses which generate regular trucking/
delivery/transport traffic shall provide sufficient off-street loading/
unloading space on premises such that no unloading/loading activity will be
generated on the required off-street parking spaces or on any street. Areas
which are specified as loading/unloading zones in compliance with city
ordinances may be used to satisfy this requirement. Permitted uses shall
provide off-street loading/unloading areas and adequate ingress/egress. No
building shall be designed, erected, altered, used or occupied unless the
required off-street loading/unloading requirements are satisfied. Off-street
loading/unloading areas shall be located on the same property as the permitted
use and structure it serves and shall be paved.
      (2)   Minimum setback. Loading/unloading areas shall be located no closer
than five feet from any property line.
      (3)   Minimum size of off-street loading/unloading spaces. Loading/
unloading berths shall be a minimum of ten feet in width, 35 feet in length and
15 feet in height.
      (4)   Minimum number of off-street loading/unloading. The following
listing sets forth minimum number of off-street loading/unloading berths:
Gross Floor Area of Permitted Structures/ Minimum Off-Street Loading/Unloading
Buildings (Square Feet)                   Berths
Gross Floor Area of Permitted      Minimum Off-Street Loading/Unloading

Greater than 400,000               1 per additional 100,000 square feet GFA
 
      (5)   Off-street loading/unloading on adjacent property. If off-street
loading/unloading cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the
permitted use is conducted, the Planning Commission or Board of Zoning
Adjustments may permit off-street parking and loading on adjacent property;
provided that such space is within 400 feet of an entrance to the permitted
use. This off-street loading/unloading area shall be deemed as required open
space associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or
encroached upon in any manner. The Board of Zoning Adjustments or Planning
Commission may require a plat, deed or any other proof necessary to show that
the required loading/unloading space, if located off the premises it serves, is
controlled by and available to the applicant.
   (C)   On-street parking and loading/unloading. The on-street parking of
vehicles 20 feet or longer in length on public streets shall be prohibited in a
residential district, except for limited delivery, maintenance, construction or
other loading/unloading purposes.

§ 156.057 CHILD DAY CARE CENTERS.
   (A)   Generally. A child day care center, whether home-based or located in a
separate structure and properly licensed by the state agency presently charged
with regulating childcare facilities in the Commonwealth, may be approved as a
conditional use in Residential (R-l, R-2, R-3) or Commercial Restricted (CR)
Zoning Districts subject to certain exceptions and specific use standards
identified here. In zoning districts where a child day care center is already a
permitted use, it shall be subject to the specific use standards prospectively
from the date of adoption of this chapter.
   (B)   Exceptions. A child day care center does not include public or private
schools or facilities operated in connection with shopping centers or other
principal uses where children are cared for temporarily while parents,
guardians or custodians are occupied on the premises or in the immediate
vicinity. A child day care center does not include the provision of childcare,
nursery, guidance or supervision by religious organizations only while
religious services are being conducted. A child day care center does not
include kindergarten programs operated as a part of a public educational
system.
   (C)   Specific use standards. Child day care centers, nurseries,
kindergartens or any facility or operation providing child care, guidance or
supervision for which a license is required from the state agency presently
having jurisdiction to regulate the provision of child care, with the exception
of religious organizations providing child care, guidance or supervision only
while religious services are being conducted or to kindergarten programs
operated as a part of a public educational system, require compliance with the
following requirements:
      (1)   The lot shall contain a minimum open space area as required by the
Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services or such other agency of the
Commonwealth having authority to regulate facilities providing childcare;
      (2)   A solid wall or adequate security fence not less than six feet high
is maintained along all interior lot lines which separate play areas from
adjacent properties and parking areas. Outdoor play areas shall be contiguous
with the building so children can safely walk from the building to the play
area. Outdoor play area which lies within or adjoins a residential district
shall be buffered by landscaping or a solid privacy fence;
      (3)   The Board of Adjustments, if applicable, may set hours or otherwise
limit outdoor play times for any facility located within a residential district
or adjacent to a residential structure;
      (4)   A letter from the Fire Marshal and the Kentucky Cabinet for
Families and Children, or their successor agency certifying that the use
complies with the requirements of that agency. This documentation must be
supplied to the Planning Commission prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy by the Building Inspector;
      (5)   Adequate and safe on-site parking, loading and unloading areas and
driveways providing for safe ingress and egress with backing into the street
specifically prohibited;
      (6)   If the proposed use will be located within or adjacent to any
residential district, then the structure shall remain or shall be constructed
so that the exterior design and ornamentation is residential in character and
compatible with the immediate neighborhood, so that there is no evidence from
the street that the use is other than residential (except for the sign);
      (7)   In Residential Zones (R-1, R-2 and R-3) child day cares as home
occupations shall be limited to three to six children and shall require a
conditional use permit under §
156.071(C); and
      (8)   All buildings and structures shall conform to the requirements of
the zoning district in which they are located. Signage shall be limited as
outlined by the applicable use category for each zoning district and as
provided in §§
156.145 through
156.159.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 156.058 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   A planned-development project may be allowed in those zoning districts where
it is designated as a permitted use under the zoning district regulations. (A
minimum of three acres is required for a planned-development project). A
planned-development project may depart from literal conformance with individual
lot dimension and area regulations. A planned-development project may be under
single or divided ownership. All planned-development projects shall be subject
to the following regulations.
   (A)   Procedure. When a planned-development project is proposed, the
procedure for subdivision approval as set forth in the subdivision regulations
shall be followed in its entirety even though the ownership of land may not be
divided. A preliminary plat and final plat, both approved by the Planning
Commission shall be required for every planned-development project. The
Planning Commission may establish a schedule of reasonable fees to be charged
for plat review. The project shall be developed according to the approved final
plat. Zoning permits and certificates of occupancy shall be required for each
building according to this chapter.
   (B)   Uses and densities. The uses of premises and development densities in
a planned-development project shall conform with the permitted uses and
densities of the zoning district in which it is located.
   (C)   Standards. In any planned-development project, although it is
permissible to depart from literal conformance with the individual lot
dimension and area regulations, there shall be no diminution of total-
equivalent-lot-area, parking area and loading/unloading area requirement that
would be necessary for the equivalent amount of individual lot development with
one exception; the Planning Commission may allow reductions in these
requirements if the developer can satisfactorily prove that large-scale
development may permit such reductions without destroying the intent of these
regulations.
   (D)   Special conditions. The Planning Commission shall attach reasonable
special conditions to ensure that there shall be no departure from the intent
of this chapter. The planned-development project shall conform with all such
conditions. Because a planned-development project is inherently more complex
than individual-lot development and because each such project must be tailored
to the topography and neighboring uses, the standards for such projects cannot
be inflexible. The Planning Commission shall attach special conditions based on
all of the following standards in addition to imposing the standards for total
area, parking area and loading/unloading area defined in division (C) above.
The Planning Commission may also attach any other reasonable special
conditions.
      (1)   It is desirable that access points to all arterial streets shall be
located no more frequently than one every eighth to quarter mile. The Planning
Commission may approve the platting of temporary access points.
      (2)   Wherever there is an abrupt change in uses, such as, residential to
commercial, it is desirable that a buffer area of open space or protective
planting be placed between them which will protect each use from the
undesirable effects on the other.
      (3)   Parking and other areas used by the public at night shall be
adequately lighted, and private areas shall be adequately protected from such
lighting and any other lighting from public areas. Public streets may also
require protection from excessive glare of lighted areas.

request of the Board of Adjustments to determine if the use of the conditions
in the permit are being met and to determine if the land violates any laws or
regulations.
      (1)   Inspection and report. The Administrative Official shall have the

hearing, the Board of Adjustments may authorize the Administrative Official to
revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause
the termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit
authorizes.
   (I)   Conditional uses as permitted uses. Once the Board of Adjustments has
completed a conditional use permit and all the conditions required are of such
type that they can be completely and permanently satisfied, the Administrative
Official, upon request of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a
determination that the conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts

situations and provided that such relief may be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and
purpose of this chapter. The Board of Adjustments shall deny any request for a
variance arising from circumstances that are the result of a willful violation
of the chapter by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the chapter from

of a specific piece of property, which at the time of the adoption of this
chapter, was a lot of record;

within the purpose of this chapter; or
      (3)   Where it is shown that the land in question cannot be subdivided
and that more open space is created, a lower density can be established,

least seven days and not more than 21 days before the public hearing in
accordance with KRS Chapter 424.
      (2)   Mailed notice. The Board of Adjustments shall send notice of the
required public hearing by first class mail to owners of real property that are
adjacent to the land that is subject to the variance application at least 14
days prior to the public hearing.
      (3)   Posted notice. The Board of Adjustments shall post a notice of the

of Adjustments shall hold at least one public hearing. The Board of Adjustments
may approve, modify or deny any application. The Board of Adjustments may grant
a variance if it concludes that unnecessary hardship would result from the
strict application of this chapter. The Board of Adjustments shall determine
and express in writing, all of the following findings that:
         (a)   The requested variance arises from special circumstances which
do not generally apply to land in the general vicinity or the same zone;
         (b)   The strict application of the provisions of the chapter would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an
unnecessary hardship on the applicant;
         (c)   The circumstances are the result of the applicant taken
subsequent to the adoption of the chapter from which relief is sought; and
         (d)   The requested variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or welfare, will not alter the character of the general
vicinity, will not cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public, and will not
allow unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the chapter.
      (2)   In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustments may attach thereto
such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the
proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable in the furtherance
of the purposes of this chapter.
   (G)   Land use certification recordation. The Board of Adjustments secretary
shall file a land use certificate in the County Court Clerk’s office for all
conditional use permits within 30 days of the date upon which the Board of
Adjustments takes final action to grant the variance. The land use certificate
shall be completed and recorded in conformance with the KRS Chapter 100.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 156.133 ZONING PERMITS.
   The zoning permit ensures that the contemplated use is in accord with those
permitted in that district and that all dimensional and other requirements of
this chapter are met. A zoning permit is not the same as a building permit
although it may be obtained at the same time and from the same person. It shall
be unlawful to commence construction or alteration of any structure until the
Administrative Official has issued a zoning permit authorizing such work except
as specified.
   (A)   Exceptions. No zoning permit shall be required in the following cases:
      (1)   Recurring maintenance work regardless of cost;
      (2)   Installation of required improvements according to an approved
preliminary subdivision plat or planned-development plat;
      (3)   Local public utility distributing and collecting structures such as
pipes and transmission lines, transformers, meters and the like. Large utility
structures such as substations are permitted only as conditional uses;
      (4)   Public streets and all appurtenances necessary for traffic
direction and safety;
      (5)   Private drives, private parking areas and the parking of vehicles
incidental to the principal use on the same premises;
      (6)   Exempt signs as outlined in §§
156.145 through
156.159;
      (7)   Horticulture and landscaping of any premises;
      (8)   Agriculture; or
      (9)   Handicap-accessible ramps which are preempted by state and federal
laws.
   (B)   Fees. The Planning Commission may establish a schedule of reasonable
fees to be charged for the issuance of zoning permits.
   (C)   Zoning permit procedure.
      (1)   Application. The applicant shall submit a plan along with the
application showing the dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the outside
dimensions of all structures to be constructed or altered and all existing
structures, the use of all structures, yard depths and any other information
necessary for determining conformance with the chapter. The Administrative
Official and/or the Board of Zoning Adjustments reserves the right to require
additional information necessary to make said determination, including, but not
limited to, survey drawn to scale, as-built survey, copies of deeds and/or plot
plans. The Water and Sewer Commission’s certificate approving proposed water
and sewage facilities must accompany applications for a zoning permit.
      (2)   Issuance. If the proposed construction or alteration conforms with
all applicable provisions of the chapter and all other applicable ordinances,
regulations and codes, the Administrative Official shall issue a zoning permit
authorizing such construction or alteration. If the proposed construction or
alteration fails to conform, the Administrative Official shall refuse to issue
a zoning permit and shall deliver written notice to the applicant stating the
reason for the refusal. The Administrative Official shall act upon applications
for zoning permits within two weeks from the date of their submission. In
instances where the proposed construction or alteration does not fully conform
to all applicable provisions of the chapter and all other applicable
ordinances, regulations and codes, the Administrative Official at the request
of the applicant and at the Administrative Official’s sole discretion can issue
a zoning permit authorizing partial construction, providing the Administrative
Official follows guidelines previously approved by the Planning Commission for
such action. In addition, the Planning Commission in order to promote and
protect the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the city, may require
issuance of a zoning permit for partial construction in some instances. In both
of the above instances, it is the responsibility of the applicant to conform to
all regulations in order for any zoning permit to remain valid.
      (3)   Duration. A zoning permit shall become void 12 months from the date
of issuance unless substantial progress has been made by that date on the
construction or alteration authorized therein. A zoning permit may be renewed
without fee upon review by the Administrative Official before it becomes void.
The renewal request shall be submitted in writing.
      (4)   Permanent file. The Administrative Official shall keep a permanent
file of all applications with accompanying plans and all permits issued.
   (D)   Floodplains. The Administrative Official may approve a zoning permit
but shall advise the applicant when the site on which the applicant wants to
build is within the 100-year floodplain, as determined by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers. All applicable floodplain regulations and requirements
must be completed. All buildings or structures in a designated floodway or
floodplain which tend to increase flood heights or obstruct the flow of flood
waters shall be regulated by the Planning Commission, and therefore, require
the review and approval of the County Planning Commission.

be limited to a determination of whether the decision being appealed was not
based upon substantial evidence; and arbitrary and capricious. The Board of

of the factors set forth above exists. The Board of Adjustments shall not
substitute its judgment for the judgment of the Administrative Official.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.001 PURPOSE.
   These subdivision regulations are designed to encourage the development of
residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions according to recognized
standards which provide for sound, efficient and economical development; to
provide for safe, convenient and efficient traffic circulation; to coordinate
land development to ensure that future growth will be orderly and conducive to
the provision of minimum outlay of public and private expenditures in providing
services to developing areas; to minimize fire hazards; to provide adequate
light and air in inhabitable structures; and to provide sound and efficient
guidelines for the overall development of the area where these subdivision
regulations are in force.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.002 SHORT TITLE.
   The full title of these subdivision regulations shall be “The Land
Subdivision Regulations of Springfield, Kentucky.” The short title of these
regulations shall be known, and may be cited, as the “subdivision regulations”
or “this chapter.”
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.003 AUTHORITY AND ADMINISTRATION.
   These regulations are adopted by the City Planning Commission and the City
Council under the authority granted by the KRS Chapter 100. The regulations
shall be administered by the City Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.004 AREA OF JURISDICTION.
   The City Planning Commission, by virtue of adoption of these regulations,
shall have jurisdiction and control over the subdivision of all land within the
corporate limits of the city and within the unincorporated area adjacent to the
city for a distance of one mile from the corporate boundary.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
MAJOR AND MINOR CLASSES OF SUBDIVISIONS
§ 157.015 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish different classes of
land subdivisions on the basis of their importance to the overall development
of the community.
   (B)   The classification of land subdivisions will expedite the processing
of certain classes of subdivisions and permit the establishment of requirements
for subdivision plan preparation and approval which may vary for the different
classes of subdivisions.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.016 PROCESSING CLASSES FOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, KRS Chapter 100 defines a SUBDIVISION
as the division of a parcel of land into two or more lots or parcels for the
purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, lease or building development,
or if a new street is involved, any division of a parcel of land; provided,
that a division of land for agricultural purposes into lots or parcels of five
acres or more and not involving a new street shall not be deemed a SUBDIVISION.
The term includes a re-subdivision and, when appropriate to the context, shall
relate to the process of subdivision or to the land subdivided.
   (B)   (1)   The state statutes further provide that no land shall be
subdivided, transferred or sold, or agreed to be sold, until after a plat of
such land is prepared and approved in conformance with the requirements
established by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Metes and bounds descriptions shall not be used for the above
purposes to replace the required platting procedures, and no plat shall be
accepted for recording by the County Clerk until it has been approved in
writing by the Planning Commission.
   (C)   In order to proceed towards establishing such requirements,
subdivisions shall be classified as follows.
      (1)   Major subdivision. Subdivisions of land which are generally of
major significance to the future development of the community, and shall
include all subdivisions which do not conform to the definitions established
for minor subdivisions. Generally, major subdivisions would be those which
create five or more lots for sale or building development for the establishment
of residential, commercial or industrial activities. If the Commission
determines that a minor subdivision is of significant importance to the
development of an area, the subdivision may be treated as a major subdivision.
      (2)   Minor subdivision. Subdivisions of land which are generally of
secondary planning significance to the community’s future development. Such
minor subdivisions are described below, and shall conform to the requirements
established in this subchapter.
      (3)   Consolidation of minor subdivision. Subdivisions characterized by
the following.
         (a)   Adjoining properties. The subdivision shall be solely for the
purpose of transferring a portion of a parcel or tract of land to an adjoining
property with which it is to be consolidated. Such adjoining property shall
have a common boundary with the parcel of land intended for transfer.
         (b)   Conformance to community plans. The subdivision shall be in
conformance with community development plans, implementation devices and other
applicable regulations or ordinances, including, among other considerations,
any necessary dedication for adequate street rights-of-way.
      (4)   Building site minor subdivision. Subdivisions characterized by the
following.
         (a)   Number of divisions. There shall be a maximum of five lots in a
building site minor subdivision.
         (b)   Access.
            1.   All lots shall abut for at least 50 feet upon a street
dedicated for public use. Lots may abut upon private access easement when all
of the following conditions are met:
               a.   The private street will serve no more than four lots;
               b.   The minimum width of access easement shall be 30 feet;
               c.   The length of private street shall not exceed 150 feet;
               d.   The minimum pavement width shall be 16 feet;
               e.   The slope of the street shall not exceed 12%;
               f.   All setbacks established for the zone in which the property
is located shall be observed from the easement line;
               g.   All utilities must agree to serve any lots fronting on a
private street;
               h.   The private street shall not adversely impact neighboring
properties; and
               i.   A deed of restrictions outlining maintenance
responsibilities for the private street shall be filed with the plat.
            2.   If a new street dedicated to the public is involved, the
subdivision shall be considered a major subdivision. If a new private street is
involved, the subdivision shall be considered a minor subdivision.
         (c)   Conformance to community plans. The subdivision shall be in
conformance with community development plans, implementation devices and other
applicable regulations or ordinances, including, among other considerations,
any necessary dedication for adequate street rights-of-way.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.017 ADMINISTRATIVELY APPROVABLE PLATS.
   If all of the following apply, the respective plat may be approved for
recording by the Zoning Enforcement Officer:
   (A)   The plat reflects a change in lot lines that do not increase the
number of lots/tracts or where the division of property results in only one
additional lot and there has been no more than one such division in the prior
five years, the minor subdivision may be approved by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer for recording;
   (B)   The use of the property is to remain the same or is a use allowed in
the current zoning classification for the property; and
   (C)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may at his or her sole discretion refer
any plat, subject to approval under this section, to the Planning Commission
for its approval.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
MINOR SUBDIVISION PLATS
§ 157.030 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish special requirements to
expedite the preparation and processing of minor subdivision plats.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.031 PROCEDURE.
   Where a proposed subdivision can be classified as a minor subdivision
according to §§
157.015 through
157.017, the procedure for submission of a preliminary plat for approval may be
waived by the Planning Commission after the advisory meeting. However, the
procedure for approval of the final plat remains the same.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
MAJOR SUBDIVISION PLATS
§ 157.045 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish the procedure which shall be
followed by the developer and the Planning Commission in preparing, reviewing
and approving all subdivision plans. (Except that minor subdivisions may skip
the preliminary plat phase with approval of the Planning Commission.)
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.046 PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.
   The developer should arrange a conference with the Planning Commission
before a preliminary plat is submitted. The purpose of the conference is to
afford the developer an opportunity to avail himself or herself the assistance
of the Commission and its staff before he or she prepares a preliminary plan
and makes formal application for its approval. This procedure will reduce the
number of unnecessary and costly changes which are often required when a plat
is submitted for review before the Commission has had an opportunity to review
it.
   (A)   Sketch plan. The developer should have a rough sketch plan prepared
before the pre-application conference to show the boundaries of the tract,
location and sidewalks, the proposed street and lot arrangement and other
pertinent information.
   (B)   Office visit. The developer should then visit the Commission’s office
and informally discuss his or her ideas with the Commission or its staff. This
informal discussion shall not constitute a formal application and will be
considered confidential. The developer should also consult with the utility
companies and other local agencies at this time.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.047 PRELIMINARY PLAT PROCEDURE.
   All subdivision plats shall receive their first official consideration as
preliminary plats. No developer shall proceed with any construction work,
including grading, before a plat has been given preliminary approval. The
following procedures shall be required during the preliminary plat procedure.
   (A)   Design plans. The developer shall have a registered surveyor,
registered engineer, landscape architect, architect or community planner
(provided that engineering data is supplied by a registered engineer, or
surveyor for landscape architects, and community planners) prepare the
preliminary plat in conformance with the format, design and improvement
requirements of these regulations. Utility companies and other concerned city
and county agencies should be consulted before the preliminary plat is
prepared.
   (B)   Formal application and submission.
      (1)   A completed application secured from the Commission’s office and
six 11" x 17" copies of the preliminary plat folded to 8-1/2" x 11" submitted
to the Planning Commission shall constitute an application for formal action on
the preliminary plat. For maximum assurance that a plat will receive Commission
consideration at a certain meeting, the plats should be submitted at least 20
days before such meeting.
      (2)   A letter addressing the availability of utilities shall be filed
with the preliminary plat.
   (C)   Distribution and review of plats. The Commission shall make copies of
the preliminary plats available to all concerned city and county agencies. The
Commission will consider all comments from these agencies before making
recommendations on the plats.
   (D)   Notification of action. After Commission action, two copies of the
plat will be marked in conformance with the Commission’s actions and the
developer shall be notified of the Commission’s action and requested to pick up
his or her plat.
      (1)   Approval.
         (a)   The developer is authorized to proceed with physical
improvements in the proposed subdivision and to proceed with the preparation of
the final plats. Lots shall not be sold until a final plat has been approved.
         (b)   Preliminary approval grants a developer a maximum time limit of
12 months during which he or she shall submit a final plat, unless a time
extension is granted by the Commission. During this 12-month period, no changes
shall be made unless they are for the purpose of correcting obvious errors or
omissions.
      (2)   Conditional approval. The developer may proceed as outlined in
division (E) above but only after corrected preliminary plats have been
submitted to the Commission’s Chairperson.
      (3)   Postponement. Action is delayed for definite reasons which shall be
noted by the Commission.
      (4)   Disapproval. The denial of approval for the submitted plat. Before
further action can occur, the developer must revise his or her plat to conform
to the Commission’s requirements.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.048 FINAL PLAT PROCEDURE.
   All subdivision plats shall receive their second and last consideration as
final plats. No developer shall sell or agree to sell any lot until after a
final plat has been approved. The following procedure shall be required for all
final plats.
   (A)   Design plans. The developer shall have a registered surveyor or
engineer prepare a final plat in conformance with the format, design and
improvement requirements of these regulations. The final plat is a legal record
of the subdivision as surveyed in the field and must agree with the approved
preliminary plan, except that final plans covering a portion of the approved
preliminary plat may be submitted.
   (B)   Time lapse. Unless a time extension has been requested by the
developer and granted by the Commission, all final plats shall be submitted
within 12 months of the approval date of the preliminary plat. If a time period
in excess of 12 months elapses, the preliminary plat must be re-submitted and
approved before final plat approval can be considered.
   (C)   Material to be submitted. The following final plat materials must be
submitted by the developer. For maximum assurance that a plat will be
considered at a certain Commission meeting for the plat, materials should be
submitted at least ten days prior to such meeting.
      (1)   Subdivision plats. Six prints of the plat showing the manner in
which the land is proposed to be subdivided and legally recorded shall be
presented to the Commission. The plats shall be in conformance with
specifications outlined in §
156.156.
      (2)   Bond for physical improvements. The Commission shall have no
obligation to allow developers to post surety bonds in lieu of completed
physical improvements, but it may permit said bonds if it so desires. When
bonds are permitted, the developer shall submit cost estimates to the
Commission to cover the full cost of all physical improvements. The developer
shall then post a surety bond with the Commission, running to the Planning
Commission for and on behalf of the city. A time period of one year will be
allowed for construction of improvements.
      (3)   Utility approval. A copy of a letter approving the location and
size of all easements and rights-of-way must be obtained from the following
utilities: the City Water and Sewer Commission, electric utility companies, gas
utility companies, telephone utility companies, internet utility companies and
cable television utility companies.
   (D)   Distribution and review of plats. The Commission shall make copies of
the final plat available to all concerned city and county agencies. The
Commission will consider all comments from these agencies before making
recommendations on the plats.
   (E)   Notification of action. After Commission action, two copies of the
plat will be marked in conformance with the Commission’s action and the
developer shall be notified of the Commission’s action and requested to pick up
his or her plat.
      (1)   Approval. The final plat has been signed by the Chairperson of the
Commission and may be recorded. After recording, the developer may sell or
agree to sell lots by reference to the approved and recorded final plat.
Commission approval shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance
by the city or county of the dedication of any street or other proposed space
offered for dedication, since such acceptance is the prerogative of the city
and county legislative bodies.
      (2)   Conditional approval. The developer may proceed as outlined in
division (E)(1) above but only after he or she has met the conditions attached
to the approval.
      (3)   Postponement. The Commission has deferred action until some future
Commission meeting in order that certain clarification can be made in regard to
the plat.
      (4)   Disapproval. Complete denial of the final plat. To request review
and action, the developer must revise the plat to conform to Commission
requirements and re-submit a new set of final plats.
   (F)   Recording final plat. Within 90 days of the Commission’s approval,
unless a time extension has been granted by the Commission previous to the
expiration date, a certified copy of the final plat shall be filed for
recording in the County Clerk’s office. The Commission’s action becomes null
and void if this requirement is not met. The Commission’s action is also voided
if the certified plat is altered in any manner (except for Commission
requirements) between the date of Commission approval and recording.

§ 157.078 STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Introduction. The purpose of this section is to establish the minimum
standards required for the design and construction of public roadways in the
city. This section is intended to assist a private developer in the design and
construction of subdivision roadways which will be dedicated (once properly
constructed) to the city for public use, repair and maintenance.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      CITY. The local government agency which shall be responsible for all
current and future repair and maintenance of existing and newly developed city
roadways.
      CITY ENGINEER. The engineer employed by the city. The CITY ENGINEER shall
be responsible for the design review and construction review of any public
roadway owned and maintained by the city. The CITY ENGINEER’S Office is located
at Springfield City Hall, 127 West Main Street, Springfield, KY 40069 and has
phone number (859)336-5440.
      PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT. The Public Works Superintendent or other

(859)336-5440.
      STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. The Kentucky Standard Specifications for Road
and Bridge Construction commonly used for all new, repair and maintenance work
associated with state highways and bridges in the state. The edition of this
book to be utilized shall be that edition which is in effect when the design/
construction plans for a new proposed city roadway has been submitted to the
city for approval. When the term “Engineer” or phrase “as approved by the
Engineer” is used in the STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS, it shall be construed to mean
the City Engineer. The STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS shall be the minimum standard
utilized for construction and inspection of the city public roadways. Any
developer who intends to utilize different specifications than the STANDARD
SPECIFICATIONS shall specifically identify the difference in the construction
plans.
   (C)   Procedures.
      (1)   All developers/contractors who wish to construct a new road or
extend an existing road, and of which that developer intends to dedicate
ownership of that road to the city once constructed, shall accomplish the
following:
         (a)   Comply with all zoning regulations required by the city;
         (b)   Comply with this chapter developed by the Planning Commission;
         (c)   Submit preliminary construction plans (with or after the
preliminary plat submittal) to the City Engineer for review. No construction of
a proposed public roadway shall begin until the City Engineer has reviewed the
construction plan;
         (d)   Review the site with the City Engineer. Be prepared to discuss
locations of borrow material, sample locations and number of proctors (to be
used for soil densities), cross drain culverts, easements and rights-of-way;
         (e)   Revise preliminary construction plans to comply with the City
Engineer’s comments and concerns. Re-submit final construction plans for final
approval by the City Engineer; and
         (f)   Once the final construction plans have been approved by the City
Engineer, construction may begin; provided the preliminary plat and other
requirements of the Planning Commission have been complied with.
      (2)   Any construction activities which begin prior to construction plan
review and approval shall be at the owner’s own risk.
   (D)   Roadway design and construction.
      (1)   Construction plans.
         (a)   All newly developed roadways, either in subdivisions or
extensions of existing roads, which are intended to be dedicated to the city at
a later date, shall be required to have construction plans. These construction
plans shall be submitted to, reviewed by and approved by the City Engineer
prior to construction.
         (b)   To assure proper review and approval of the construction plans
prior to final plat approval, the construction plans shall be submitted to the
City Engineer a minimum of 20 working days prior to the Planning and Zoning
subdivision plat review committee meeting.
         (c)   These plans shall be in sufficient detail to properly inform the
City Engineer of all fills, cuts, ditches, culverts, bridges, preliminary lot
layout and any other information necessary which may be required for a city-
owned roadway. The plans shall comply with the following:
            1.   Roads shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
this document and this chapter; and
            2.   The minimum requirements for construction plans shall be:
               a.   Plan, profile, curve data, etc. of the roadway showing
roadway cuts, fills, alignment, and road grades;
               b.   Existing contour lines at a minimum of five feet (or closer
for hilly sites). Contour lines shall be of sufficient detail to depict all
hills, creeks, sink holes, ponds and other features which might impact roadway
construction;
               c.   Typical roadway cross-sections showing pavement structure,
width and side drainage ditches;
               d.   Roadway location with respect to subdivision lot layouts,
adjacent property owners, connection roads (names), new phases (proposed) and
the like;
               e.   Cross drain culverts, including sizes, lengths, locations
and materials (including headwalls). Culverts shall be sized for a 25-year
storm event and certified by a professional engineer. Show all retention
structures if required;
               f.   Roadway side ditches and proposed driveway culverts;
               g.   Roadway right-of-way to be dedicated to the city;
               h.   Utility easements with proposed utilities;
               i.   Construction or maintenance easements if needed;
               j.   If septic tanks/lateral fields are to be used for sewage
disposal, provide a copy of the preliminary on-site evaluation provided by the
County Health Department;
               k.   All plans shall be prepared, sealed, and signed by a
licensed professional engineer of the state who routinely prepares such design
assuring that all features such as culverts, bridges and any other structures
are properly designed to carry intended loads; and
               l.   All variances to the above requirements shall be
specifically noted or requested.
      (2)   Specifications. All materials and procedures utilized in the design
and construction of a new city roadway shall comply with the appropriate
section in the Standard Specifications such as concrete, asphalt, dense graded
aggregate, pipe materials and the like. Typical details such as culvert
headwalls shall be as specified in the Standard Drawings Manual developed by
the Kentucky Department of Highways. Reference to this Manual shall be made
when designing such structures. Any variance to this Manual shall be noted.
      (3)   Roadway construction (to subgrade).
         (a)   All roadway fills and cuts shall be shown on the plans. In areas
that require embankments to be constructed, the developer shall understand they
will be required to comply with Section 206 Embankment of the Standard
Specifications. Soil proctors (target densities) may be required as determined
in the construction plan review. This will depend on the soil type at the
proposed development site. Proctors will involve soil samples to be collected
and sent off to an acceptable laboratory with target densities (with acceptable
moisture contents) developed for the soil to be used in the embankment
construction. Field densities will be routinely checked by using nuclear
density meters operated by an approved construction inspection company. These
field densities will be the responsibility of the developer/contractor when
required by the City Engineer.
         (b)   Density reports shall be routinely provided to the City Engineer
during construction. Embankment materials which fail the field density check
will be required to be excavated, refilled, and compacted with suitable
material in accordance with the Standard Specifications.
         (c)   The minimum in place dry density of subgrade soils utilized for
subgrade construction shall be as described in Section 205 of the Standard
Specifications. Specifically, all subgrade construction shall obtain 95% of the
maximum density (based on the proctor) or 98 pounds per cubic foot (whichever
is greater).
         (d)   Most soils within the city and county have a California Bearing
Ratio (CBR) less than six. Subgrade stabilization is recommended for any soil
with a CBR less than seven.
         (e)   As a means to provide a barrier between the subgrade and
pavement base materials, geotextile fabrics should be used in accordance with
the Standard Specifications in saturated foundation areas and in embankment
benching areas or as required by the City Engineer.
         (f)   Subgrade drainage systems shall be installed so as to drain any
subsurface water from the pavement structure. Either porous aggregate
underdrains or perforated and non-perforated pipe underdrains shall be used in
accordance with the Standard Specifications. Underdrain systems shall be
installed at a minimum of 100 feet center-to-center spacing along the degrees
of the roadway and may be required as directed by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Roadway construction (pavement structure).
         (a)   Generally.
            1.   City streets shall be designed according to the following
minimum pavement sections for the specified street classification. Designs are
based on soils with a CBR of three or less and a design life of 15 years.
Alternate pavement designs may be submitted to the Office of the City Engineer
for approval by a licensed Engineer with an accompanying geotechnical report.
Alternate designs shall be in accordance with the current edition of KYTC’s
Pavement Design Guide and Standard Specifications.

when practical.
      (5)   Slopes, ditches and culverts.
         (a)   Slopes. The grades of the proposed roadway shall be specifically
shown on the profile sheet. Roadway side slopes (embankment fill areas,
including over culverts) shall be a maximum (steepest) of a three horizontal to
one vertical - 3H:1V.
         (b)   Ditches.
            1.   Parallel roadway ditches shall typically be a “V” type ditch
with a 3H:1V side slope designed to a depth to properly channel surface
drainage away from the pavement structure. Ditches shall be a minimum of six
inches below the bottom of the pavement stone base layer so as to allow the
subgrade drainage system to function properly. Typical ditches shall be shown
on the plan and profile sheets. When the roadway grade is greater than 5%, side

the plans. All underground utilities which cross the roadway (i.e., electric
lines) shall be specifically shown on the construction plans. All utilities
which are to be installed in the city’s right-of- way shall have utility
identification tape installed during backfill of the utility trench. This
identification tape shall be placed at approximately 18 inches above the
utility. All utilities which are installed within the pavement structure area
shall be property backfilled and compacted in accordance with Section 603
Foundation Preparation and Backfill of the Standard Specifications.
      (8)   Curb and gutters/sidewalks.
         (a)   Curb, gutters and sidewalks shall be installed when required by
this chapter. The minimum sizes/configuration for the curb/gutters and
sidewalks are shown in Appendix B and Appendix C. Any variance from this detail
shall be identified in the construction plans.
         (b)   Adequate surface drain structures (i.e., curb box inlets with
clean out manholes) shall be installed along the curb and gutters (at all low
points in roadways or at sufficient intervals along relatively flat roadways as
designed by the Engineer) to allow surface water to drain off from the pavement
structure. Catch basin clean out manhole spacing shall not exceed 150 feet.
         (c)   The Design Engineer shall take into account any subsurface
drainage problems that could result from curb/gutter installation due to the
site’s soil/clay material and/or terrain. The requirement for subsurface
drainage is a designer decision.
      (9)   Street lighting. Street lighting shall be installed to meet city
requirements.
      (10)   Street signs. A list of the streets’ names shall be provided to
the city for a particular development. It shall be the responsibility of the

ADMINISTRATION
§ 157.095 VARIANCES.
   (A)   These land subdivision regulations are adopted as minimum
requirements, and all developers should consider developing their subdivisions
at higher standards. Thus, the developer is encouraged to go beyond the
requirements of these regulations, and the Planning Commission may require
standards above the minimum contained herein whenever it feels that public
health, safety or welfare purposes justify such increases.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may also reduce or otherwise vary the
requirements of these regulations whenever it encounters the situations
described below. In granting such variances, the Commission may attach and
require whatever conditions it feels are necessary to secure the basic
objectives of the regulations.
      (1)   Exceptional conditions. When the Commission finds that strict
application of these regulations would result in extreme practical difficulties
because of exceptional and unique topographic or other physical conditions, the
Commission may modify these regulations to the extent necessary to provide
relief for the undue hardship; provided, however, that such relieve may be
granted without detriment to the public welfare and without substantially
impairing the intent and purpose of these regulations. In granting such
variances or modifications, the Planning Commission may require such conditions
as will substantially secure the objectives of the standards or requirements so
varied or modified. Financial disadvantage to the property owner is no proof of
hardship within the purpose of these regulations.
      (2)    Design innovation and large scale development. These regulations
may be modified by the Planning Commission in the case of plans for cluster
development, planned unit development or other design innovations which, in the
Commission’s opinion, achieve the basic objectives of these regulations. The
Commission may require such conditions as it deems necessary to secure the
objectives of these regulations.
(Ord. 2024-004, passed 12-23-2024)
§ 157.096 AMENDMENTS TO THIS CHAPTER.
   The Commission may revise, modify or amend these regulations by appropriate
action taken at a regularly scheduled meeting after the required notice and
public hearing as specified in KRS Chapter 160.

subdivision, or his or her agent, shall transfer or sell or agree to sell any
lot or parcel of land located within a subdivision by reference to, or by
exhibition, or by any other use of a plat of such subdivision, before such plat
has received final approval of the Planning Commission and been recorded by the
County Clerk. Any such instrument of transfer, sale or contract shall be void
and shall not be subject to be recorded.
   (C)   Metes and bounds descriptions. The description of lots or parcels by
metes and bounds in any contract or instrument of transfer or other document
used in the process of selling or transferring same shall not exempt the person
attempting to transfer from penalties provided or deprive the purchaser of any
right or remedies he or she may otherwise have.
   (D)   No recording before approval. No plat of a subdivision of land shall
be recorded by the County Clerk until the plat has been approved by the
Commission and the approval entered thereon in writing by the Chairperson of
