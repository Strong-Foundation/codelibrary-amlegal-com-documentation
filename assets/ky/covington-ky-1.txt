contained in §
110.01 of this code of ordinances shall apply.
      (2)   Business regulatory license required for non-resident businesses,
flea markets and contracting services.
         (a)   A business regulatory license shall be required of any business
entity located or operating outside the city, if the business entity engages in
any type of business activity in the city or solicits and accepts business from
customers within the city. The agent(s) of non-resident proprietor(s) shall be
responsible for obtaining a business regulatory license required by this
section and shall be liable for carrying on a business without a business
regulatory license in the same manner as if they were proprietor(s) of a
business located within the city. Consistent with the definition in §
110.01, the term “business license” may be used interchangeably with “business
regulatory license” for purpose of convenience, and both terms shall have the
same meaning and effect.
         (b)   Each operator of a flea market shall secure a business
regulatory license under this section. Any business entity renting a booth
space in a flea market shall also secure a separate business regulatory
license.
         (c)   Any business entity performing general contracting or sub-
contracting services who satisfies the criteria as an independent contractor,
as set forth in Official Treasury Regulation 31.3401(c)-1, may obtain a

or less;
            4.   The contractor’s business is not located in the city; and
            5.   Any business regulatory license issued under these conditions
will only be valid for three days. If the work performed lasts longer than
three days or if the contractor receives additional work in the city during the
same fiscal year, he or she shall obtain a standard business regulatory license
and shall be allowed to deduct the processing fee of the temporary business
regulatory license from the processing fee for the standard business regulatory
license.
      (3)   Business regulatory license applications.
         (a)   Every person required to procure a business regulatory license
under the provisions of this section or under §
110.02 of this code of ordinances, and pursuant to KRS 82.082 shall submit an
application for the license, in writing, to the Finance Director or his or her
representative on forms provided by the city. The applicant shall identify the
kind of business, profession, occupation, trade, vocation, calling or activity
engaged in or services rendered and provide all other information required on
the application. Failure to fully complete the application shall be grounds for
not issuing a business regulatory license to the applicant. Every entity

         (b)   Any business regulatory license issued will be valid only for
those activities listed on the application form. Any expansion of the business

business regulatory license has been granted, revocation thereof upon discovery
of these facts.
         (c)   If the business is located in the city, the application shall be
approved by the city’s Fire Inspector and the Code Enforcement Department

for that location may be revoked pursuant to the procedures established in
division (A)(7) below.

representative that a business is being operated in violation of this section,

operations shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the business
or its agent and shall state the conditions under which the business may be
resumed. Any person who continues doing business or who alters, defaces or
removes the stop business operations notice shall be liable for a Class A
misdemeanor.
      (4)   Business regulatory license certificates.
         (a)   Upon approval of the application, the Finance Department shall
issue business regulatory license certificate (“the certificate”) to the
applicant. The certificate shall show the period for which business regulatory
license is issued, the name of the person to whom it is issued and the address
or location of the place of business for which the license is being issued.
         (b)   If a business entity moves its place of business, this shall
require submission of a new application with all appropriate departmental
approvals. If a business entity has more than one place of business, a business
regulatory license certificate shall be issued for each place of business. Each
business entity shall display the business regulatory license certificate in a
conspicuous place in each place of business.
      (5)   Administration.
         (a)   This section shall be administered by the Finance Director or
his or her duly designated representative, under the direction of the City
Manager.
         (b)   The Finance Director, with the approval of the City Manager,

section.
         (c)   The Finance Director, under the direction of the City Manager,
will coordinate with Code Enforcement Services to appoint and supervise Code
Enforcement Officers charged with enforcing compliance with this section.
         (d)   The denial of any initial or renewal application for any
business regulatory license shall be set forth in writing, with the reasons
stated therein, and provided to the applicant.
         (e)   An appeal of such adverse decision to the city’s Board of
Commissioners shall be filed with the City Clerk within 30 days thereof, or the
decision shall become final. The Board of Commissioners shall conduct a hearing
on the appeal at any regular or special call meeting within 30 days from the
date the appeal is filed with the City Clerk. Notice of the hearing shall be
provided to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, and if
the certified mail is returned, then by regular mail. The applicant may be
represented by counsel and shall be entitled to call witnesses on his or her
behalf.
         (f)   The decision of the Board of Commissioners shall be reduced to
writing and provided to the applicant within seven days of the hearing. In the
event the Board of Commissioners upholds the denial, the applicant must appeal
the adverse decision to the County District Court within 30 days of the date of
the written decision or the decision shall become final.
      (6)   Penalties, citation for failure to obtain business regulatory
license.
         (a)   Any business entity or person that violates any provision of
this section shall be subject to a civil fine of not less than $100 per
violation, but not more than $500 per violation.
         (b)   Code Enforcement Officers may issue on-site citations to any
business entity that is unable to produce its business regulatory license
certificate upon request, whether the business is being conducted in a
permanent location or elsewhere in the city (“a correction citation”).
         (c)   A correction citation shall provide the following information:
            1.   The date and time of issuance;

            6.   A correction order allowing the business to obtain a license

or fails to contest the citation, and the maximum civil fine that may be
imposed if the person elects to contest the citation;
            8.   The procedure for paying the civil fine or contesting the
citation; and
            9.   A statement explaining that if the person fails to pay the
civil fine set forth in the citation or contest the citation, the right to a
hearing shall be waived and the Code Enforcement Board shall enter a final
order confirming that a violation was committed and imposing the civil fine
stated in the citation.
         (d)   Any person obtaining a business regulatory license certificate
pursuant to a correction citation above shall provide a copy of the citation to
the Finance Department when obtaining this certificate. If a business
regulatory license certificate is obtained within ten days of the citation
issuance, the Finance Department will forward a copy of the citation and
business regulatory license certificate to the Code Enforcement Department,
which will cause the citation to be dismissed and/or stop-work order to be
lifted.
         (e)   Independent contractors who have been cited under this section
shall only be eligible to receive permanent (as opposed to temporary) business
regulatory licenses.
         (f)   Independent contractors who have been cited more than once and
fail to comply with this section shall be subject to a suit for injunction.
      (7)   Revocation or suspension of business regulatory license.
         (a)   Any business regulatory license issued under this section may,
with notice to the holder thereof and a hearing as hereinafter provided for, be
revoked or suspended by the Board of Commissioners if:
            1.   Within 12 months prior to the date on which charges are filed,
the holder of the business regulatory license, or his, her or its agent,
servant or employee, has been convicted of any action or activity occurring at
the business premises covered by the business regulatory license of any
violation of city or county ordinances involving gambling, prostitution, drugs
or disorderly conduct or of any state or federal criminal or penal statute
involving these same crimes;
            2.   A condition is allowed to exist at the business premises that
creates a public nuisance;
            3.   The business regulatory license holder, its agents, servants
or employees, suffer or permit any disorderly conduct at the business premises
that disturbs the good order of the community and/or at the premises; or
            4.   The holder of the business regulatory license misrepresents in
its application any material facts as to the kind of business operating or to
be operated at the premises.
         (b)   Business regulatory licenses may be suspended for violation of §
32.049(C)(1)(b) of this code of ordinances.
         (c)   Suspension and revocation procedure.
            1.   When the City Manager has probable cause to believe that a
business regulatory license should be revoked for any of the causes enumerated
herein, it shall be his or her duty to prepare charges against the holder of
the business regulatory license by filing a statement of the charges against
the holder of the license with the City Clerk. The charges shall be in writing
and each charge shall be clearly set out. Within three days after the filing of
the charges with the Board of Commissioners, a notice of the filing of the
charges and of the time of the hearing thereof shall be mailed by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the business regulatory license holder at
the address shown on the business regulatory license and a hearing before the
Board of Commissioners shall be held within 14 days after the filing of the
charges with the Board.
            2.   At the hearing, the introduction of any judgment of conviction
in any court of competent jurisdiction shall be conclusive evidence that a
violation occurred. The existence of any prior judgment of conviction for the
same or similar offense, under the same ownership/ management as those being
asserted as the basis for the current hearing, shall be considered as actual or
constructive knowledge of the existence of the engagement in the illegal
conduct on the premises covered by the business regulatory license. The
business regulatory license holder shall be permitted to present evidence in
defense of the charges and shall be given the opportunity to refute that the
business regulatory license holder knew or should have known of the existence
of the illegal conduct that led to a conviction on the part of the business
regulatory license holder or any agent, servant or employee thereof.
            3.   The action and decision of the Board of Commissioners on the
charges shall be reduced to writing and kept on file in the City Clerk’s
office.
            4.   Upon a finding that the business regulatory license holder
knew or should have known of the existence of the illegal or improper conduct,
the City Commissioners shall consider the severity and frequency of offenses to
determine whether a period of suspension or a revocation is appropriate. All
business activity at the location shall cease immediately for the period of
suspension or revocation.
      (8)   Revocations affecting renewals or transfers.
         (a)   No transfer of an existing business regulatory license or
issuance of any new business regulatory license shall be permitted so long as
charges against the business and/or the business regulatory license holder are
pending for a suspension or revocation hearing before the Board of
Commissioners pursuant to this section.
         (b)   In the event a business regulatory license is surrendered by the
business regulatory license holder pending charges against the license holder
and prior to any revocation hearing or is revoked or suspended after a hearing,
no new business regulatory license certificate for the business premises for
which the original business regulatory license was granted shall issue to any
person when, in the discretion of the Financial Director, the procurement of a
business regulatory license certificate is attempted for the sole purpose of
allowing the previously surrendered, revoked or suspended business regulatory
license holder, or the holder of a business regulatory license surrendered in
lieu of revocation, to operate the same or substantially similar business under
a new business regulatory license and merely in the name of another person,
constituting a “sham” application.
      (9)   Voluntary surrender. Should any business regulatory license holder
herein voluntarily surrender any existing business regulatory license during
the term of its issuance and prior to expiration thereof, the business
regulatory license shall automatically be deemed as revoked, null and void and
shall only be reissued upon submission of a new application and qualification
for the same.
      (10)   Expiration date. Unless an earlier expiration date is provided
therein, all business regulatory licenses shall expire at midnight on the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the end of the fiscal year of the
licensee.
   (B)   Other licenses.
      (1)   The city may refuse to issue other licenses or permits issued
pursuant to this code or may suspend or revoke such licenses or permits after
notice and hearing for any of the following causes:
         (a)   Any fraud, misrepresentation or false statements contained in
the application for permit or license;
         (b)   Conviction of the applicant, licensee or permittee of any crime
or misdemeanor or a violation of any act of the city, the state or of any law
of the United States having a reasonable relationship to the purpose and scope
of the permit or license; and/or
         (c)   Conducting the activity, or making use of an item, for which the
license is issued in an unlawful manner or in such a manner as to constitute a
breach of the peace or to constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals or
general welfare of the public.
      (2)   (a)   Notice of hearing for the suspension or revocation of a
license or permit shall be in writing given by the Clerk, setting forth
specially the grounds of the complaint and the time and the place of the
hearing.
         (b)   Service of such notice shall be made by either personal service
or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the applicant, licensee or
permittee at the last known address, at least five days prior to the date set
for the hearing.
      (3)   In case of refusal to issue a permit or license or the suspension
or revocation of a license or permit as herein provided, no portion of the
application, license or permit fee shall be returned to the applicant, licensee
or permittee unless otherwise provided in this code or any ordinance of the
city.
      (4)   The order of the Mayor, Board of Commissioners or such other
authorized official, department, board or agency, where applicable, shall be
the final municipal action for the purpose of judicial review.
      (5)   No person holding a license suspended or revoked under this section
shall be permitted to effect a transfer requiring the issuance of another such
license to any person during the periods of any proceeding against the license
holder for a violation of any law, statute or municipal ordinance, which may
result in the suspension or revocation of the license, or during any period of
suspension or revocation.

Chief or Fire Chief has reason to believe that a condition exists which poses
an immediate threat to life, health or safety. Such procedure shall take place
only where the time required to apply for and secure the issuance of a warrant
would render ineffective the immediate action necessary to abate the condition.
   (D)   Where the Police Chief or Fire Chief or his or her designee is refused
entry or access or is otherwise impeded or prevented by the owner, occupant or
operator from conducting an inspection of the premises, such person shall be in

warrant permitting access to the inspection of that part of the premises on

   (A)   The Board of Commissioners, as the combined legislative and executive
authority of the city pursuant to KRS 83A.150, to enhance communications
between it and the city’s Administration Department, in order to increase
government efficiency and to better prepare for the transition to the
Mayor–Council form of government, delegates to the Mayor the necessary
authority to inquire into the conduct of duties and actions performed by the
City Manager between meetings of the Board of Commissioners. The authority
shall be exercised at the discretion of the Mayor and is subject to
ratification by the Board of Commissioners where appropriate. Such delegation
of authority in no way creates regular administrative duties for the Mayor.
   (B)   The Mayor shall be recognized as the official head and representative
of the city for all purposes. Such recognition shall not, however, include any
duties considered an unauthorized delegation of executive or legislative
authority from the Board of Commissioners.

with a department or division employee on policy implication matters without
involvement therein by the City Manager.
   (D)   No member of the Board of Commissioners shall communicate on a one-on-

which should effectuate interruption or redirection in the work assignment of a
worker or group of workers in any manner other than an initial request for work
assignment made directly to the director of the department or his or her
designee in his or her absence.
   (E)   Such a request for a work assignment shall be submitted to the
department director who has jurisdiction over such request work assignment,
regardless of its nature.
   (F)   Upon receipt of such a request for a work assignment, whether written
or oral, it is understood that the work assignment shall be delegated and/or
assigned solely at the director’s discretion, or by his or her designee in his
or her absence, without threat of retribution from said member of the Board of
Commissioners as to its priority of assignment within his or her department
unless a decision of the Commission members, in an appropriate setting directs
otherwise.
   (G)   It is the responsibility of each department director to assess the
requested work assignment and make a cursory determination as to whether such
individual request calls for priority treatment. In that event, the department
director shall so advise all the Commission members and the City Manager in the
same manner forthwith of such priority assignment so that all share equally in
the dissemination of information.
   (H)   No employee or group of employees shall express dissatisfaction in the
realm of their employment to any Commission member without first seeking to
remedy such situation administratively.
   (I)   In the event an employee or group of employees attempts to circumvent
such administrative remedies as provided in the personnel policy and/or working
agreement, it shall be incumbent upon the Commission member to decline to
circumvent or interfere in the administrative process.

or for an employer, labor organization or joint labor- management committee
controlling apprenticeship or other training or retraining programs to admit or

differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of
disability, age, sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sexual
orientation, gender identity, familial status, marital and/or parental status
and place of birth, nor is it an unlawful practice for an employer to give and

monthly report of complaints received and the status of each complaint.
      (3)   Administration and enforcement of this subchapter shall be as
follows.
         (a)   Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of this
chapter may, within 90 days of the alleged violation or within 30 days of the
dismissal of a charge or complaint concerning the same matter by another
governmental agency or state or federal court without a final judgment on the
merits, whichever last occurs, file a written complaint under oath with the
City Manager. The City Manager may designate an agent to fulfill the duties and
procedures outlined herein.
         (b)   A person who has filed a complaint with the Human Rights
Commission, and whose complaint is pending shall provide written notice to the
Human Rights Commission within five business days of the filing of any
complaint or charge on his or her behalf with another agency or state or
federal court that seeks relief or damages for the same alleged violation(s)
arising from the same transaction(s) or occurrence(s) upon which the person
seeks relief hereunder. Upon receiving notice of the other charge or complaint,
the Human Rights Commission shall have discretion to dismiss the complaint
filed hereunder. The failure to provide such notice in a timely manner may
result in the immediate dismissal of the complaint filed herein. The complaint
shall state:
            1.   The name and address (if known) of the alleged violator or
facts sufficient to identify such person;
            2.   An outline of the material facts upon which the complaint is
based;
            3.   The alleged violation;
            4.   Any conduct of the complainant was for the purpose of
obtaining the housing, employment or public accommodation in question and not
for the purpose of harassment or entrapment of the person against whom the
complaint is made; and
            5.   A complaint concerning this same matter has not been filed
with another agency or that any complaint concerning this matter filed with
another agency has been dismissed by such agency without a final judgment on
the merits.

         (e)   If the City Manager does not deem it practicable to attempt a
pre-investigation settlement or if such settlement attempt is unsuccessful, the
City Manager shall conduct an investigation to determine whether there is
probable cause to believe the allegations of the complaint.
         (f)   If the City Manager determines that there is no probable cause,
the City Manager shall dismiss the complaint. Written notice of the dismissal
shall be served upon the complainant by U.S. mail, postage prepaid. The notice

before a hearing officer of the Human Rights Commission, in writing, within 14
days and shall include a hearing request form with instructions as to how to
file that request.
         (g)   If the City Manager determines that there is sufficient basis in
fact to support the complaint, the City Manager shall endeavor to eliminate the
alleged violation by a conciliation agreement, signed by all parties and the
City Manager, wherein the alleged violation is eliminated and the complainant
is made whole to the greatest extent practicable.
         (h)   The City Manager shall furnish a copy of such signed
conciliation agreement to the complainant and the person charged. The terms of
the conciliation agreement may be made public, but no other information

complaint without prejudice.
         (k)   The Human Rights Commission shall have discretion to approve,
modify or reject the conciliation agreement. If the conciliation agreement is
modified or rejected, any interested party shall be entitled to a request to
pursue further reconciliation or other remedial action as provided herein.
      (4)   The City Manager shall have 30 days from the filing of the
complaint to attempt to eliminate the alleged violation by conciliation
agreement. In the event that either the complainant or the person or entity
charged indicates an unwillingness to participate in the conciliation process
or in the event that no conciliation process or no conciliation agreement has
been reached within the time provided, the City Manager shall refer the
complaint for hearing. The City Manager may continue attempts to reach a
conciliation agreement after referral of the complaint for hearing.
      (5)   The City Manager shall set a date for a hearing and notify the
complainant and the person or entity charged in writing at least ten days in
advance of that hearing date.
   (B)   Hearings.
      (1)   A hearing officer shall be appointed by the City Manager to preside

in the commonwealth.
      (2)   To the extent necessary for the full disclosure of all relevant
facts and issues, a hearing officer shall afford all parties the opportunity to

and submit rebuttal evidence. The hearing officer shall supervise and determine
what discovery will be appropriate, including, but not limited to,
interrogatories, requests for production of documents and depositions.

evidence.
         (d)   All evidence shall be presented in the presence of the hearing
officer.
      (6)   In an administrative hearing, findings of fact shall be based
exclusively on the evidence in the record. The strict rules of evidence
governing civil proceedings shall not apply; however, the hearing officer will
abide by the general principles of evidence in an effort to conduct a rational
and reasonable investigation to seek the truth of the matter. All findings of
fact shall be based upon a preponderance of the evidence. The order of proof
shall be that set forth in the state’s rules of civil procedure. The hearing
officer shall have the discretion to grant a continuance or continue a hearing
in progress on a showing of good cause.
      (7)   All testimony shall be made under oath or affirmation. Any part of
the evidence may be received in written form if doing so will expedite the
hearing without substantial prejudice to the interests of any party or if such
practice is authorized by statute. Any party shall have the right to inspect
the documentary or tangible evidence relating to an administrative hearing
either in person or by counsel. Copies of documentary evidence may be obtained
upon the payment of a fee, except documents protected from disclosure by state
or federal law.
      (8)   Objections to evidentiary offers may be made by any party and shall
be noted in the record.
      (9)   A hearing officer may take official notice of any matter of which a
court of the commonwealth may take such notice.
      (10)   The hearing officer may order the removal of a person who exhibits
disruptive behavior that interferes with the proceedings.
      (11)   A hearing officer shall cause all testimony in a hearing to be

thereof.
      (12)   Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the hearing, the
hearing officer shall issue a written order that shall include findings of
fact, conclusions of law and final disposition of the hearing. A copy of the
order shall be sent to each party, the City Manager and the Human Rights
Commission.
   (C)   Enforcement of orders.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a written order from the hearing officer finding no

dismissing the complaint. Upon receipt of a written order from the hearing
officer finding a violation of this subchapter, the Human Rights Commission may
issue one or more of the following orders:
         (a)   An order directing the person or entity found to have violated
this subchapter to cease and desist from the discriminating practice;
         (b)   For three or more willful violations, an order suspending or
terminating the occupational license of a person or entity found to have
violated this subchapter. In determining whether to suspend or terminate a
license under this section, the Human Rights Commission will consider equitable
factors, including, but not limited to, the following potential mitigating
factors: whether the owner of the business had knowledge of the violations; the
time between the violations; whether corrective measures were undertaken;
whether three or more violations occurred in connection with a single
transaction or occurrence affecting multiple complaints from various parties;
or whether the violations are discrete incidents that fail to indicate a
systemic intent to discriminate;
         (c)   For three or more willful violations, an order suspending or
terminating the license to operate residential rental property of a person or
entity found to have violated this subchapter; and/or
         (d)   An order subjecting any person or entity found to have violated
this chapter to civil penalties of not less than $100 or more than $250.
      (2)   Upon entering its order, the Human Rights Commission shall send a
copy of its order to all parties to the complaint by U.S. mail, postage
prepaid.
   (D)   Appeals.
      (1)   The orders of the Human Rights Commission, and the findings and
conclusions upon which it was based, may be appealed to the county’s Circuit
Court within 30 days of the Commission’s order.
      (2)   Any respondent or complainant aggrieved by an order of the
Commission, or any complainant aggrieved by an order of dismissal of his or her
complaint by the Commission, may obtain a review of such order in the Circuit
Court by filing with the Clerk of Court, within 30 days after service on he or
she of the order, a written petition praying that such order be modified or set
aside, and by serving a duplicate copy of the petition on the Commission, the
City Manager and the other parties to the complaint.
   (E)    Enforcement by civil action. The city may enforce the orders of the
Human Rights Commission or the terms of any conciliation agreement by a civil
action in a court of competent jurisdiction. Violations may be subject to
abatement by restraining order or injunction. Such civil enforcement shall be
in addition to any other penalty imposed by this code. The city shall be
entitled to recover all court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by it
in enforcing any provision of this chapter by civil action.

   (A)   DEFAULT, as used herein, is defined as:
      (1)   The failure of a respondent to appear at a hearing; and

like, direct or indirect, made or done by a respondent or any of his or her
agents or attorneys on his or her behalf, which:
         (a)   Induces or helps to induce a person other than the respondent to
refrain from testifying before, discussing a matter with or misrepresenting any

misrepresentation of a fact to the hearing officer.
   (B)   Whenever the hearing officer decides by clear and convincing evidence

hearing officer to make findings of fact sustaining the averments of the
complaint without resort to testimony.

default.
   (B)   (1)   Based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law, the
hearing officer shall, as to each respondent, either recommend dismissal of the

to the respondent to cease and desist from the prohibited discriminatory
practice or practices and take such affirmative action as detailed in KRS 344,
Title VIII of the Federal Civil Rights Act, as amended, or this subchapter, as
the Commission deems necessary to remedy the violation and to prevent its
continuation or recurrence.
      (2)   All Commission orders made under these rules shall be served upon
each claimant and respondent affected by the order.

§ 32.052 FURTHER REMEDY.
   (A)   In addition to any remedial order or civil penalty, if the Commission
finds that any person has committed an unlawful practice with regard to
housing, as defined in this subchapter, it may subject such person to a fine
not greater than civil penalties established by the Federal Fair Housing Act in
§ 812. The Commission may, if such person refuses to pay the fine, file an
action in the county’s Circuit Court for the collection thereof.
   (B)   If a real estate broker, a real estate salesperson, or an employee
thereof has failed to comply with any order issued by the Commission, or has
been found to have committed an unlawful housing discrimination practice in
violation of this chapter, the Commission shall so notify in writing the Real
Estate Commission of the commonwealth.

opposed a practice declared unlawful by this chapter or because he or she has
filed a complaint, testified, assisted or participated in any manner in any
investigation, proceeding, hearing or conference before the City Manager,

      (2)   To aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce any person to engage in any
of the practices prohibited by this subchapter or to obstruct or prevent any
person from complying with the provisions of this subchapter;
      (3)   To obstruct or prevent a person from complying with the provisions
of this subchapter, or any order of the Commission issued thereunder; or
      (4)   To resist, prevent, impede or interfere with the City Manager, the

maliciously injure another party, such as, but not limited to, filing a false
or misleading claim or defense; or filing a complaint or asserting a defense
that is not warranted under existing law and that cannot be supported by a good

eligible for reinstatement for a period of one year following his or her
separation from the Fire Department, and shall be reinstated only:
         (a)   With the approval of the appointing authority;
         (b)   Upon favorable recommendation of the Fire Chief and City Manager

DRUGS
§ 33.35 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE.
   In order to provide a drug-free workplace, the following policy has been
drawn to reiterate and state in a more formal way the work-related effects of
drug use and unlawful possession of controlled substances on city premises, or
while conducting city business.
   (A)   Employees are expected and required to report to work on time and in
appropriate mental and physical condition for work. It is the city’s intent and
obligation to provide a drug-free, healthful, safe and secure work environment.
   (B)   The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or
use of a controlled substance on city premises or while conducting city
business off city premises is absolutely prohibited. Violations of this policy
will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may
have legal consequences.
   (C)   The city recognizes drug dependency as an illness and a major health
problem. The city also recognizes drug abuse as a potential health, safety and
security problem. Employees needing help in dealing with such problems are
encouraged to use the city’s employee assistance program and health insurance
plans, as appropriate. Conscientious efforts to seek such help will not
jeopardize any employee’s job.
   (D)   Employees must, as a condition of employment, abide by the terms of
the above policy and report any conviction under a criminal drug statute for
violations occurring on or off city premises while conducting city business. A
report of a conviction must be made within five days after the conviction.
   (E)   Appropriate personnel action against any employee convicted of a
criminal drug offense will be taken within 30 days of the date the employer
learns of conviction. Such action can range from discharge to a requirement of
satisfactory participation in a drug abuse, assistance or rehabilitation
program.
(1984 Code, § 33.35) (Ord. O-28-17, passed 11-28-2017)
FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY
§ 33.50 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The city will provide eligible employees with up to a total of 12 work
weeks of leave during any rolling 12-month period measured backward from the
date leave is used for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Due to the birth, placement or adoption of a child and to care for
such child;
      (2)   Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee
unable to perform the functions of his or her position; or
      (3)   To care for the employee’s spouse, child or parent who suffers from
a serious health condition. The employee must substitute any paid sick days or
accrued paid vacation leave towards the 12 weeks of leave. If paid sick days or
vacation leave is substituted for family and medical leave, the city will
notify the employee that the paid leave is being counted toward the employee’s
family and medical leave entitlement.
   (B)   If the employee is injured in connection with work and is receiving
time off and benefits under state workers’ compensation laws, then the period
of time which he or she is absent from work will be charged concurrently
against his or her 12-week family and medical leave entitlement. Family and
medical leave is only available to employees who have been employed for at
least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the previous 12-
month period. Family and medical leave is not available to part-time or
temporary employees or to employees who work at a worksite at which there are
fewer than 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.
(1984 Code, § 33.50) (Ord. O-28-17, passed 11-28-2017)
§ 33.51 WAGES AND BENEFITS.
   (A)   No wages will be paid to the employee during his or her family and
medical leave of absence with the exception of substituted paid sick days or
accrued paid vacation leave.
   (B)   If the employee takes family and medical leave, he or she will not
lose employment benefits that accrued before the date leave began. While he or
she is on leave, the city will pay, on his or her behalf, the costs of any
benefits from group coverage paid by a group premium (e.g., life insurance) and
its portion, if any, of health insurance benefits. The employee will have the
option to continue any other available benefits at his or her own expense. If
the employee is delinquent in paying his or her share of benefit premiums and
the delinquency continues for 15 days after the city gives the employee notice
of his or her delinquency, then his or her benefits will be canceled. The
employee will not accrue vacation and sick time during his or her leave.
   (C)   If the employee takes family and medical leave and does not complete
at least 30 days of additional employment, he or she shall immediately
reimburse the city for any amount paid by the city during the leave period,
excluding the period consisting of paid sick days and vacation leave
substituted for family and medical leave, for its portion, if any, of the
employee’s health insurance premiums, unless the failure to return for at least
30 days of additional employment is due to the continuation, recurrence or
onset of a serious health condition of his or her spouse or child, or some
other extenuating circumstance beyond his or her control.
   (D)   If the employee fails to return to work because of the continuation,
recurrence or onset of a serious health condition of his or her spouse or
child, then he or she must provide the city with medical certification of his
or her family member’s serious health condition within 30 days from the date he
or she notifies the city that he or she will not return to work. If the
employee does not provide the medical certification in a timely manner, then
the city can recover the portion of health care premiums paid by the city on
his or her behalf as set forth in division (C) above.
(1984 Code, § 33.51) (Ord. O-28-17, passed 11-28-2017)
§ 33.52 RETURN TO WORK.
   (A)   With the exception of taking leave due to the birth, placement or
adoption of a child or to care for such child, the employee must return to work
immediately upon becoming able to return. Failure to do so will be treated as a
voluntary termination. In no event shall the employee take more than 12 weeks
of family and medical leave during any rolling 12-month period.
   (B)   The employee will have the same right to restoration and other
benefits as he or she would have enjoyed if he or she had been continuously
employed during the leave period. Ordinarily, upon return to work, he or she
will be restored to the same position he or she held when leave began, if that
position is still available. If the position is no longer available, he or she
will be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits and
other terms and conditions of employment.
   (C)   As a condition of restoration, when returning from leave taken due to
the employees’ own serious health condition, he or she must provide the Human
Resources Specialist with a fitness for duty certification. The return to work
fitness for duty examination and certification must be conducted and prepared
by a health care provider selected or at least agreed upon by the city. The
fitness for duty examination and certification shall be limited to the
condition which caused the need for leave. The certification must set forth
work restrictions, if any.
   (D)   The city will not guarantee restoration of employment if the employee
takes more than 12 work weeks of family and medical leave during any 12-month
period.
   (E)   The city may deny restoration to any “key employee” if denial of
restoration is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to
the city’s operation. A key employee is a salaried employee who is among the
highest paid 10% of those employed by the city within 75 miles of the office at
which the employee works. If an employee is a key employee, the city will
notify him or her when he or she requests leave if the city believes there is a
possibility that he or she will not be restored at the end of the leave period.
If the city determines that economic injury would result, then the city will
immediately notify the employee, in writing, either delivered in person or by
certified mail, of its intent not to restore him or her to his or her previous
position. If leave has already started, the employee will have the option to
return to work and be restored to his or her position.
   (F)   If the employee is on leave, the city will require him or her to
report periodically on his or her status and intent to return to work. If he or
she gives notice of his or her intent not to return to work, then the city’s
obligation to maintain benefits and restore employment will cease. If
circumstances of the employee’s leave change and he or she is able to return to
work earlier than the date he or she previously indicated, then he or she must
notify the city at least two work days prior to the date he or she intends to
return.
(1984 Code, § 33.52) (Ord. O-28-17, passed 11-28-2017)
§ 33.53 LEAVE FOR BIRTH, PLACEMENT OR ADOPTION OF A CHILD.
   (A)   If the employee is eligible, he or she is entitled to take leave due
to the birth, placement or adoption of a child or to care for the child. The
leave may begin prior to the birth, placement or adoption, but the right to
leave, based on one of these events, will expire 12 months after the birth,
placement or adoption.
   (B)   Both mother and father are entitled to leave. If both mother and
father are employed by the city, they may both take leave, but the total number
of weeks cannot exceed 12 work weeks.
   (C)   The employee must give the Human Resources Department 30 days’ notice
before the date leave is to begin. If the need for leave or the timing of the
leave is unforeseeable, he or she must give the Human Resources Department
notice of the need for leave as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
two working days of learning for the need for the leave.
   (D)   Leave due to birth, placement or adoption of a child cannot be taken
intermittently or on a reduced schedule basis unless the Human Resources
Department gives written approval.
(1984 Code, § 33.53) (Ord. O-28-17, passed 11-28-2017)
§ 33.54 LEAVE FOR SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION.
   (A)   If the employee is eligible, he or she is entitled to take leave
because of a serious health condition that makes him or her unable to perform
the functions of his or her position or to care for his or her spouse, child or
parent who suffers from a serious health condition.
   (B)   A serious health condition is a physical or mental impairment,
illness, injury or condition that involves one of the following:
      (1)   Hospital care. Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection
with or consequent to inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,

      (2)   Absence plus treatment. Any period of incapacity requiring absence
from work, school or other regular daily activities of more than three
consecutive calendar days, that also involves:
         (a)   Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, by a

provider, or by a nurse or physician’s assistant under direct supervision of a
health care provider;
         (b)   Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring
episodes of a single underlying condition); and
         (c)   May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity
(e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy and the like).
   (C)   (1)   Permanent/long-term conditions requiring supervision. A period
of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which
treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the

terminal stages of a disease.
      (2) Multiple treatments (non-chronic conditions). Any period of absence
to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery therefrom) by
a health care provider or by a provider of health care services under orders
of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for restorative surgery
after an accident or other injury, or for a condition that would likely result
in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive days in the absence of
medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer (chemotherapy, radiation and
the like), severe arthritis (physical therapy) and/or kidney disease
(dialysis).
   (D)   For purposes of this policy, the term HEALTH CARE PROVIDER refers to

practice under state law and who is performing within the scope of his or her
practice as defined under state law;
      (4)   A Christian Science practitioner listed with the First Church of

examination, though not treatment, to obtain a second or third certification
from a health care provider other than a Christian Science practitioner;

employed by the city, and the leave is taken to care for a sick spouse or
child, then each employee can take 12 weeks of leave. If the leave is taken to
care for a sick parent, then the total number of weeks for both husband and
wife cannot exceed 12 weeks.
   (F)   If the need for leave is foreseeable, the employee must give the Human
Resources Department 30 days’ notice. If the need for leave or the timing of

leave as soon as practicable, but in no event later than two working days of
learning for the need for the leave.
   (G)   The employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule medical
treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the city’s operations, subject to
approval of the health care provider.
   (H)   The employee may take leave intermittently or on a reduced scheduled
basis if medically necessary. If he or she takes leave intermittently or on a
reduced schedule, the city may require him or her to transfer temporarily to an
available alternative position for which he or she is qualified that better
accommodates recurring leave and has equivalent pay and benefits.
   (I)   If the employee takes leave due to his or her own serious health
condition, or that of a spouse, child or parent, he or she must, within 15 days
of the beginning date of leave, provide the Human Resources Specialist with
written certification from a health care provider of certain basic information
about him or her or his or her family member’s condition. The city will provide
the employee with a form prepared by the United States Department of Labor in
order to collect the information from him or her.
   (J)   If the city questions the certification, the city can, at its own
expense, require that the employee get a second opinion from another health
care provider of the city’s choice so long as the second provider is not
regularly employed by the city. If the second opinion differs from the first
opinion, the city may require, at its own expense, a third opinion from a
provider jointly selected by the city and the employee, which opinion will be
final and binding.
   (K)   If the city questions the certification, the city can also employ a
health care provider to contact the employee’s health care provider to obtain
clarification and authentication of the information included in his or her
certification. The city’s health care provider will not ask the employee’s
health care provider for a diagnosis. If the city requests the employee’s
permission to have its health care provider contact the employee’s health care
provider, the city will expect his or her cooperation.
   (L)   The city may require recertification on a reasonable basis.
   (M)   The city will maintain and treat as confidential all records submitted
in connection with requests for family and medical leave.

   (A) The city hereby adopts the following personnel and pay classification
plan, including the compensation and classification plan contained in division
(J) below, in accordance with KRS § 83A.070 and other applicable law. Pursuant

payments are not permitted under state law and shall not be made.
   (D)   City employees and non-elected officials may receive longevity pay in
accordance with the respective working agreements for positions covered in each
working agreement and the city’s personnel policy. The calculation of longevity
pay is as follows:
 
Annual Longevity = (Longevity Rate) multiplied by (Years of Service)
multiplied by (12 months)
 
   (E)   All agents and employees of the city, and in certain circumstances
professionals appointed by the City Manager to fulfill an assignment on a
temporary basis, may, for temporary periods of time and to meet emergency or
exigent conditions, be assigned by the City Manager to any department in which
they or any of their services may be required, and in addition thereto, shall
perform such other duties as may be required by the City Manager in conformity
with general laws of the commonwealth and the ordinances, rules and regulations
of the city. The City Manager may approve a rate or method of pay or salary for
persons in this category.
   (F)   Provisions for wages, pay, salaries and benefits are provided for
employees who are provided coverage under the collective bargaining agreements,
including, but not limited to, step in grade, and supplemental pay and other
categories of pay, with the city, and those provisions are adopted by
reference, incorporated herein, and approved in this section. Lump sum payments
for services rendered may be made in accordance with the terms of the working
agreements including when a working agreement has expired and an agreement to
cover the time when the expiration of the agreement occurred.
   (G)   Co-op, seasonal and temporary employees shall be paid on a bi-weekly
basis the same as all other city employees. All compensation shall be paid at
the applicable rate according to the compensation and classification plan
herein and as appropriated in the approved annual budget. Co-op, seasonal and
temporary employees receive no other benefits and no pay on holidays. The City
Manager may hire and assign co-op, seasonal and temporary employees.
   (H)   Characteristics and duties or responsibilities of a classification in
the compensation and classification plan are general statements or references
as categories indicating the level of responsibility and discretion of
positions in that job classification. They do not limit or restrict the range
of duties and responsibilities that may be assigned or required of an
individual in a particular job classification.
   (I)   Position identification, job descriptions and working titles: specific
job titles and descriptions for each position shall be adopted or amended by
City Manager administrative order and shall be recorded on a form document
known as a job description.
      (1)   Each job description shall identify a specific title for a position
which fits within an appropriate classification in the compensation and
classification plan herein.
      (2)   Job descriptions shall describe and explain the job duties and
responsibilities typically assigned to a position within a particular
classification under the compensation and classification plan herein.
      (3)   Minimum requirements as reflected in job descriptions shall be
comprehensive statements of the minimum background as to education, experience
and other qualifications which will be required in all cases as evidence of an
appointee’s ability to perform the work properly.
      (4)   The City Clerk and Human Resources Director shall maintain a
library of all approved job descriptions. These job descriptions shall
constitute the official job titles and class specifications in the city’s
classification plan. The copies of the specification for each job description
shall indicate the date of adoption or the last revision of the specification.
      (5)   Job descriptions shall be available for inspection by any employee
under reasonable conditions during business hours.
      (6)   The job description associated with a specific position shall be
used to designate the position in all payroll and other official records and
documents.
      (7)   Job descriptions shall be developed and retained for each city
employee and/or position. If the duties and responsibilities assigned to a
position are to be changed in a material and permanent way, the department head
making the recommendation shall submit to the Human Resources Director a
revised position description stating the duties and responsibilities to be
assigned. If the changes to the duties would indicate that the position is not
classified appropriately, the position may be reclassified to the most
appropriate job classification under the compensation and classification plan
herein. The Human Resources Director may make recommendations to the City
Manager to modify the job description to more accurately describe job functions
that have been or may be assigned to a job class or position. Any revisions of
job descriptions must be approved by City Manager administrative order. No less
than annually, the City Manager and Human Resources Director shall provide to
the Board of Commissioners an updated list of all job positions and a summary
of any revisions.
      (8)   In addition to formal job titles identified in job descriptions, a
more specific “working title” may be used in the interest of improving city
operations. Such working titles should describe the function of a position in a
manner that is more easily recognized for purposed of internal or external
communications. The City Manager and Human Resources Director shall oversee all
requests for the creation of working titles. If approved, working titles shall
be documented through the use of a City Manager administrative order amending a
job description. The City Clerk shall keep a list of all approved working
titles which have been adopted by City Manager administrative order.
   (J)   Positions that are open to the general public shall be posted on the
city’s website for a minimum of 14 days. Job postings shall be sent to each
city department for posting as well as appropriate recruiting sources to
attract a diverse candidate pool. The deadline date of any posting may be
extended based upon application response.
   (K)   All new hires, individual promotions and pay increases shall be
approved annually by ordinance when the budget ordinance is approved and/or
amended in accordance with applicable state law. New hires, individual
promotions and pay increases that were not approved during the budgeting
process will require Commission approval when they occur.
   (L)   Pay for certain employees may be greater or less the ranges provided
for in the compensation and classification plan under exigent or unusual
circumstances including, but not limited to: when an employee may exhibit
extraordinary skill, knowledge, experience or educational qualifications; and/
or when the market requires that in order to employ or retain such an employee
it is necessary to pay that person an amount greater than provided in the
salary ranges approved herein; and/or based on length of service; and/or when
an employee can be retained and hired to perform duties for less than the
ranges indicated in a category.
   (M)   The classification numbers/categories and compensation ranges for
employees of the city (unless otherwise noted) whose positions are not

(1984 Code, § 34.01) (Ord. O-27-19, passed 8-13-2019)
§ 34.02 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE.
   In order to provide a drug-free workplace, the following policy has been
drawn to reiterate and state in a more formal way the work-related effects of
drug use and unlawful possession of controlled substances on city premises, or
while conducting city business.
   (A)   Employees are expected and required to report to work on time and in
appropriate mental and physical condition for work. It is the city’s intent and
obligation to provide a drug-free, healthful, safe and secure work environment.
   (B)   The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or
use of a controlled substance on city premises or while conducting city
business off city premises is absolutely prohibited. Violations of this policy
will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may
have legal consequences.
   (C)   (1)   The city recognizes drug dependency as an illness and a major
health problem. The city also recognizes drug abuse as a potential health,
safety and security problem. Employees needing help in dealing with such
problems are encouraged to use the city’s employee assistance program and
health insurance plans, as appropriate.
      (2)   Conscientious efforts to seek such help will not jeopardize any
employee’s job.
   (D)   (1)   Employees must, as a condition of employment, abide by the terms
of the above policy and report any conviction under a criminal drug statute for
violations occurring on or off city premises while conducting city business.
      (2)   A report of a conviction must be made within five days after the
conviction.
   (E)   Appropriate personnel action against any employee convicted of a
criminal drug offense will be taken within 30 days of the date the employer
learns of conviction. Such action can range from discharge to a requirement of
satisfactory participation in a drug abuse, assistance or rehabilitation
program.
   (F)   In addition to the policy set forth above, the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) has issued regulations which require that mandatory
alcohol and drug testing procedures be applied to all city employees subject to
commercial driver license (CDL) testing and licensing procedures. These FHWA
requirements are in addition to the city’s rules for use and/or possession of
alcohol/drugs, and are not to be interpreted as a replacement thereof.
      (1)   Definitions.
         ALCOHOL. A colorless volatile flammable liquid (C2H5OH) formed by
vinous fermentation and contained in wine, beer, whiskey and other fermented
and distilled liquors of which it is the intoxicating principle, that is
manufactured principally by fermentation of carbohydrate materials and by
hydration of ethylene, being obtained usually by fractional distillation in a
concentration of about 95% with about 5% water; any of a class of compounds
analogous to ethyl alcohol in constitution and regarded as hydroxyl derivatives
of hydrocarbons being classed according to the number of hydroxyl derivatives
of hydrocarbons being classed according to the number of hydroxyl groups (as
monohydric, dihydric, trihydric, polyhydric) or according to structure.
         BAT. Breath alcohol test.
         CDL. Commercial driver’s license.
         DOT. Department of Transportation.
         DRUG. Marijuana (THC metabolite), cocaine, amphetamines, opiates
(including heroin) and phencyclidine (PCP), as defined in KRS Ch. 218A.
         EAP. Employee Assistance Program.
         FHWA. Federal Highway Admini- stration.
         MRO. Medical review officer.
      (2)   Rules. In addition to the rules set forth in the city’s Drug-Free
Workplace Policy for alcohol and drug abuse, the following uses of alcohol are
prohibited by employees who maintain a CDL:
         (a)   Use while performing safety- sensitive functions;
         (b)   Use during the four hours prior to performing safety-sensitive
functions; and
         (c)   Use eight hours following an accident or until the employee
passes a post-accident test.
      (3)   Drug/alcohol testing program.
         (a)   A procedure of integrity. The city will test for the use of
illegal drugs and alcohol in accordance with the safeguards as to privacy,
procedure, accuracy and confidentiality contained in the federal guidelines of
the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and in certain
of the regulations of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Specimen collection will be
conducted at a designated site and according to federal guidelines. Pursuant to
the above federal regulations, complete privacy in collection of the urine
sample is required unless there is reason to believe that a particular
individual may alter or substitute the specimen. The DOT/FHWA regulations
narrowly define the circumstances under which observed urine samples may be
taken.
            1.   Being selected for drug or alcohol testing implies no guilt or
wrongdoing. It is simply part of a comprehensive and effective overall program,
for the benefit of all concerned.
            2.   Specimen testing will be conducted by a laboratory certified
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). All positive drug results must
be confirmed by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry testing. The employee has
the further right to retesting of the drug sample as under the DOT/FHWA
program.
            3.   A Medical Review Officer (M.R.O.) qualified in the field of
drug and alcohol testing, will be selected by the city. Test results will be
maintained by the M.R.O., and confidentially maintained as under the DOT/FHWA
regulations. The M.R.O. will notify the employee of a verified positive test
and his or her right to retesting of the split sample within 72 hours of
notification.
         (b)   Types of testing.
            1.   Pre-employment. Upon selection of an applicant for hire; full-
time, part-time or seasonal, the individual will be required to be drug tested
for illegal use. The city will not hire anyone who tests “positive”. Any
applicant who is being considered for a position requiring a CDL, or who will
be required to obtain a CDL after six months of employment, will also be tested
for alcohol use.
            2.   Random. The city is required to randomly test for the illegal
use of drugs and alcohol. Selection for random testing will be done by a third-
party computer program (the M.R.O.). Fifty percent of the safety-sensitive test
pool will be tested yearly for the illegal use of marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP). Twenty-five percent of the safety-
sensitive test pool will be tested yearly for the use of alcohol.
            3.   Post accident. City employees involved in an on-the-job
accident will be tested for the use of illegal drugs and alcohol within two
hours after the accident, but no more than eight hours after the accident. For
purposes of this policy, an ACCIDENT is defined as an occurrence associated
with the operator of a city vehicle that results in:
               a.   A fatality;
               b.   An individual suffers bodily injury requiring immediate
attention at a medical facility;
               c.   The vehicle involved in the accident suffers disabling
damage requiring that it be towed away;
               d.   The arrest of the operator; or
               e.   A citation is issued by law enforcement.
            4.   Reasonable suspicion. All employees are subject to a drug/
alcohol test when there is a reason to suspect drug use or alcohol misuse
immediately prior to, during or immediately after performing job duties. A
referral for testing will be made on the basis of specific, contemporaneous,
articulable observation concerning the appearance, speech, behavior or body
odors of the covered employee which characterize prohibited drug use or alcohol
misuse, such referrals will be made by supervisory personnel who are trained to
detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use.
            5.   Conditions. The following conditions are signs of possible
drug or alcohol use, but are not all inclusive:
               a.   Abnormally dilated or constricted pupils;
               b.   Glazed stare - redness of eyes (sclera);
               c.   Flushed face;
               d.   Change of speech (i.e., faster or slower);
               e.   Increased absences or tardiness;
               f.   Sudden weight loss;
               g.   Change in personality (i.e., paranoia);
               h.   Forgetfulness or perform- ance/concentration problems;
               i.   Borrowing money from co-workers or seeking an advance of
pay or other unusual displays of asking for money;
               j.   Constant fatigue or hyperactivity;
               k.   Smell of alcohol;
               l.   Slurred speech;
               m.   Difficulty walking;
               n.   Dulled mental processes; and
               o.   Slowed reaction rate.
            6.   When a supervisor has reason to believe that one or more of
the above conditions are present, they should confront the employee involved
and keep the employee under direct observation until the situation is resolved.
            7.   If an employee is identified as needing assistance in
resolving problems associated with drug or alcohol misuses, the employee shall
be evaluated by a substance abuse professional (SAP), as defined by the FHWA
regulations. The substance abuse professional will monitor the employee’s
compliance with any rehabilitation programs prescribed. The employee will be
subject to unannounced follow-up tests directed by the substance abuse
professional, and will consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months
following the employee’s return to duty.
         (c)   Alcohol testing. Testing for alcohol concentrations will be
conducted using a National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) approved
evidential breath testing (EBT) device operated by a trained technician (BAT).
An employee who tests at an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or above on an
initial screening test must be retested at least 15, nor more than 20, minutes
after the completion of the screening test. This second test is called a
confirmatory test. A confirmatory test showing an alcohol concentration of 0.02
to 0.039 will cause the employee to be removed from his or her safety-sensitive
position for 24 hours; a test result of 0.04 or greater will be a violation of
the rule. The individual must be evaluated by a substance abuse professional
and follow and complete all recommendations to return to duty.
         (d)   Compliance for request for testing. Any employee who refuses a
request for testing; who provided false information in connection with a test;
who attempts to falsify test results through tampering, contamination,
alteration or substitution; who is unable to provide an adequate urine specimen
and upon medical evaluation such inability is determined not to be genuine; who
attempts and fails to provide an adequate breath sample without a valid medical
reason; who does not arrive at the collection site in a timely manner; or who,
without a valid reason, does not remain readily available before a test has
been conducted shall be considered as refusing to be tested and removed from
duty in compliance with DOT regulations, and in accordance with disciplinary
procedures set forth by the city.
         (e)   Safety-sensitive functions/job classifications to be tested in
accordance with FHWA/DOT regulations. In order to comply with FHWA/DOT
regulations, the job classifications listed below shall be considered safety-
sensitive functions which are required to be randomly tested for drug and
alcohol use in accordance with the requirements of the standard. The job
classifications shall include those that require a CDL and any other employees
who maintain a CDL. Job classifications that will be tested:
            1.   Driver;
            2.   Light equipment operator;
            3.   Heavy equipment operator; and
            4.   Any other employees who maintain a CDL.
         (f)   Discipline. Under FTA rules, discipline for drug and alcohol
program violations is determined at the local level. The city discipline policy
for alcohol misuse and/or drug abuse conduct follows below; however, individual
circumstance pertaining to a positive drug test, and alcohol test with a
concentration above 0.02, or a refusal to test may merit additional
consideration.
            1.   Any employee whose test from a random test, reasonable
suspicion or post- accident basis shows an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
higher, or is positive for any drug as defined in division (F)(1) above or
whose actions constitute a refusal will:
               a.   Be removed from their safety-sensitive position;
               b.   Be referred to and assessed by an SAP;
               c.   Be subject to discipline subject to the filing of charges
with the Non-Uniform Civil Service Board;
               d.   If deemed necessary by the SAP, be referred to and complete
a treatment and rehabilitation program;
               e.   If allowed to return to duty, be seen by the SAP to
determine compliance with any recommended or prescribed substance abuse program
and then tested for drugs and/or alcohol before returning to duty. Tests must
be negative of drugs and show an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02; and
               f.   Agree to return to work agreement developed in conjunction
with the SAP and the city outlining terms of return to work, including ongoing
treatment, aftercare conditions and additional unannounced follow-up tests for
a minimum of one year, with a minimum of six tests the first year.
            2.   All refusals will be treated as a violation of the rules,
recorded as a positive test, and the employee shall become subject to
discipline up to and including discharge.
            3.   Additional measures for discipline are listed in the city’s
drug-free workplace policy and personnel policies.
         (g)   Education and training. It is the policy of the city that
training and education programs will be made available to all employees.
Additionally, supervisors and managers will receive instruction on how to
identify the signs of drug and/or alcohol use or impairment and what to do in
such reasonable suspicion cases. This training will be conducted by qualified
professionals selected by the city. Additional and continuing drug and alcohol
education and training will be provided as necessary.
         (h)   Employee assistance program. The city has made available a
qualified third-party for counseling and related assistance to any employee
with a drug or alcohol problem, pursuant to the Employee Assistance Program
(EAP). Use of the EAP is strongly encouraged. Employees should contact the
counselor in confidence about their problem. Use of the EAP or disclosures to
the counselor will not result in disciplinary action to the person seeking
help. If appropriate, and with the permission of the employee, the counselor
will arrange for the employee to take accrued vacation leave, sick leave or a
personal leave of absence for counseling/rehabilitation. It is the
responsibility of each employee to seek assistance from the EAP before the
alcohol or drug problem leads to disciplinary action. If a rule violation has
already been found, or is independently found, using the EAP on a voluntary
basis will not necessarily lessen disciplinary action and may, in fact, have no
bearing on the determination of appropriate disciplinary action.

federal government, while on approved leave of absence from the city, subject
to a maximum credit for such service on one year; and
         (c)   Service in any branch of the armed forces of the United States
during a period of national emergency while on leave of absence from the city;
provided that:
            1.   Such leave of absence service does not exceed five years; and
            2.   Such member re-enters the service of the city within a period
of six months following the date of honorable discharge from such service.
   (B)   Computation of service credit. In the computation of service credit,
nine months or more of service during a year entitles a member to one year of
service, six to nine months of service constitutes three-quarters of a year,
three to six months, one-half year, and less than three months, one-quarter of
a year.
   (C)   Withdraw from service prior to retirement; waiver of rights.
      (1)   Upon the withdrawal from service prior to retirement, a member
shall be entitled to receive a refund of all of the amount of contributions
made by the member, without interest.
      (2)   Any members receiving a refund of contributions shall thereby
forfeit, waive and relinquish all accrued rights and benefits in the retirement
system, including all credited and creditable service.
      (3)   The Board may, regardless of cause, withhold payment of a refund
for a period not to exceed six months after receipt of an application from a
member.
   (D)   Re-employment of person receiving refund; reinstatement into the Fund.
      (1)   Any member who has received a refund shall be considered a new
member upon subsequent re-employment if such person qualified for membership
under this subchapter.
      (2)   After the completion of at least five years of continuous
membership service following his or her latest re-employment, such member shall
have the right to make a repayment to the Fund of the amount previously
received as a refund, including 6% interest from the date of refund to the date
of repayment. Upon the restoration of such refunds, the member shall have
reinstated to his or her account all credited service represented by the
refunds of which repayment has been made.
      (3)   Repayment of refunds by any member shall include all refunds
received by a member prior to the date of his or her last withdrawal from
service and shall be made in a single sum.
   (E)   Employee’s contribution; salary deduction.
      (1)   Each active member shall contribute a sum, not to exceed 8% of his
or her current salary, which shall be determined and fixed by the Board of
Commissioners as deemed necessary. The city is authorized to deduct such amount
from the salary of each active member at the close of each payroll period.
      (2)   The contribution shall be made as a deduction from salary,
notwithstanding that the salary paid in cash to such member may be reduced
thereby below the legally established rate.
      (3)   Every member of the Fund shall be deemed to consent and agree to
the deduction from his or her salary. Payment to such member of his or her
salary, less such deduction, shall constitute a full and complete discharge and
acquittance of all claims and demand whatsoever for the services rendered by
such member during the period covered by the payment, except as to the benefits
herein provided.
   (F)   City’s contribution.
      (1)   As used in this section, ACTUARILY SOUND CONDITION and ON AN
ACTUARILY FUNDED BASIS shall mean a financial condition and status of the
Pension Fund which will permit the payment of all retirement, disability and
all other benefits accruing to employees who are beneficiaries of the Fund when
due, under existing and all prior ordinances and amendments thereto whichever
benefit is the greater.
      (2)   For each fiscal year, the city’s contribution to the Fund shall be
fixed by the Board of Commissioners to be:
         (a)   An amount at least equal to the total contributions made by the
members during the same period; plus
         (b)   Such additional amount as may be deemed adequate to maintain the
Fund in an actuarily sound condition and on an actuarily funded basis. Such sum
shall be determined by a qualified and reputable actuary or actuarial firm to
be selected by agreement of the Board of Commissioners and the Board of
Trustees.
      (3)   An actuary or actuarial firm shall be employed on a continuing
basis to fix the sum herein provided for. The actuary or actuarial firm shall
at least each five years, prior to the adoption of this city’s annual budget,
certify to each Board the sum he or she deems adequate to maintain the Fund.
The sum shall be included in each annual budget and tax duly levied therefor.
During such five years after each actuarial report, the annual amount and tax
levy therefor shall be no less than the annual sums certified by the actuary.
   (G)   Maintenance of records system. An adequate system of accounts and
records shall be established and maintained for the Fund that shall reflect
fully the requirements of this subchapter. This system shall be integrated to
the extent possible with the accounts, records and procedures of the city to
the end that the system shall operate most effectively, at minimum expense and
that duplication of records and accounts may be avoided.
   (H)   Assignment of benefits restricted.
      (1)   The right to a retirement annuity, disability annuity, survivors
annuity or benefit, death benefit or any other benefit or refund under this
subchapter, is personal with the recipient thereof. The assignment or transfer
of such benefit or any part thereof shall be void, except as herein provided.
      (2)   No annuity, benefit or refund shall answer for debts contracted by
the person receiving the annuity, benefit or refund. No annuity, benefit or
refund shall be attached or affected by a judicial proceeding.
      (3)   Excepted herefrom are those judicial proceedings where the
underlying debt owed by the pensioner is due to the city or any of its pension
funds and the debt arose from actions involving moral turpitude.
   (I)   Payment of annuity.
      (1)   Any service retirement annuity, disability retirement annuity or
any other annuity provided in this subchapter shall be payable in equal monthly
installments as life annuities, and shall not be decreased, revoked or
repealed, except for error, where specifically otherwise provided or upon
written request. The cost of providing death benefits for members in receipt of
retirement annuities shall not be construed as a reduction in the life annuity
payable to the member.
      (2)   The first payment of an annuity shall be made for the fraction of a
month elapsing until the end of the first month, and the last payment shall be
made as of the end of the month in which death occurs.
   (J)   Liability of city for expenses. The payment of the required
contributions by the city, all allowances, annuities and benefits shall be the
obligation of the city. Administration expenses incurred in operating the Fund
shall be paid by the city.
(1984 Code, § 34.63) (Ord. O-39-64, passed 7-23-1964; Ord. O-8-71, passed 8-26-
1976; Ord. O-15-80, passed 2-19-1980; Ord. O-20-83, passed 4-19-1983)
§ 34.49 DEATH BENEFITS.
   (A)   Occupationally related death benefits.
      (1)   Upon death of a member due to occupational causes, regardless of
length of service, his or her surviving widow shall be entitled immediately
upon cessation of salary to an annuity equal to 50% of the member’s average
rate of salary. The annuity shall be payable until the widow dies or remarries.
      (2)   If minor children of the member under age 18 survive the deceased
member, the widow shall receive on account of each child, 10% of the member’s
last rate of salary until each child attains age 18. The combined payments to a
widow and minor child shall not exceed 70% of his or her average rate of
salary.
      (3)   If a widow does not survive the member, or if he or she remarries,
and minor children of the member under age 18 exist, each child is entitled to
an annuity equal to 10% of the member’s last rate of salary until each child
attains age 18, but the combined payments to such children shall not exceed 50%
of the member’s average rate of salary.
      (4)   If neither a widow nor minor children eligible for benefits survive
the member, each dependent parent is entitled to an annuity equal to 25% of the
member’s last rate of salary or 50% to both parents.
   (B)   Non-occupational death benefit.
      (1)   Upon death of a member occurring while in service, arising from any
cause other than in the performance of duty; provided, the member had at least
ten years of total service, his or her widow shall receive an annuity equal to
1.5% of average salary for each year of total service, credited to the member,
subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   The widow is at least 40 years of age, otherwise payment shall
be deferred until he or she attains such age. If the widow is or becomes
totally disabled before age 40, or has a minor child or children by the member
in his or her care under age 18, including adopted children provided the
proceedings for adoption were initiated at least one year prior to death of
member, payment of the widow’s annuity shall begin immediately together with an
additional allowance on account of the child or children.
         (b)   The widow’s annuity shall terminate in any event when the widow
remarries.
         (c)   The annuity of each child or children shall continue until each
child attains age 18.
      (2)   If the widow has any minor children by the member under age 18, the
annuity to the widow shall be increased by one-half on account of the first
child and by one-fourth on account of each additional child, subject to a
maximum combined payment to the widow and children of 50% of the final rate of
salary.
      (3)   The benefits provided under divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) above shall
also be payable upon death of the member while on retirement; provided, the
marriage was in effect for at least one year before retirement.
   (C)   Active service death benefits when no annuity due. Upon the death of a
member occurring while in active service, if no annuities are payable, the
designated beneficiary to the member or his or her estate shall be entitled to
a death benefit equal to the total contributions made by the member to the
Fund, without interest or $300, whichever is greater.
   (D)   Retirement death benefits when no annuity due.
      (1)   Upon the death of a retired member, if no annuities shall be due or
payable, a death benefit shall be paid to the designated beneficiary or estate
of the member equal to the excess, if any, of the total contributions made by
the member to this Fund to the date of retirement, without interest over the
total annuity payments received by the member. The minimum payment in such case
shall be $300.
      (2)   If any annuities are payable after the death of a retired member,
the amount of such death benefit, if any, shall be determined upon termination
of annuity payments to all survivors of the member, whether such termination
occurs by death, remarriage, or other cause.
(1984 Code, § 34.64) (Ord. O-39-64, passed 7-23-1964; Ord. O-15-80, passed 2-
19-1980)
§ 34.50 DISABILITY BENEFITS.
   (A)   Occupational disability. In the event of total and permanent
occupational disability, the member shall receive an annuity equal to 60% of
his or her rate of salary, based upon an average of the three highest salary
years. This benefit shall begin at such time as his or her salary may cease,
and shall be paid during his or her entire lifetime. Upon his or her death, his
or her eligible widow and minor children, if any, shall receive the benefits as
provided in §
34.49(B) of this chapter.
   (B)   Non-occupational disability.
      (1)   Upon total and permanent disability of a member as the result of
any cause other than occupational disability, if a member rendered at least ten
years of total service, he or she shall be entitled to a disability retirement
annuity. The amount of such annuity shall be equal to 2.5% of his or her
average salary for each full year of total service, subject to a minimum
payment of 25% of such average salary, and a maximum payment of 65% of his or
her average salary.
      (2)   Payment of the annuity shall be made during disability of the
member.
      (3)   Upon death of the member, if any eligible widow or minor children
survive, such survivors shall be entitled to the regular annuities provided
under §
34.49(B) of this chapter.
      (4)   Persons with 20 or more years of service may retire in accordance
with §
34.51(D) of this chapter.
   (C)   Non-occupational disability annuity; date of commencement. An annuity
for non-occupational disability shall begin to accrue upon the expiration of
employee’s sick leave commencement of disability. If the member is receiving
salary for sick leave for a period of more than 90 days, payment shall accrue
from the date such salary ceases. If written application for such annuity has
not been filed with the Board prior to the expiration of 90 days from the date
of disability, the annuity shall begin to accrue from the date the application
is filed, but not prior to the expiration of employee’s sick leave from the
date of disability, nor in any event prior to the time when salary payments to
the employee ceased.
   (D)   Certification of disability.
      (1)   A member shall be considered totally and permanently disabled after
the Board has received written certification by at least two licensed and
practicing physicians selected by the Board that the member is totally and
permanently disabled.
      (2)   The written certification shall state that the member has been
separated from the service of the city because of total disability of such
nature as to reasonably prevent further service for the employer, and as a
consequence is not entitled to compensation from the city.
      (3)   The Board shall grant a disability retirement annuity to the member
upon presentation of the required written certifications.
(1984 Code, § 34.65) (Ord. O-39-64, passed 7-23-1964; Ord. O-15-80, passed 2-
19-1980)
§ 34.51 RETIREMENT BENEFITS.
   (A)   Retirement annuity; requirements. Any member may, at his or her
option, retire on a service retirement annuity on or after attainment of the
age of 48 years; provided, he or she shall have completed at least ten years of
total service; provided, however, that, if a member is laid off or his or her
job is eliminated before he or she reaches the age of 48, he or she shall be
entitled to retire on a service retirement annuity before the age of 48, if he
or she has complied with all other terms required to qualify for retirement.
Upon fulfillment of these terms, the Board shall grant the retirement annuity
upon receipt of the application of the member.
   (B)   Retirement before age 48; option to acceptance of annuity. Any member
who withdraws from service prior to age 48 years after having completed at
least ten years of total service, and who does not accept a refund of
contributions, shall receive, upon application, a certificate entitling him or
her to a service-retirement annuity upon his or her attainment of age 48, or
upon total disability as set forth in §
34.50(B) of this chapter, specifying the amount of the annuity earned and
accrued at the date of withdrawal from service.
   (C)   Compulsory retirement. Each member is subject to compulsory retirement
according to the rules of the city; provided that, any member able to perform
his or her assigned duties shall not be precluded from serving at least ten
years.
   (D)   Calculation of annuity rate. The rate of retirement annuity is 2.5% of
the average salary of the employee for each year of total service for the first
20 years, 2% of the average salary for each year of total service for five
years after the first 20 years, and 1% of the average salary for each year of
total service after 25 years, subject to a maximum of 65% of average salary.
Fractional periods of service shall be considered in the calculation of such
annuities according to the above rate.
   (E)   Pension plan.
      (1)   The pension plan established by Ord. O-39-64, as amended, is hereby
frozen effective 4-1-1977 to participation by those existing city employees who
are then participating therein and who filed with the City Clerk on or before
4-30-1977, a written election to continue participating therein in lieu of
participating in CERS.
      (2)   The city elects to participate in CERS effective 4-1-1977, and
authorizes the Mayor and City Manager to execute the appropriate instruments to
effectuate such election.
      (3)   Any employee now participating in the existing city pension plan is
authorized to terminate such participation and transfer to CERS.
      (4)   The city shall continue to fund and manage its existing pension
plan for the benefit of the employees electing to continue therein.
      (5)   Employees hired after 3-31-1977, who are otherwise eligible to
participate in the city’s Pension Plan, shall participate only in CERS;
provided that, city employees hired after 3-31-1977, shall not be eligible to
participate in CERS until they have been employed continuously for 180 days.
      (6)   Excluded from participating in CERS as authorized by KRS 78.530 are
the employees of the Municipal Housing Authority and those other city employees
who are hired as temporary, part-time, seasonal and emergency workers, as
defined in KRS 78.510 through 78.990.
      (7)   The city adopts terms and provisions of CERS under KRS 78.510
through 78.990 and elects the Regular Participation Plan, beginning 4-1-1977.
   (F)   Cost of living increase.
      (1)   A cost of living increase based on the “All Items Index” of the
United States Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index may be granted by the
Board of Trustees so long as the increase may be supported on an actuarially
sound basis by the Fund.
      (2)   No increase shall exceed 5% or the actual increase in the cost of
living whichever is lower.
(1984 Code, § 34.66) (Ord. O-39-64, passed 7-23-1964; Ord. O-48-71, passed 8-
26-1971; Ord. O-15-80, passed 2-19-1980; Ord. O-16-84, passed 3-13-1984; Ord.
O-45-94, passed 12-13-1994; Ord. O-72-95, passed 12-28-1995; Ord. O-50-00,
passed 9-19-2000)
§ 34.52 INSURANCE BENEFITS.
   Effective 8-1-1990, any member of the Employees’ Retirement Fund of the city
who retires after 7-31-1988, and who is eligible for a retirement annuity, is
eligible for participation in the same city medical insurance program available
to employees, under the following terms and conditions.
   (A)   The member must submit a written request for inclusion in the medical
insurance plan.
   (B)   (1)   The city will pay 80% of a single policy premium with the total
annual payment not to exceed $1,200 per year, and the member must agree to pay
the balance of the single premium and all costs connected with family coverage
premiums.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (B)(1) above, as an
inducement to encourage retirement of the remaining employees covered by the
fund, the city will provide a single health insurance policy for any current
employee who is a member and who retires by 7-31-2011.
   (C)   The retiree medical coverage shall continue until and not extend
beyond the retiree’s sixty-fifth birthday or the date of retiree’s eligibility
for federal Medicare coverage, unless the Medicare coverage is the result of an
occupational disability, or the date that the retiree becomes eligible for
another employer sponsored plan, whichever date first occurs. Another employer
sponsored plan does not include coverage by the retiree’s spouse’s plan.
   (D)   If the retiree withdraws from the medical insurance plan in order to
enroll with another employer-sponsored plan, and that coverage is subsequently
terminated, the retiree may re-enroll in the city sponsored plan if all other
conditions of eligibility are still in effect.
   (E)   If the city’s medical insurance plan is terminated, then the retiree’s
medical coverage shall also be terminated. This plan may be terminated at the
discretion of the Board of Commissioners based on budgetary reasons or for any
other purpose that is in the best interest of the city. This medical insurance
coverage does not include dental insurance or life insurance.
   (F)   This medical insurance is not available to members of the CERS
Retirement Fund or the Police and Firefighters Retirement Fund.
   (G)   The medical benefits and insurance coverage shall be the same benefits
as that offered to active non-uniform city employees, and these benefits may be
changed from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Commissioners.
(1984 Code, § 34.67) (Ord. O-30-90, passed 7-10-1990; Ord. O-3-94, passed 2-1-
1994; Ord. O-61-98, passed 11-23-1999; Ord. O-11-11, passed 6-28-2011)
§ 34.53 MILITARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
   Any full-time employee who is a member of the National Guard or a military
reservist who is called to active military duty, in addition to the rights
guaranteed by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of
1994 (USERRA, Pub. L. 103-353) being 38 U.S.C. §§ 4301 - 4335), will also be
entitled to receive compensation during his or her active duty status in an
amount equal to a difference between his or her current pay or salary at the
time of deployment and his or her salary received from the military while on
active duty.
   (A)   CURRENT SALARY is defined to be the base salary established by the
city’s salary ordinance and any subsequent order/resolutions changing the
salary in effect on the employee’s beginning date of active military duty. The
base salary does not include overtime or any other salary benefit.
   (B)   The city will compensate the employee while the employee is on active
military duty at the difference between the employee’s salary and the
compensation received by the employee from his or her military employer. The
city will pay the difference only if the city salary is less than the military
salary.
   (C)   It is the responsibility of the employee on active duty to provide
written verification of his or her military earnings by submitting copies of
pay vouchers or other similar evidence to the Finance Department before salary
differential payments are made.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 35.001 SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAM.
   (A)   In order to provide for a joint and cooperative program for self-
insurance, the city has adopted Ord. O-36-87, passed 6-23-1987, and Ord. O-19-
93, passed 5-18-1993.
   (B)   All agreements, articles and by-laws pertaining to self-insurance and
specifically authorized by Ord. O-36-87 and Ord. O-19-93 are hereby adopted by
reference as if fully set out herein.
(1984 Code, § 35.01) (Ord. O-36-87, passed 6-23-1987; Ord. O-19-93, passed 5-
18-1993)
§ 35.002 INVESTMENT POOL PLUS.
   Whereas, the city has determined that participation in the cash management
and investment program known as the “Kentucky League of Cities Investment Pool
Plus”, for the purpose of the joint investment of moneys with other local
governments, will result in economies of scale that should enhance the
investment earnings accruing to the city while preserving the principal of the
city’s investment; therefore:
   (A)   The interlocal cooperation agreement and the declaration of trust as
described in the information statement and on file in the office of the
Secretary of state, are hereby adopted and approved. The Mayor is hereby
authorized to execute and deliver the interlocal cooperation agreement and
otherwise to evidence the city’s approval and participation in the program
including the execution and delivery of all documents and the taking of other
actions as may be necessary or appropriate. Further, the City Clerk is hereby
authorized to attest such signature and to sign such documents and take such
actions as the Mayor shall direct, their respective signatures to constitute
conclusive evidence of their approval of the documents they sign; and
   (B)   The City Manager and Finance Director are hereby designated as
“authorized officials” with authority to effectuate the investment and
withdrawal of moneys from time to time in accordance with the declaration of
trust. The Mayor shall advise the Fund of any changes in authorized officials
in accordance with procedures established by the Fund.

§ 35.003 CLAIMS AGAINST THE CITY AND DENIAL OF BENEFITS TO THOSE DELINQUENT.
   (A)   The city will not provide loans, grants, financial assistance or other
benefits such as licenses and permits to persons or entities who have filed
pending adverse claims against the city in the form of settlement demands or
lawsuits, or those who owe delinquent taxes, or are delinquent in obligations
to pay loans, fines, liens or other obligations. No person or entity will be
denied federal public or assisted housing agency benefits or programs
administered by the city as a result of this policy.
   (B)   The Board of Commissioners may waive this requirement in cases of
health, safety or other emergency considerations. The order waiving the

§ 35.078 COMPETITIVE SEALED BIDS – INVITATIONS FOR BIDS (IFB).
   The following procedures shall apply to competitive sealed bids, commonly
referred to as an invitation for bids (IFB).
   (A)   Advertising.
      (1)   All sealed bids shall be advertised not less than seven days prior
to the date advertised as the opening for bids.
      (2)   The date the advertisement is published shall not be counted as
advertising time in the seven- day calculation.
      (3)   Advertisements shall be made in the legal notices section of the
local newspaper when the funding source or contract requires. Otherwise,
advertisement on the internet, primarily publication to the city’s website,
shall be deemed a sufficient manner of notification.
      (4)   All IFBs shall be reviewed by the Finance Department and the City
Solicitor’s office prior to advertising. City staff shall provide a minimum of
one week for review.
      (5)   An extension of a bid opening date or any revision to a bid may be
provided through written addendum, as determined by the City Manager, or his or
her designee, and issued in the same manner of the original solicitation.
      (6)   An IFB may be rescinded at any time by the city before the time
when bids are scheduled to be publicly opened, if it is determined to be in the
best interest of the city.
   (B)   Specifications.
      (1)   The city shall use specifications which assure the maximum
practicable competition to meet the agency’s needs.
      (2)   The city shall ensure that every IFB provides that an item equal to
that named or described in the specifications may be furnished. The
specifications may identify a sole brand in cases where, in the written opinion
of the City Manager, documented unique and valid conditions require
compatibility, continuity or conformity with established standards. An item
shall be considered equal to the item named or described if, in the opinion of
the owner and the design professional responsible for the specifications:
         (a)   It is at least equal in quality, durability, strength, design
and other criteria deemed appropriate;
         (b)   It will perform at least equally the function imposed by the
general design for the public work being contracted for or the material being
purchased; and
      (c)   It conforms substantially to the detailed requirements for the item
in the specifications.
      (3)   A specification which describes a product which is proprietary to
one company may be used only when no other kind of specification is reasonably
available to describe requirements.
   (C)   Use of bid price or evaluated bid price.
      (1)   The bid shall be awarded to the responsible bidder who submits the
responsive bid for the lowest bid price or lowest evaluated bid price, with the
consideration of the preference for resident bidders as required by KRS
45A.494.
      (2)   If the bid is to be awarded on the basis of lowest bid price, the
method of award shall be clearly stated in the IFB.
      (3)   If the bid is to be awarded on the basis of lowest evaluated bid
price, the objectively measurable evaluation criteria to be used, along with
applicable formulas or computation methods shall be clearly stated in the IFB.
   (D)   Withdrawal of bids. Bids, once submitted, may be withdrawn before the
time set for bid opening has lapsed by submitting a request for withdrawal in
writing to the City Manager at least 24 hours before the date and time set for
opening. No bid may be withdrawn after the bid opening date.
   (E)   Waiver of irregularities. The City Manager reserves the right to waive
any informalities and nonconformance of any one or series of bids, which is
deemed immaterial and does not prejudice other bidders. The discretion of
waiver is vested in the City Manager; waiver is permissible when determined by
the City Manager to be in the best interest of the city.
   (F)   Opening time for bids.
      (1)   An opening time for each bid shall be stated in the advertisement
of the IFB.
      (2)   It shall be the bidder’s responsibility to assure that his or her
bid is in the office before the time set for bid opening.
      (3)   The City Clerk, or his or her designee, shall at the time set for
opening bids declare bids to be closed, and shall publicly open all bids
submitted. Each bid, together with the name of the bidder, shall be recorded
and be open to public inspection. Electronic bid opening and posting of the
required information for public viewing shall satisfy the requirements of this
division (F).
   (G)   Evaluation and awards.
      (1)   After bids are opened, they shall be reviewed for compliance with
specifications, terms and conditions by the City Manager, or his or her
designee.
      (2)   Once evaluated, a recommendation for acceptance of a bid, or
multiple bids, will be prepared by the City Manager, or his or her designee,
who will present the recommendation to the Board of Commissioners.
      (3)   After a reasonable evaluation, a contract shall be awarded to the
responsive and responsible bidder whose bid is either the lowest bid price or
the lowest evaluated bid price, as designated in the IFB as the basis for award
of the contract.
      (4)   If the City Manager determines, in writing, that no satisfactory
bid has been received, all bids may be rejected and new bids may be invited on
the basis of the same or revised specifications. The basis for rejection of all
bids and any subsequent action taken with respect to the IFB shall be recorded
in writing and maintained in the procurement file relating to the particular
procurement.
(1984 Code, § 35.68) (Ord. O-24-19, passed 7-23-2019)
§ 35.079 COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATION – REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).
   (A)   Competitive negotiations. Competitive negotiations, commonly referred
to as a request for proposals (RFP), may be used for a procurement when it is
determined in writing by the City Manager, or his or her designee, that:
      (1)   Specifications cannot be made sufficiently specific to permit award
on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated bid price,
including, but not limited to, contracts for experimental or developmental
research work, or highly complex equipment which requires technical
discussions, and other nonstandard supplies, services or construction;
      (2)   Sealed bidding is inappropriate because the available sources of
supply are limited, the time and place of performance cannot be determined in
advance, the price is regulated by law, or a fixed price contract is not
applicable; or
      (3)   The bid prices received through sealed bidding are unresponsive or
unreasonable as to all or part of the requirements, or are identical or appear
to have been the result of collusion; provided each responsible bidder is
notified of the intention to negotiate and is given a reasonable opportunity to
negotiate, and the negotiated price is lower than the lowest rejected bid by
any responsible bidder.
   (B)   Advertising. All RFPs shall be advertised in the same manner as sealed
bids as detailed in §
35.078(A) of this subchapter.
   (C)   Specifications. All RFPs shall include specifications that
substantially adhere to the requirements of §
35.078(B) of this subchapter, most notably that specifications should be
written in a manner which encourages the maximum amount of competition
practicable.
   (D)   Withdrawal of proposals. Proposals, once submitted, may be withdrawn
before the time set for opening as stated in the RFP has lapsed, by submitting
a request for withdrawal in writing to the City Manager at least 24 hours
before the date and time set for opening. No proposal may be withdrawn after
the bid opening date.
   (E)   Waiver of irregularities. The City Manager reserves the right to waive
any informalities and nonconformance of any one or series of proposals, which
is deemed immaterial and does not prejudice other offerors. The discretion of
waiver is vested in the City Manager; waiver is permissible when determined by
the City Manager to be in the best interest of the city.
   (F)   Opening time for proposals.
      (1)   All submitted proposals received by the city in response to a RFP
shall be kept secure and unopened until the date and time set for final
submission.
      (2)   All RFPs shall include detailed final submission instructions.
Respondents shall be responsible for submitting their responses in a timely
manner and in accordance with submission requirements outlined in the request.
Proposals shall not be opened or read publicly.
      (3)   Proposals shall not be eligible to be examined, inspected or
reviewed by persons of the public until all submissions have been opened,
reviewed and awarded or cancelled entirely.
   (G)   Evaluation of proposals.
      (1)   All RFPs shall indicate the factors to be considered in the
evaluation of the request, including the reciprocal preference for resident
bidders required by KRS 45A.494, and the relative importance of each factor;
and the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is used in the
procurement.
      (2)   The City Manager, or his or her designee, shall examine each
written proposal received for general compliance and shall provide a scored
evaluation of each response. The City Manager may elect additional individuals
to review and score received proposals.
      (3)   The City Manager, or his or her designee, shall determine in
writing based upon individual review, those proposals received from responsible
offerors that are reasonably susceptible of being selected for award.
      (4)   Written or oral discussions shall be conducted with all responsible
offerors who submit proposals determined in writing to be reasonably
susceptible of being selected for award. Discussions shall not disclose any
information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. Discussions
need not be conducted:
         (a)   With respect to prices, where such prices are fixed by law,
regulation or reverse auction, except that consideration shall be given to
competitive terms and conditions;
         (b)   Where the time of delivery or performance will not permit
discussions; or
         (c)   Where it can be clearly demonstrated and documented from the
existence of adequate competition or accurate prior cost experience that
acceptance of an initial offer without discussion would result in fair and
reasonable prices.
      (5)   Discussions with offerors may be held privately, formally,
informally, orally or in writing, or in any combination thereof, as determined
by the City Manager to be in a manner most advantageous to the city.
      (6)   If, after discussion with offerors have concluded, it is determined
that no acceptable proposal has been submitted, all proposals may be rejected
and, in the discretion of the City Manager, new proposals may be requested on
the basis of the same or revised terms, or the procurement may be abandoned.
   (H)   Awards. Awards shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal
is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city based upon the
evaluation factors set forth in the RFP and the reciprocal preference for
resident bidders required by KRS 45A.494.

§ 35.080 MULTIPLE AND PARTIAL AWARDS.
   (A)   Multiple or partial contracts may be awarded from a public
solicitation when the scope of work permits services or goods to be parceled in
a manner that would not create a disruption to the quality of services or the
efficiency of the work.
   (B)   The City Manager reserves the right to award multiple or partial
contracts for any public solicitation when that decision is made in the best
interest of the city.

   (A)   Findings.
      (1)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
      (2)   The vitality and stability of the government of the city depends
upon the public’s confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed
officers and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the
private interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that
confidence is imperiled.
      (3)   The government of the city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
   (B)   Purpose and authority.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring
that standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for
officers and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in
their application and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of
the city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
      (2)   For guidance as to the interpretation and application of these
standards parties may refer to the various comments contained in the KLC Model
Code of Ethics (January 2017). Another source of guidance is Local Government
Ethics Programs in a Nutshell by Robert Wechsler found at:
http://www.cityethics.org/publications/LGEP-Nutshell
      (3)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements
of KRS 65.003 as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   Statutory authorization. This chapter is enacted under the power
vested in the city by KRS 82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

In addition, the statute also states that the following city and consolidated
local government offices are incompatible with any other public office:
      (1)   Member of the legislative body of cities of the first class;
      (2)   Mayor and member of the legislative council of a consolidated local
government; and
      (3)   Mayor and member of the legislative body in cities of the home rule
class.
   (C)   In addition to the Constitution and statutory provisions, there are
common law incompatibilities that have been defined by the courts. City
officers and employment positions are deemed incompatible when one office or
position of employment was inherently inconsistent in function with the other
when there arises an implication that the duties and responsibilities of both
cannot be performed at the same time with a necessary degree of impartiality
and honesty.
   (D)   KRS 61.090 provides that the acceptance of an incompatible office
operates to vacate the first office.

if the withdrawal occurs at a public meeting, or leave the room if it is a
legally conducted closed meeting (“executive session”) under KRS 61.810 and
61.815.
   (B)   Withdrawal at a meeting requires the public announcement, on the
record, of the reason for withdrawal.
   (C)   An officer or employee whose outside employment or other outside
activity or relationship can reasonably be expected to require more than
sporadic withdrawal must resign or cease such outside employment or activity.
An officer or employee should not begin employment or an activity or
relationship that can reasonably be expected to require more than sporadic
withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is in such a situation, he or
she should not accept the position with the city.
   (D)   (1)   If an officer or appointed board member is requested to withdraw
from participation in a matter, for the reason that he or she has a conflict of

         (c)   Anyone else who may be affected by a decision relating to this

The Board shall forward within ten working days to each officer or employee of
the city or city agency who is the subject of the complaint a copy of the

   (B)   The Board of Ethics may, on its own initiative, determine through an
inquiry into informal allegations or information provided directly to the
Board, by referral, in the public news media, or otherwise, that a violation of
this code may exist and prepare a complaint of its own. The Board of Ethics may
also amend a complaint that has been filed with it by adding further
allegations, by adding respondents involved in the same conduct, directly or
indirectly, by action or inaction or by deleting allegations that would not
constitute a violation of this chapter, have been made against persons or
entities not covered by this code, or do not appear to be supported by the
facts. The Board of Ethics may also consolidate complaints where the
allegations are materially related. Amended complaints must be sent to the
complainant and respondent by the Board of Ethics.
   (C)   Within 30 days of the receipt of a proper complaint, the Board of

in the complaint. The Board shall afford a person who is the subject of the
complaint an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the complaint. The
person shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to appear and be
heard under oath, and to offer evidence in response to the allegations.
   (D)   The person who is the subject of the complaint (respondent) may file
with the Board of Ethics a response to the complaint within 30 days after his
or her receipt of the complaint. The response, if any, must be sent to the
person filing the original complaint (complainant) by the Board of Ethics

within five days after its filing.
   (E)   Extensions of time to any of the time limitations specified in this
section may be granted by the Board of Ethics upon a vote of the majority of

must give written notice of any extension(s) of time to the respondent and the
complainant.

existence of a preliminary inquiry, the Board may publicly confirm the
existence of the inquiry, and, at its discretion, make public any documents
which were issued to either party.
   (G)   The Board shall make a determination based on its preliminary inquiry
whether the complaint is within its jurisdiction and, if so, whether it alleges
a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation of this chapter. If the Board
concludes that the complaint is outside of its jurisdiction, frivolous or
without factual basis, the Board shall immediately terminate the inquiry,
reduce the conclusion to writing, and transmit a copy of its decision to the
complainant and to all officers or employees against whom the complaint was
filed.
   (H)   If the Board of Ethics concludes, based upon its preliminary inquiry,
that the complaint is within its jurisdiction and contains allegations

Commission shall notify the officer or employee who is the subject of the
complaint and may initiate a hearing to determine whether there has been a
violation.

no violation.

administer oaths or affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance
and require the production of any books or records it deems relevant and
material. The Police Department and all city agencies, bodies, officials and
employees are required to respond fully and truthfully to all enquiries and
cooperate with all requests of the Board of Ethics or its agents relating to an
investigation. It is a violation of this code for any official or employee to
deny access to information requested by the Board of Ethics in the course of an
investigation or a public hearing, except to the extent that such denial is
required by federal, state or local law.

or any of its members or staff has violated any provision of this code, or any
other law, the Board of Ethics must promptly transmit to the legislative body a
copy of the complaint.
   (K)   If the Board of Ethics concludes, based upon its preliminary inquiry,
that the complaint is within its jurisdiction and contains allegations
sufficient to establish a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation, the
Board shall notify the officer or employee who is the subject of the complaint
and may:
      (1)   Due to mitigating circumstances such as, lack of significant
economic advantage or gain by the officer or employee, lack of economic loss to
the city and its taxpayers or lack of significant impact on public confidence
in city government, issue a written or verbal reprimand to the officer or
employee concerning the alleged violation. If a written reprimand is issued, a
copy shall be provided to the executive authority and governing body of the
city or city agency. If a verbal reprimand is issued, a written record of the
verbal reprimand shall be provided to the executive authority and governing
body of the city or city agency; or

   (A)   Open records rules and regulations governing access to the public
records of the city, conforming to the provisions of KRS 61.870 to 61.884 shall
be posted on the city’s website and in a prominent location in all city offices
to which the public has access and shall include the mailing address, email,
and phone number of the City Clerk or their designee as well as the
standardized form developed by the Kentucky Attorney General under KRS 61.876
(4).
   (B)   Open records that are prepared, owned, used, in the possession of or
retained by the city, and all public agencies operating under its jurisdiction,
including those that are stored offsite or managed and maintained by a private
vendor, shall be accessible to residents of the Commonwealth by means of onsite
inspection, by delivery of copies through the U.S. mail, or, if the length of

place of business, outside of the county who precisely describe the requested
records “which are readily available within the public agency” and who prepays
for copies and postage.

and their officers and employees, shall immediately locate, retrieve, and
transmit to the City Clerk all responsive records located on public or private
premises or devices for review, redaction, and disclosure or nondisclosure
based on the records’ content. Those agencies, and their officers and

legally supportable claim of exemption based on the content of the records.

of open records be mailed to the requester must contain a “precise description”
of the records, and those records must be “readily available”. The City Clerk
or the City Clerk’s designee may communicate with the requester to eliminate
any confusion or doubt as to the scope of the request, or to otherwise
facilitate access, but shall not ask the requester how the requester intends to
use the records or the purpose of the request.
   (J)   Public agencies, and officials and employees of public agencies, shall
comply with the city’s uniform open records policy in accessing public records
of the city or public agencies operating under its jurisdiction but shall,
pursuant to KRS 61.878(5) enjoy an enhanced right of access to otherwise exempt
public records if the public records are necessary in the performance of a
legitimate government function or serve a legitimate governmental need. Public
agencies, officials or employees who obtain otherwise exempt public records for
these purposes shall ensure the records are not publicly disclosed.
   (K)   No requester shall be permitted to remove original copies of city
records from city offices without the written permission of the City Clerk or
the City Clerk’s designee.

   (B)   In calculating the five-day response time, the city may exclude the
date on which the request arrived by U.S. mail, fax, hand-delivery or e-mail.
   (C)   If the public records request requires production of open records that
are “in active use, in storage, or not otherwise available”, the city shall
notify the requester, in writing and no later than the fifth business day, that
it cannot immediately produce the requested records. The phrase “not otherwise
available” has been construed by the Attorney General to include requests for
voluminous open records. The written response shall include a citation to KRS
61.872(5) and a “detailed explanation of the cause for delay”. The demands of
other public duties does not constitute a legally recognized basis for
postponing release of the records. The written response shall also state the
earliest date and time the records will be available. The written response to a
request to inspect such records shall identify the place at which the records
will be available for inspection in suitable facilities. The written response
to a request for copies of such records by mail shall state that the requester
will be notified of the actual cost of copying and postage on the same day the
records are located, retrieved, and reviewed and that the records will be
mailed upon prepayment of the copying and postage charges.
   (D)   The absence of the City Clerk or the City Clerk’s designee does not
suspend or delay the five-day deadline for final written response.
   (E)   The response shall be issued by the City Clerk or the City Clerk’s
designee, or under the Clerk’s or designee’s authority. The city shall maintain
a comprehensive open records register to track all incoming open records
requests and the disposition of those requests.
   (F)   The city’s final written response to a public records request, issued
on the fifth business day, shall notify the requester that the request will be
granted or denied. A written response to a request to conduct onsite inspection
of open records, notifying the requester that the request is granted, shall
advise the requester that the records are immediately available for inspection
during the city’s regular business hours at a specifically designated location
where suitable facilities are available.
   (G)   The city’s final written response to a request for copies of open
records by mail, notifying the requester that the request is granted, shall
advise the requester that the open records will be mailed upon receipt of
payment to “City of Covington” in a specified amount based on the actual cost
of reproduction and postage cost.
   (H)   The city’s final written denial of a request to inspect or obtain
copies of exempted public records shall advise the requester that the request
is denied, identify one or more of the statutory exemptions found at KRS 61.878
(1)(a) through (r), and provide a detailed explanation of how the exemption(s)
apply to the records, or any portion thereof withheld. The city recognizes that
it has the burden of proof in sustaining denial of an open records request in
an administrative challenge to the Kentucky Attorney General and the burden of
proof in sustaining the denial in a judicial challenge in the courts.
   (I)   The city is not, in general, required to grant a request for
information, as opposed to a request for existing public records. For example,
“What were the results of the city’s last audit” is an improper request that
the city is not obligated to grant. “Please provide
a copy of the city’s most recent audit” is a proper request that the city is
obligated to grant.
   (J)   If the requester seeks records that the city does not now have, nor
ever had, custody or control of, the city shall notify the requester of this
fact in writing. If the identity of the actual custodial agency is known, the
city shall furnish the requester with the name and location of the official
custodian of the agency’s public records. Requests made for records in
possession of the Legislative Research Commission shall be forwarded to the
director of the Legislative Research Commission within two days of the request.
   (K)   If the requester seeks city records that cannot be located, have been
prematurely destroyed through error or inadvertence, or were required by law to
be created but were never created, the city shall provide the requester with a
candid explanation for the unavailability of the records. Destruction of a
public record after a request is received is wholly impermissible and may
constitute a violation of KRS 61.991(2)(a), relating to willful concealment or
destruction of a public record and punishable as a Class A misdemeanor, or a
violation of KRS 519.060(1)(b), relating to tampering with public records and
punishable as a Class D felony.
   (L)   Records that originated in another public agency but are in the city’s
custody as a “casual possessor” must be treated as city records unless state or
federal law expressly require otherwise. The city shall respond to a request
for such records as it would respond to any other records request but may wish
to consult with the agency from which it obtained the records to ascertain if
there is a legally supportable claim for exemption that the city should assert.
   (M)   (1)   The city may deny a public records request that imposes “an
unreasonable burden in producing public records” or “repeated requests” that
the City Clerk or the City Clerk’s designee “has reason to believe are intended
to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency based upon clear and
convincing evidence” of an unreasonable burden or intent to disrupt essential
functions.
      (2)   The courts have recognized that clear and convincing evidence is a
“high proof threshold” but have not indicated what evidence meets this
threshold. The Attorney General focuses on the number of records involved, or a
good faith estimate of the number of records involved, the difficulties
associated with locating, retrieving, reviewing, and redacting the records,
whether one or more of the exemptions to public inspection require the
redaction of particular information in the records, the number of staff hours,
or a good faith estimate of the number of staff hours, required to fulfill the
request, and the approximate cost to the agency based on these factors. A
detailed description of the burden that includes this information shall be
included in any denial based on unreasonable burden. Specific proof of bad
faith, such as duplicative requests or requests that the agency grants but the
requester never picks up, shall be included in any denial based on intentional
disruption of essential agency functions. KRS 61.872(6) should only be invoked
to deny access to public records in the most extreme and flagrant cases.
   (N)   The city shall, upon payment of a reasonable fee as described in §
37.06, provide a requester with a copy of any open record it has permitted the
requester to inspect. Inspection and copying are corollary rights.

§ 37.06 COPIES OF OPEN RECORDS.
   (A)   The city shall not restrict the use of personal devices, including but
not limited to scanners, cameras, computers, and copiers, by a requester
wishing to make his or her own copy of an open record. The city may, however,
take appropriate steps to ensure that duplication by a requester will not
damage or alter the original records.
   (B)   The city shall not restrict the ability of any person to make
handwritten notes while inspecting an open record.
   (C)   The city shall provide copies of open records used for commercial or
noncommercial purposes in standard hard copy format where the city currently
maintains the records in hard copy format. The city is not required to convert
hard copy format records to electronic formats but may do so at its discretion.
If the open records are maintained in electronic format, the requester may
designate in which format, hard copy or electronic, the records shall be
reproduced.
   (D)   The city shall impose no fee for inspection of open records. Upon
inspection, the requestor shall be charged the fees described in this section
if he or she requests copies.
   (E)   The city shall notify a requester in advance if the anticipated costs
of reproduction exceed a stipulated amount or if the anticipated costs of
reproduction will exceed $25.
   (F)   The city shall not recover as part of its actual costs of reproduction
any charge assessed by a private contractor or outside entity retained to
archive, manage, recover, or retrieve city records or otherwise assist in
fulfilling a request.
   (G)   Upon agreement with the requester, the city shall arrange with an
outside contractor, at the most economical rate available, to reproduce records
which it lacks duplication equipment to reproduce itself (example: as oversized
maps, photo quality visual images) and may recover the actual charge assessed
by the outside contractor.
   (H)   Absent a statute authorizing a specific fee relating to a particular
type of record, the city shall reproduce hard copy open records requested for a
noncommercial use in a standard 8-1/2 x 11-inch format for a fee of $.10 per
page. No fee shall be imposed for staff time, including staff time expended in
retrieving, reviewing, redacting, or reproducing the record.
   (I)   The city shall provide copies of electronic records requested for
noncommercial use in the records’ native electronic format, or an electronic
format mutually agreed upon but not routinely maintained, for a fee based on
the actual cost of the medium on which the records are copied and, in the case
of a nonroutine format, any mutually agreed upon conversion costs. Records
requested in electronic format shall be provided on a CD for a fee of $.20 per
CD. The city shall impose no fee for direct electronic transmission of open
records from the city to the requester, there being no associated costs. In no
case shall the city impede access to or searchability of electronic records.
   (J)   If the city and the requester are unable to reach an agreement on an
electronic format, the city shall convert the electronic records to a flat file
electronic American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), the
standard electronic format established by KRS 61.874(2)(b). The city shall not
recover any cost associated with conversion to this format.
   (K)   The city shall reproduce open records requested for commercial use
(“any use by which the user expects a profit either through commission, salary,
or fee”) using the same factors found in divisions (H), (I) and (J) of this
section, but may, in addition, recover staff costs incurred in connection with
retrieval, review, redaction, and reproduction. The city may ask whether the
requester intends to use the open records for a commercial purpose. If the
requester confirms that the records will be used for a commercial purpose, the
city may require the requester to submit a certified statement of the
commercial purpose for which the records will be used. The city may also
require the requester to enter into a contract for the stated commercial
purpose for a specified fee. Any misrepresentation of or deviation from, the
requester’s stated commercial or noncommercial purpose may be actionable by the
city as provided in KRS 61.874(5) and 61.8745.

§ 37.07 STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Kentucky courts recognize “[t]he unambiguous purpose of the Open
Records Act, being KRS 61.870 to 61.884 is the disclosure of public records
even though such disclosure may cause inconvenience or embarrassment”, but that
“[d]espite its manifest intention to enact a disclosure statute, the General
Assembly determined that certain public records should be excluded from
disclosure” and that “[f]rom the exclusions we must conclude that with respect
to certain records, the General Assembly has determined that the public’s right
to know is subservient to statutory rights of personal privacy and the need for
governmental confidentiality”.
   (B)   To promote accountability and ensure “open, honest, transparent and
efficient government practices and policies”, the city has adopted a revised
transparency policy at §§
37.30 and
37.31 of this chapter. The revised transparency policy is intended to
facilitate streamlined access to frequently requested records that do not
compromise statutory rights of personal privacy or the need for governmental
confidentiality by posting those records on the city’s website, https://
www.covingtonky.gov for immediate access. Sections
37.30 and
37.31 of this chapter supplements, but does not supersede, modify, or limit
rights guaranteed under Kentucky’s Open Records Act, being KRS 61.870 to 61.884
and persons or entities wishing to obtain records and information identified in
the ordinance may do so by means of an open records request.
   (C)   In all other cases, the city shall exercise a presumption in favor of
openness except those in which the public’s right to know must yield to
“statutory rights of personal privacy or the need for governmental
confidentiality”.
   (D)   The General Assembly has enacted numerous statutory exemptions found
at KRS 61.878(l)(a) through(r). In interpreting and applying these exemptions,
the city shall be guided by the express language of the exemptions, case law
construing the exemptions, and administrative guidance provided by the Kentucky
Attorney General.
   (E)   The exemptions found at KRS 61.878(l)(a) through(r) shall be “strictly
construed” pursuant to the statement of legislative policy in KRS 61.871.
   (F)   Pursuant to KRS 61.878(1)(r), “[c]ommunications of a purely personal
nature unrelated to any governmental function” shall be exempt from public
access. Communications from nongovernmental employees that address campaign or
election issues, matters before the Board of Commissioners, or general city
business are not purely personal and shall be subject to disclosure.
   (G)   In the event the City Clerk or the City Clerk’s designee requires
assistance in determining whether to waive the city’s right to refuse access to
material excluded from public inspection, the City Clerk or the City Clerk’s
designee shall immediately request assistance from the Office of the City
Solicitor. If the Office of City Solicitor requires assistance in determining
whether to waive the city’s right to refuse access to material excluded from
public inspection, that office shall immediately request assistance from the
City Manager. If the City Manager requires assistance in determining whether to
waive the city’s right to refuse access to material excluded from public
inspection, the City Manager shall immediately request assistance from the
Board of Commissioners who shall make the determination, notify the City Clerk
or the City Clerk’s designee, and direct issuance of a final response.
   (H)   In accordance with applicable state law, the city shall not attempt to
avoid responding to a lawful open records request submitted by a party involved
in litigation, when the requested documents could be obtained through an
applicable provision in the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (I)   The city shall not, by ordinance, order, contract or other formal or
informal action, attempt to restrict access to, offer assurances of
confidentiality for, or promise to withhold, public records that are not
already exempt under one or more exemption codified at KRS 61.878(l)(a) through
(r).
   (J)   A city employee, or applicant for employment, is entitled to inspect
and obtain copies of any records that relate to the employee or applicant, even
if the records are statutorily exempt, unless the employee is under criminal or
administrative investigation or requests a copy of an examination that will be
given again. The city employee, or applicant for employment, shall comply with
the city’s uniform open records policy in accessing public records of the city
or public agencies operating under its jurisdiction.
   (K)   The city shall not withhold statistical information not descriptive of
any readily identifiable person. The city is not, however, obligated to compile
statistics that do not already exist to fulfill an open records request.
   (L)   If a requested public record contains both exempt and nonexempt
information, the city shall separate the exempted information and make the
nonexempt information available. The city shall identify the exemption relied
upon in withholding exempted information in its final written response to the
request and provide a detailed explanation of how the exemption applies to the
information withheld.
   (M)   Although access to body worn camera recordings shall be governed by
KRS 61.870 to 61.884, as well as the retention requirement set forth in the
Local Government General Records Schedule, Records Series 6707, KRS 61.168
identifies 14 exceptions to the general rule of openness that the city may, in
its discretion, invoke to limit access unless certain conditions, identified at
KRS 61.168(5), are met.
   (N)   Public agencies, and officials and employees of public agencies, shall
comply with the city’s uniform open records policy in accessing public records
of the city or public agencies operating under its jurisdiction, but shall
enjoy an enhanced right of access to otherwise exempt public records if the
public records are necessary in the performance of a legitimate government
function or serve a legitimate governmental need. Public agencies, officials or
employees who obtain otherwise exempt public records for these purposes shall
ensure the records are not publicly disclosed.
   (O)   To the extent feasible, the city shall notify a person or persons
affected by disclosure of records containing personal information that a
request for records relating to the person(s) has been received and that the
city intends to release the records two weeks from the date of notification.
Such a person(s) has standing to bring an action against the city in Circuit
Court to prevent disclosure of the records if the Court finds that disclosure
of the personal information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy. The city shall agree to postpone final action on the request
for two weeks, and afford the person(s) an opportunity to review the records in
that period, but if no action has been initiated after two weeks, the city
shall release the records.

   Similar provisions, see KRS 61.878(2), (3),(4)
§ 37.08 OPEN RECORDS DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   (A)   A requester who is dissatisfied with the city’s handling of an open
records request may appeal the city’s response to the Kentucky Attorney General
or to the Kenton County Circuit Court.
   (B)   An inmate confined in a correctional facility must appeal to the
Attorney General before appealing to the courts pursuant to KRS 197.025(3) and
must do so within 20 days of the city’s denial of a request. All other
requesters may bypass the Attorney General and initiate an appeal in the
Circuit Court, and there is no time limitation on when the requesters must
initiate an appeal.
   (C)   Pursuant to KRS 61.880(2)(c), the city has the burden of sustaining
its action in an appeal to the Attorney General. Pursuant to KRS 61.882(3), the
city has the burden of proof in an appeal to the Circuit Court. The city “bears
the burden of proof. . . and what it must prove is that any decision to
withhold responsive records was justified under the Act.”
   (D)   Notification of receipt of an open records appeal, and the letter of
appeal, shall be immediately directed to the City Clerk or the City Clerk’s
designee, and a copy immediately forwarded to the city’s Legal Department.
   (E)   In an appeal to the Kentucky Attorney General, the city may supplement
its denial, or otherwise explain its actions, in writing, and shall provide the
appellant with a copy of its written supplemental response. The city shall
comply with the Attorney General’s request for additional documentation, and
shall provide the appellant with a copy of its written response. If the
Attorney General requests a copy of the public records in dispute, the city
shall comply with the request but shall not provide the appellant with a copy
of the disputed records.
   (F)   An open records decision issued by the Kentucky Attorney General
pursuant to KRS 61.880(2) shall have the force and effect of law if not
appealed to the Kenton County Circuit Court within 30 days.
   (G)   If the city receives an unfavorable ruling from the Attorney General,
the city shall, within the 30-day period, determine whether to comply with the
decision by releasing the previously disputed records or taking appropriate
corrective measures, or to seek judicial review of the adverse open records
decision. In no case shall the city ignore an adverse open records decision
beyond 30 days and force the requester/appellant to petition the Kenton County
Circuit Court to enforce the legally binding open records decision.

DOCUMENT RETENTION POLICY
§ 37.20 RECORDS MANAGEMENT AND RETENTION.
   (A)   KRS 61.8715 recognizes “an essential relationship” between the intent
of KRS Ch. 61, relating to open records, and the intent of KRS Ch. 171,
relating to records management and the role of the Kentucky Department for
Libraries and Archives (KDLA), declaring that in order “to ensure the efficient
administration of government and to provide accountability of government
activities, public agencies are required to manage and maintain their records
according to the requirements of these statutes.” The city recognizes that
proper records management facilitates records access.
   (B)   The city shall ensure that records containing adequate and proper
documentation of its organizational functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
and essential transactions are created and preserved, including records
containing information necessary to protect the city’s legal and financial
rights and the legal and financial rights of persons directly affected by the
city’s activities.
   (C)   The city shall establish an active, continuing program for the
economical and efficient management of its records that includes effective
controls over the creation, maintenance, and disposition of those records. The
city recognizes that records retention schedules, which govern records
retention and disposition, are a key component of this program.
   (D)   The city shall rely on the local government general records schedule
and the municipal government records schedule for all questions concerning
records management, retention, and disposition. These schedules, adopted in
regulation at 725 KAR 1:061, provide legal authority for the destruction of
city records that have met their retention period. The city shall employ
procedures governing proper destruction of city records set forth in
Destruction of Public Records: A Procedural Guide.
   (E)   City records retained beyond their authorized retention period may be
subject to public disclosure upon request, even if the records retention was
not required under the retention schedule.
   (F)   The city shall not destroy a record that has met its retention period,
but not yet been destroyed, if the record is the subject of, or relates to,
active or pending litigation, audit, open records request, or appeal of an open
records decision.
   (G)   An unscheduled city record that does not appear on either the local
government general records schedule of the municipal government records
schedule shall be retained as a permanent record until it is properly
scheduled.
   (H)   The city shall ensure that it retains control of any and all public
records that are stored offsite or whose management and retention is
outsourced, and that the records are immediately accessible for production in
response to an open records request.
   (I)   The city shall maintain records in hard copy or electronic format
based on the content of the records not the records’ format. For example,
correspondence may be transmitted electronically, by email, or by traditional
means, on paper. If the correspondence documents the city’s major activities,
functions and programs and the important events in its history, it is official
correspondence and shall be retained permanently. If the correspondence is not
crucial to the preservation of the city’s administrative history, is generally
of a non-policy nature and without permanent value, and deals only with the
city’s general operations, it is routine correspondence and shall be retained
for two years after which it can be destroyed. If the correspondence is not
related to city business in any way and consists of messages of a purely
personal nature, spam, and other unsolicited correspondence, it is nonbusiness
related correspondence and shall be destroyed or deleted upon receipt or as
soon as possible thereafter.
   (J)   All city officers and employees are responsible for maintaining the
integrity of records regardless of whether those records are stored
electronically or in hard copy. City records in the officer’s or employee’s
custody and control must be properly managed, retained, and accessible until
all legal, fiscal, and administrative retention periods have been met,
regardless of the record’s format.
   (K)   Communications conducted on email accounts issued by the city to city
officials and employees shall be restricted to city business and are
presumptively public records. Whether the public records are subject to public
inspection and therefore open records depends on the content of the
communication and the strict application of one or more of the 16 statutory
exemptions found at KRS 61.878(1)(a) through (p). City issued email accounts
may be subject to search.
   (L)   City officials and employees shall use city issued email accounts in
all matters relating to city business. If personal email accounts must be used,
the city official or employee shall send a copy of the communication to the
city official’s or employee’s city email account and forward any received
message relating to city business to the city official’s or employee’s city
email account.
   (M)   Records retention schedules and management practices apply equally to
all city records regardless of whether the records originate or are stored on a
publicly-issued electronic device or on public premises.
   (N)   The city shall strictly adhere to records management and retention
requirements established in KRS 171.410 et seq., and best practices as
delineated in Managing Government Records: A Cooperative Undertaking, published
by KDLA, and the guidance documents referenced therein.

§ 40.01 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   One of the keys to sound financial management is the development of a
debt policy. This need is recognized by bond rating agencies and development of
a debt policy is a recommended practice by the Government Finance Officers
Association. A debt policy sets forth the parameters for issuing debt and
managing outstanding debt and provides guidance to decision makers regarding
the timing and purposes for which debt may be issued, types and amounts of
permissible debt, method of sale that may be used and structural features that
may be incorporated. The debt policy should recognize a binding commitment to
full and timely repayment of all debt as an intrinsic requirement for entry
into the capital markets. The debt policy ensures that the city maintains a
sound debt position and that its credit quality is protected. Adherence to a
debt management policy signals to the rating agencies and the capital markets
that the city is well-managed and should be able to meet its obligations in a
timely manner. Adherence to this policy will help assure the city’s credit
ratings.
   (B)   The city recognizes that a fiscally prudent debt policy is required
to:
      (1)   Maintain the city’s sound financial position;
      (2)   Ensure the city has the flexibility to respond to changes in future
service priorities, revenue levels and operating expenses;
      (3)   Protect the city’s creditworthiness:
      (4)   Ensure that all debt is structured to protect both current and
future taxpayers, ratepayers and citizens of the city; and
      (5)   Ensure that the city’s debt is consistent with the city’s planning
goals, objectives, capital improvement program and/or budget.
   (C)   Advantages of a debt policy are as follows:
      (1)   Enhances the quality of decisions by imposing order and discipline,
and promoting consistency and continuity in decision making;
      (2)   Provides rationality in the decision- making process;
      (3)   Identifies objectives for staff to implement;
      (4)   Demonstrates a commitment to long- term financial planning
objectives; and
      (5)   Is regarded positively by the rating agencies in reviewing credit
quality.

§ 40.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADVANCE REFUNDING. A refinancing transaction in which new (refunding) bonds
are issued to repay (refund) outstanding bonds prior to the first call date.
The proceeds of the refunding bonds are deposited in an escrow account,
invested in government securities and used to pay debt service (interest,
principal and premium, if any) on the refunded bonds through the applicable
call date.
   ARBITRAGE. The difference between the interest paid on the tax-exempt
securities and the interest earned by investing the proceeds in higher-yielding
taxable securities. IRS regulations govern arbitrage on the proceeds from
issuance of municipal securities.
   BOND ANTICIPATION NOTES (BANs). Notes which are paid from the proceeds of
the issuance of long-term bonds. Typically issued for capital projects.
   CALL PROVISIONS. The terms of the bond giving the issuer the right to redeem
all or a portion of a bond prior to its stated date of maturity at a specific
price, usually at or above par.
   CAPITALIZED INTEREST. A portion of the proceeds of a bond issue which is set
aside to pay interest on the same bond issue for a specific period of time.
Interest is commonly capitalized for the construction period of the project.
   CAPITAL LEASE. A lease obligation that has met the criteria to be
categorized as a capital lease as opposed to an operating lease under generally
accepted accounting principles.
   COMPETITIVE SALE. A sale/auction of securities by an issuer in which
underwriters or syndicate of underwriters submit sealed bids to purchase the
securities.
   CONTINUING DISCLOSURE. The principle that accurate and complete information
material to the transaction which potential investors would be likely to
consider material in making investment decisions with respect to the
securities, be made available on an ongoing basis.
   DEBT. An amount of money borrowed by one party, the borrower or debtor, to a
second party, the lender or creditor.
   DEBT SERVICE RESERVE FUND. The fund in which moneys are placed which may be
used to pay debt service if pledged revenues are insufficient to satisfy the
debt service requirements.
   DESIGNATION POLICIES. A policy or policies that outline how an investor’s
order is filled when a maturity is oversubscribed when there is an underwriting
syndicate. The senior managing underwriter and issuer decide how the bonds will
be allocated among the syndicate. There are three primary classifications of
orders which form the designation policy: group net orders; net designated
orders and member orders.
   ESCROW. A fund established to hold moneys pledged and to be used to pay debt
service on an outstanding issue.
   EXPENSES. Compensates senior managers for out-of-pocket expenses including
underwriter’s counsel, PTC charges, travel, syndicate expenses, dealer fees,
overtime expenses, communication expenses, computer time and postage.
   GENERAL OBLIGATION (GO) BONDS. Bonds issued and secured by the city’s pledge
of its full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power.
   INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY. Equity or fairness principle that those that
benefit from a capital improvement should pay for it.
   LEGAL DEBT MARGIN. The amount of GO bonds and certain other interest-bearing
obligations (other than revenue bonds) that the city may have outstanding
expressed as a percentage of the assessed value of real property in the city as
shown on the last preceding assessment for taxes.
   NEGOTIATED SALE. A method of sale in which the issuer chooses one
underwriter to negotiate terms pursuant to which such underwriter will purchase
and market the bonds.
   OPTION VALUE. Option valuation is a methodology for evaluating the
efficiency of a refunding. Option valuation calculates the maximum theoretical
value of refunding a bond, then expresses the current refunding savings as a
percentage of the maximum theoretical savings.
   PAY-AS-YOU-GO. An issuer elects to finance a project with existing cash flow
as opposed to issuing debt obligations.
   PRESENT VALUE. The current value of a future cash flow.
   PRIVATE PLACEMENT. The original placement of an issue with one or more
investors as opposed to being publicly offered or sold.
   REBATE. A requirement imposed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 whereby the
issuer of tax-exempt bonds must pay the IRS an amount equal to its profit
earned from investment of tax-exempt bond proceeds at rates exceeding the tax-
exempt borrowing rate. The tax-exempt borrowing rate (or “bond yield”) is
calculated pursuant to the IRS code together with all income earned on the
accumulated profit pending payment.
   REFUNDING. A transaction in which the city refinances an outstanding issue
by issuing new (refunding) bonds and using the proceeds to immediately retire
the old (refunded) bonds.
   REVENUE BONDS. Bonds issued by the city secured by a specific revenue pledge
of rates, rents or fees.
   TAX-SUPPORTED DEBT. Debt that is expected to be repaid from the general fund
tax revenues of the city. This includes GO bonds, appropriation-supported
bonds, capital leases and in certain circumstances moral obligation bonds. For
the purpose of this debt policy, net tax-supported debt includes GO debt for
the city, certain bonded capital leases, and any moral obligation bonds for
which the city has deposited funds to a debt service reserve fund as requested
to replenish such reserve fund.
   UNDERWRITER. A dealer that purchases new issues of municipal securities from
the issuer and resells them to investors.
   UNDERWRITER’S DISCOUNT. The difference between the price at which bonds are
bought by the underwriter from the issuer and the price at which they are
reoffered to investors.
(1984 Code, § 40.02) (Ord. O-07-19, passed 3-26-2019)
§ 40.03 GUIDELINES FOR DEBT ISSUANCE.
   (A)   The city will prepare and update annually a five-year capital
improvement program (CIP) to be approved by City Commission. The CIP will be
developed with an analysis of the city’s infrastructure and other capital
needs, and the financial impact of the debt service required to meet the
recommended financing plan. The city will strive to fund at least 10% of the
CIP projects’ aggregate cost on a cash basis.
   (B)   Each project proposed for financing through debt issuance will have an
analysis performed for review of tax impact and future operating costs
associated with the project and related debt issuance costs.
   (C)   All proceeds from city issued debt shall be appropriated by the Board
of Commissioners.
   (D)   Proceeds from the issuance of debt shall be monitored with regard to
federal arbitrage restrictions. Compliance with all applicable federal tax
requirements shall be adhered to. The city will coordinate expected project
funds payout so as to maximize investment earnings in light of federal
arbitrage requirements.
   (E)   Long-term debt will be issued for capital improvements or to purchase
equipment with a minimum expected life of five years. The city will not use
long-term borrowing to finance annual operating needs. The term of any bond
issue will not exceed the useful life of the capital project/facility or
equipment for which the borrowing is intended.
   (F)   The city will attempt to avoid short-term debt to provide cash flow
for annual operations. Debt issued for operating purposes will be limited to
cases where there is reasonable certainty that a known source of revenue will
be received in the current fiscal year sufficient to repay the debt or where
there is a clear financial emergency.
   (G)   The city will comply with all applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) and Treasury arbitrage requirements for bonded indebtedness in order to
preserve the tax-exempt status of such bonds.
   (H)   Bond issues will be planned to minimize the frequency of issuance,
thereby ensuring the lowest possible costs of issuance. When determining the
size of a bond issue, consideration shall be given to the need for
construction, debt service and capitalized interest funds. Construction fund
draw schedules shall be prepared and projection of earnings on unspent bond
funds shall be made in conjunction with the city’s CIP planning.
   (I)   The decision to use bond proceeds to pay interest during construction
for revenue-producing projects shall be made on a case by case basis and shall
be based on an evaluation of the opportunity cost of funds and the availability
of other sources of funds to pay interest costs.
   (J)   GO bonds will be amortized on a level principal basis to the extent
practical, and revenue bonds will be amortized on a level debt service basis to
the extent practical considering the forecasted available pledged revenues.
   (K)   The city shall not endorse the obligation of any entity. However, the
city may enter into contracts with other regional or local public entities with
respect to public purpose projects, which provide for certain payments when
project or entity revenues prove insufficient to cover debt service on
obligation issued to finance such project(s). The city will enter into these
types of agreements only when there is long-term public and financial interest
in the regional or local project(s). The obligation could be structured as
moral obligation bonds, or with an underlying support agreement or other
contractual arrangement. These obligations do not affect the legal debt limit
of the city and all payments shall be subject to annual appropriation. However,
if such payments were made, the obligations would be considered tax supported
debt.
   (L)   The city’s preferred method of sale of bonds is via competitive sale
to underwriters. If deemed advantageous, the city may sell bonds via a
negotiated sale, private placement, or other method. Coordination will be made
with the city’s financial advisor in arriving at a recommendation to issue
bonds through a method other than competitive sale.
(1984 Code, § 40.03) (Ord. O-07-19, passed 3-26-2019)
§ 40.04 UNDERWRITER SELECTION.
   (A)   Senior manager selection. The city shall select a senior manager for
any proposed negotiated sale. The selection criteria shall include, but not
limited to the following:
      (1)   Ability and experience in managing transactions similar to that
contemplated by the city;
      (2)   Prior knowledge, experience and support of the city;
      (3)   Ability and willingness to risk capital and demonstration of such
risk and capital availability;
      (4)   Quality and experience of personnel assigned to the city’s
engagement;
      (5)   Financing plan; and
      (6) Underwriting fees.
   (B)   Co-manager selection. Co-managers may be selected on the same basis as
the senior manager. In addition to their qualifications, co-managers appointed
to specific transactions will be a function of transaction size and the
necessity to ensure maximum distribution of the city’s bonds.
   (C)   Underwriter’s counsel. In any negotiated sale of city debt in which
legal counsel is required to represent the underwriter, the appointment will be
made by the senior manager with final approval from the city.
   (D)   Underwriter’s discount. The city will evaluate the proposed
underwriter’s discount against comparable issues in the market. If there are
multiple underwriters in the transaction, the city will determine the
allocation of underwriting liability and management fees, if any. The
allocation of fees will be determined prior to the sale date: a cap on
management fees, expenses and underwriter’s counsel fee will be established and
communicated to all parties by the city. The senior manager shall submit an
itemized list of expenses charged to members of the underwriting group. Any
additional expenses must be substantiated.
   (E)   Evaluation of underwriter performance. In conjunction with its
financial advisor, the city will evaluate each bond sale after completion to
assess the following: costs of issuance including underwriters’ compensation,
pricing of the bonds in terms of the overall interest cost and on a maturity-
by-maturity basis, and the distribution of bonds and sales credits.
   (F)   Designation policies. To encourage the pre-marketing efforts of each
member of the underwriting team, orders for the city’s bonds will be net
designated, unless otherwise expressly stated. The city shall require the
senior manager to:
      (1)   Fairly allocate bonds to other managers and the selling group;
      (2)   Comply with Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)
regulations governing the priority of orders and allocations; and
      (3)   Within ten working days after the sale date, submit to the city a
detail of orders, allocations and other relevant information pertaining to the
city’s sale.
(1984 Code, § 40.04) (Ord. O-07-19, passed 3-26-2019)
§ 40.05 LIMITATIONS ON LEVEL OF DEBT TO BE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING.
   (A)   Constitutional and statutory limitations. Section 158 of the
Constitution of Kentucky established the city’s legal debt margin at 10% of the
assessed value of real property within the city shown by the last preceding
assessment for taxes.
   (B)   Self-imposed debt targets.
      (1)   For all of the city’s self-imposed debt targets, the city may
exclude all or a portion of any bonds or leases that are self-supporting.
      (2)   Net tax-supported GO debt service shall not exceed 10% of General
Fund revenues.
      (3)   Net tax-supported GO debt will be structured in a manner such that
not less than 60% of the aggregate outstanding tax-supported debt will be
retired within ten years.
(1984 Code, § 40.05) (Ord. O-07-19, passed 3-26-2019)
§ 40.06 TYPES OF DEBT ISSUANCE.
   (A)   The city may issue GO debt for capital or other properly approved
projects.
   (B)   The city may issue revenue bonds to fund proprietary activities that
generate adequate revenues from user fees to support operations and debt
service requirements. The bonds will include written legal covenants which
require that revenue sources are adequate to fund annual operating expenses and
annual debt service requirements.
   (C)   Capital leases may be used to purchase buildings, equipment, furniture
and fixtures. The term of any capital lease shall not exceed the useful life of
the asset leased.
   (D)   Short-term borrowing may be utilized for interim financing or for
other purposes as described below. The city will determine and utilize the
least costly method for short-term borrowing subject to the following policies:
      (1)   Bond anticipation notes (BANs) may be issued for capital related
cash purposes to reduce the debt service during the construction period of a
project or to provide interim financing for a project. The BANs shall not
mature more than five years from the date of issuance.
      (2)   Lines of credit shall be considered as an alternative to other
short-term borrowing options.
      (3)   Other short-term debt may be used when such instruments provide an
interest rate advantage or as interim financing.
   (E)   Lease financing and master lease obligations, including lease revenue
bonds, may be considered as alternative financing structures.
(1984 Code, § 40.06) (Ord. O-07-19, passed 3-26-2019)
§ 40.07 REFUNDING OF DEBT.
   The city will refund debt when it is in the best financial interest of the
city to do so.
   (A)   Debt service savings. When a refunding is undertaken to generate
interest rate savings, the minimum aggregate present value savings will be 3%
of the refunded bond principal amount.
   (B)   Restructuring. Refunding to restructure debt will be limited to
restructuring to alleviate debt service during difficult budgetary years,
achieve cost savings, mitigate irregular debt service payments, release reserve
funds or remove unduly restrictive bond covenants.
   (C)   Term of refunding issues. The city will refund bonds within the term
of the originally issued debt. However, the city may consider maturity
extension, when necessary to achieve a desired outcome, provided that such
extension is legally permissible. The city also may consider shortening the
term of the originally issued debt to realize greater savings. The remaining
useful life of the financed facility and the concept of inter-generational
equity should guide this decision.
   (D)   Escrow structuring. The city shall utilize the least costly securities
available in structuring refunding escrows. A certificate will be provided by a
third-party agent stating that the securities were procured through an arms-
length, competitive bid process (in the case of open market securities), and
that the price paid for the securities was reasonable within federal
guidelines. Under no circumstances shall an underwriter, agent or financial
advisor sell escrow securities to the city from its own account.
   (E)   Arbitrage. The city shall take all necessary steps to optimize escrows
and to avoid negative arbitrage in its refunding. Any resulting positive
arbitrage will be rebated as necessary according to federal guidelines.
(1984 Code, § 40.07) (Ord. O-07-19, passed 3-26-2019)
§ 40.08 INVESTOR RELATIONS, DISCLOSURE AND COMMUNICATION.
   (A)   Debt ratios will be computed annually and reported in the
comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR), along with a computation of net
tax- supported debt per capita.
   (B)   The city will maintain communication with bond rating agencies to keep
them abreast of its financial condition by providing them the city’s CAFR,
annual budget and CIP.
   (C)   The city will comply with all of its undertakings in accordance with
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 41.01 INTENT.
   This policy is intended to set forth guidelines and a framework within which
city staff should operate while negotiating industrial revenue bond (IRB)
incentives so that the city can ensure sustainable revenues to deliver high
quality services to citizens.
(1984 Code, § 41.01) (Ord. O-43-18, passed 12-11-2018)
INCENTIVE GUIDING PRINCIPLES
§ 41.15 LAST TO THE TABLE.
   City staff will underwrite and review incentive requests after all other
private financing has been maximized and committed.
(1984 Code, § 41.02) (Ord. O-43-18, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 41.16 ALL DEALS UNDERWRITTEN.
   Each development project must deliver a positive, long-term return on
investment for the city to offset the additional city services created by the
development project.
(1984 Code, § 41.02) (Ord. O-43-18, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 41.17 COMMERCIAL VERSUS RESIDENTIAL TERM.
   While both development types are important facets of the city’s economic
development goals, commercial uses contribute greater direct returns on
investment and will be prioritized and incentivized accordingly.
   (A)   Commercial. To capture long-term revenue associated with payroll
taxes, commercial industrial revenue bond terms can be more flexible in order
to subsidize the development and attract new payroll tax revenue streams to the
city. However, in order to realize a strong return on investment, the city must
be cautious about offering employer incentives at the same location.
   (B)   Residential. At no point will the city’s payment in lieu of taxes
(PILOT) of the assessed value be less than 100% after 20 years.
   (C)   Mixed-use. The development will be reviewed based on the primary use
by square footage. Incentive terms will reflect whether the development is
primarily commercial or residential and the number and estimated wages for the
types of permanent jobs to be created.
(1984 Code, § 41.02) (Ord. O-43-18, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 41.18 MARKET VALUE.
   After the project is built, the industrial revenue bond assessed value for
determining the PILOT will be determined by the PVA, not negotiated.
(1984 Code, § 41.02) (Ord. O-43-18, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 41.19 TAX RATES.
   Property tax rates used for determining annual PILOT payments will reflect
the actual tax rates for that calendar year and will not be “locked in”
throughout the term.
(1984 Code, § 41.02) (Ord. O-43-18, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 41.20 PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES (PILOT).
   (A)   PILOT percentages shall gradually increase over the term, not remain
static throughout the term.
   (B)   At no point will the city’s PILOT on a residential or primarily
residential mixed-use project be less than 100% after 20 years.
(1984 Code, § 41.02) (Ord. O-43-18, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 41.21 ASSIGNABILITY.
   City industrial revenue bond benefits are not to be assignable or
transferable unless approved in writing after reviewing the proposed sale
terms. Otherwise, a sale or transfer triggers a return to the full tax rate,
payment of any outstanding balance and end of city ownership of the property.
(1984 Code, § 41.02) (Ord. O-43-18, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 41.22 EXCEPTIONS.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Commissioners may authorize
industrial revenue bond terms and conditions which do not meet all requirements
of this chapter so long as such terms and conditions are thoroughly reviewed by
city staff and there are specific findings recorded in appropriate legislation
documenting that it is necessary to amend the terms and conditions, one or more
community goals will be met by the amendment, and it is in the city’s best
interest to allow a deviation from the typical IRB policy requirements.

§ 42.01 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   It shall be the policy of the city to establish and maintain a prudent level
of financial resources to guard against service disruption in the event of
unexpected revenue shortfalls or unpredicted expenditures.
(1984 Code, § 42.01) (Ord. O-05-19, passed 3-12-2019)
§ 42.02 POLICE AND FIREMAN’S RETIREMENT PLAN FUND AND CITY EMPLOYEES’
RETIREMENT PLAN FUND.
   It shall be the policy of the city annually to fund the Police and Fireman’s
Retirement Plan Fund, and the City Employees’ Retirement Plan Fund based on the
most recent actuarial valuation report of each retirement plan fund. Such
funding shall be provided for from the city’s General Fund.
(1984 Code, § 42.02) (Ord. O-05-19, passed 3-12-2019)
§ 42.03 GENERAL FUND OPERATING RESERVE FUND.
   (A)   The General Fund Operating Reserve Fund is accumulated and maintained
to provide stability and flexibility in responding to unexpected adversity and/
or opportunities.
   (B)   The policy establishes the amounts the city shall strive to maintain
in its General Fund Operating Reserve Fund, how the Fund shall be funded and
the circumstances under which the Fund may be used.
   (C)   In addition, the policy is intended to document the appropriate
reserve level to protect the city’s credit worthiness.
   (D)   It is the goal of the city to maintain a General Fund Operating
Reserve Fund balance equivalent to at least three months of budgeted operating
revenues to meet the general operating expenses of the city during periods of
economic uncertainty. The General Fund Operating Reserve Fund balances can
provide for operations and continued tax stability should budgetary shortfalls
occur.
   (E)   The city shall evaluate the degree of risk it faces on an annual basis
and make a decision as to the level of financial resources that it wishes to
maintain not only for contingencies but for any transitional budgetary
shortfalls.
   (F)   The funding of the General Fund Operating Reserve Fund will generally
come from excess revenues over expenditures or one-time revenues.
   (G)   It is the intent of the city to limit use of the General Fund
Operating Reserve Fund to address unanticipated, non-recurring needs. The
General Fund Operating Reserve Fund shall not normally be applied to annual
operating expenditures. The General Fund Operating Reserve Fund may, however,
be used to allow time for the city to restructure its operations in a
deliberate manner (as might be required in an economic downturn), but such use
will only take place in the context of an adopted long-term plan.
   (H)   In the event that reserves are used resulting in a balance below the
three months minimum, a comprehensive plan shall be developed and included in
the formulation of the five-year forecast presented during the annual budget
process.
   (I)   To effectively manage the intent of this policy in light of the
changing accounting nature of the General Fund Operating Reserve Fund, an
annual review of the Fund shall be undertaken.
(1984 Code, § 42.03) (Ord. O-05-19, passed 3-12-2019)
§ 42.04 SELF-INSURED LIABILITY FUND.
   In order to provide for more reliable funding of the city’s Self-Insured
Liability Fund, a minimum of 40% of the historical average of the previous five
fiscal years of estimated liability, shall be allocated to and reserved in the
Self-Insured Liability Fund.
(1984 Code, § 42.04) (Ord. O-05-19, passed 3-12-2019)
§ 42.05 SELF-INSURED EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLAN FUND.
   In order to provide for more reliable funding of the city’s Self-Insured
Employee Health Plan, a minimum fund balance equal to three months’ worth of
claims’ expense in the employee health plan in a fiscal year, shall be
reserved, based on an average of the most recent three fiscal years’ claims’
expense amounts.
(1984 Code, § 42.05) (Ord. O-05-19, passed 3-12-2019)
§ 42.06 FLEET, EQUIPMENT, TECHNOLOGY, FACILITIES AND OTHER CAPITAL PROJECTS
FUND.
   In order to provide for the city’s business needs so that services can be
efficiently and effectively maintained and delivered, including fleet,
equipment, technology, facilities, and other capital projects as determined by
the Board of Commissioners, there is hereby established a Fleet, Equipment,
Technology, Facilities, and other Capital Projects Fund. The proceeds realized
from Ordinance O-5-15, establishing an increase in the city’s insurance premium
license fee from 10% to 12%, the increase of which shall be allocated to the
Fleet, Equipment, Technology, Facilities and other Capital Projects Fund.
(1984 Code, § 42.06) (Ord. O-05-19, passed 3-12-2019)
§ 42.07 INFRASTRUCTURE FUND.

§ 42.10 1324 MADISON AVENUE CAPITAL RESERVE FUND.
   (A)   The property located at 1324 Madison Avenue, Covington, KY (the
“property”) was developed by the City of Covington for the purpose of providing
leasable office and program space for the public workforce system. The annual
proceeds of the lease payments, after costs for management and repairs, are
dedicated to furthering economic development throughout the city. The cost of
designing, developing, improving, operating, repairing, and maintaining the
property and its improvements should therefore be allocated, to the extent
practicable, to the city. In order to provide revenue to fund those costs and
to fairly allocate those costs, a 1324 Madison Avenue Capital Reserve Fund
("the Fund") is established.
   (B)   A minimum of $110,000 of the annual lease proceeds collected for
office space at the property shall be deposited into the Fund until a balance
of $2,000,000 is reached. The City Board of Commissioners may make additional
appropriations to the Fund. All disbursements from the Fund shall be for the
purposes of the Fund as set forth in this section.
   (C)   The 1324 Madison Avenue Capital Reserve Fund is established to provide
financial resources to address major capital project needs for the existing
leasable area of the structure, to increase the amount of leasable square
footage or for other major capital projects at the property that have been
approved by the City Board of Commissioners.
      (1)   The Fund may be used for debt service to repay the costs of
indebtedness incurred to fund projects when funds are inadequate.
      (2)   The Fund shall be reevaluated every five years to determine the
sufficiency of the funding level in light of the number of identified projects,
the projected costs of those projects, and debt obligations, if any. After each
reevaluation, the City Manager may recommend an increase or decrease in the
funding level of the Fund for consideration by the City Board of Commissioners.
      (3)   The Fund shall be used only to support improvements to the property
and may not be used for the purchase of equipment or other capital projects.

   (B)   Establishment of user fee. There is hereby established a user fee to
defray the reasonable costs associated with providing the services to residents
and businesses located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city.
      (1)   Calculating the residential user fee.
         (a)   Each calendar year, the Finance Director shall prepare a
financial analysis of the projected costs of providing the services during the
coming year, whether such costs are incurred under a franchise agreement or
otherwise.
         (b)   Based upon this analysis, the City Manager will establish a user
fee for residential parcels located in the city.
         (c)    The user fee is designated to be payable quarterly annually and
shall be due on or before March 31 each year for that calendar year’s user fee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the user fee for the calendar year 2024 only
shall be due on or before August 31, 2024.
         (d)   Fees for homestead units shall be adjusted to reflect the
homestead exemption provided in KRS 132.810.

users are to be paid directly to the contractor by such users, the city shall
adopt the monthly commercial rates established in the franchise agreement as
soon as practicable after the city has awarded the franchise and at the
beginning of each calendar year falling during the term of the franchise. If
the commercial rates are to be paid directly to the city, the Finance Director
shall prepare a financial analysis of the projected costs of providing
commercial services over the coming year, and the City Manager shall establish
monthly commercial rates for each calendar year based on the analysis so
provided.
   (C)   Residential user fees. Each owner of a residential parcel shall be
required to pay the residential user fee adopted pursuant to division (B)(1)

parcel as determined by the city and the county’s property records.
      (1)   Assignment of carts. The city shall assign the following number of
carts to each residential parcel according to the number of dwelling units
located on the parcel.

      (2)   Adjustment of residential user fees. Any owner of a residential
parcel in possession or making use of fewer carts than the number of carts
assigned to the parcel may request that the residential user fee be

adjustment is requested; and
         (b)   The city is able to verify that the number of carts remaining on
the parcel is less than the number of carts that were assigned to the parcel.
Any annual fees assessed under this section shall be prorated beginning on
first full calendar month following the return of the cart. Adjustments shall
only be made once per calendar year.
      (3)   Additional carts. Any owner of a residential parcel in possession
or making use of a number of carts that is greater than the number of carts
actually assigned to the residential parcel shall, in addition to any
residential user fee assessed in accordance with this section, pay a fee equal
to 50% of the residential user fee for each additional waste cart, and 25% of
the residential user fee for each additional recycling cart. Any residential
user fees assessed under this section shall be prorated beginning on first full
calendar month after which an additional cart is delivered to the parcel.
      (4)   Maximum number of carts. Any owner of a residential parcel in
possession or making use of a number of carts that is greater than the maximum
number of carts allowable for the size of a parcel shall be considered a
commercial user and shall be required to pay the applicable commercial rates.

90 - 119 days after due date    7.5% of the user fee
 
      (3)   If payment has not been made within 120 days from the due date, a
penalty equal to 10% of any unpaid user fees shall be assessed against any
owner of a residential parcel who has not yet paid the amount of the
residential user fee assessed on the residential parcel, and any interest
accruing thereupon, which together with any such unpaid amounts shall be added
to the real estate tax bills for that calendar year.
      (4)   The total amount due on account of user fees, excluding any
interest or penalties, shall bear an interest rate of 6% per annum beginning on
the day after the last day upon which real estate taxes are due.

Kenton Counties and from time to time may supplement that list.
   (E)   Industrial and commercial users of the city sewer system shall
provide, at each connection with the sewer system, suitable manholes to
facilitate observation sampling and measuring of the waste being discharged.
Such manholes shall be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications
approved by the Department of Public Works of the city. All manholes shall be
installed and maintained in a safe condition at the expense of the owner of the
premises being served, and shall be located so as to be accessible at all times
to authorized employees of the city without the consent of the owner.

section. Any person notified of a suspension of sewer line service shall
immediately stop or eliminate the prohibited discharge.
      (1)   In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with any order or
demand by the Department of Public Works, the city, through the Department,
shall take such measures as it deems necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize interference with or
endangerment to any individuals.
      (2)   The city shall reinstate sewer line service upon satisfactory proof
by the user of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed
written statement submitted by the user describing the cause of prohibited
waste discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall
be submitted to the Department of Public Works within 15 days of the date of
the occurrence. If the sewer line connection has been severed as provided
herein, the user shall pay the reasonable costs of severance and reconnection.
   (H)   Any user who violates any of the following conditions is subject to
having his or her user’s sewer permit revoked and the sewer line disconnected
in accordance with the procedures set forth herein:
      (1)   Non-compliance with any of the prohibitions and regulations imposed
by this section;
      (2)   Failure to install a properly constructed sampling and testing
manhole as required by this section; or
      (3)   Refusal of the user to permit access by the city to the sampling
and testing manhole.

has violated or is violating the prohibitions and regulations of this section,
the city shall serve upon such user by certified or registered mail a written
notice stating the nature of the violation and requiring the user to show cause
within 30 days why the user’s sewer permit should not be revoked, or the user’s
sewer line not be severed, or if severed as provided herein, reconnected.

any party at cost.
      (4)   The Board of Commissioners is empowered to issue subpoenas signed
by the Mayor or City Manager to compel the attendance of witnesses and
production of documents.
   (K)   (1)   In any such hearing, the burden of proof to show cause shall be
upon the user. If warranted by the evidence, the Board of Commissioners may
issue an order to the user responsible for the prohibited discharge or
violation of any of the regulations herein, that following a specified time
period not to exceed 30 days, the sewer service shall be discontinued unless
the violation is completely corrected.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the
immediate disconnection of any sewer line to prevent discharges into the city

facilities for observation, testing and sampling.
(1984 Code, § 50.03) (Ord. O-7-87, passed 2-17-1987; Ord. O-54-90, passed 10-

50.99
STORM WATER AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT FEE
§ 50.10 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city maintains a system of the storm and surface water management
facilities including but not limited to inlets, conduits, manholes, channel,
ditches, drainage easement, retention and detention basins, infiltration
facilities, and other components, as well as natural waterways, specifically
excluding combined sewer systems.
   (B)   This is commonly referred to as a "Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System" or "MS4" as defined at 401 KAR 5:002, Section 1(111) and 40 C.F.R.
122.26(b)(8).
   (C)   The storm water system in the city requires regular maintenance and
improvements.
   (D)   Storm water quality is degraded due to erosion and the discharge of
nutrients, metals, oil, grease, toxic materials, and other substances into and
through the storm water system.
   (E)   The public health, safety, and welfare are adversely affected by poor
ambient water quality and flooding.
   (F)   All real property in the City of Covington either uses or benefits
from the maintenance of the storm water system.
   (G)   The extent of use of the storm water system by each property is
dependent on factors that influence runoff, including land use and the amount
of impervious surface on the property.
   (H)   The cost of improving, maintaining, operating and monitoring the storm
water system should be allocated, to the extent practicable, to all property
owners based on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of their
property on the storm water management system.
   (I)   Management of the storm water system to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare requires adequate revenues and it is in the interest of the
public to finance storm water management adequately with a user fee system that
is reasonable and equitable so that each use of the system pays to the extent
to which they contribute to the need for it.
   (J)   The city is required to develop a storm water quality program through
the NPDES Phase II storm water program that is required by state and federal
law.
   (K)   The MS4 program specifically does not apply to combined sewers; SD1
retains full responsibility for the combined sewer system in Covington,
including any storm water issues attributable to the inadequacies of the
combined sewer system.
(Ord. O-02-21, passed 2-23-2021)
§ 50.11 AUTHORITY.
   Authority for the adoption of this system of user fees to fund the
implementation of storm water and flood management program is derived from KRS
91A.510 - .530. which allows for the adoption of a user fee for the City of
Covington's storm water quality program, which Covington is required to adopt
through the NPDES Phase II storm water program that is an unfunded mandate by
state and federal law, and for the flood management aspects of the storm water
and flood management program that will be funded by the Storm Water and Flood
Management Fee. In addition, pursuant to KRS 82.082, Covington has home rule
authority to provide for the health and safety of its residents regarding storm
water and flooding.

§ 50.13 ESTABLISHMENT OF STORM WATER AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT FUND.
   (A)   The storm water and flood management program is established and the
storm water system is provided to protect the waterways and land in the city by
managing flooding and to benefit the natural environment. The cost of
designing, developing, improving, operating, maintaining, and monitoring the
storm water system required in the city should, therefore, be allocated to the
extent practicable, to all property owners based on their impact on the storm
water system. In order to provide revenue to fund those costs and to fairly
allocate those costs, a Storm Water and Flood Management Fund ("the Fund") is
established.
   (B)   All revenues collected for the purpose of storm water and flood
management from user fees, grants, permit fees, and other charges collected
under the subchapter, shall be deposited into the Fund. The City Board of
Commissioners may make additional appropriations to the Fund. All disbursements
from the Fund shall be for the purposes of the Fund as set forth in this
subchapter. The fund shall be administered per KRS 91A.530.
      (1)   Within the Storm Water and Flood Management Fund there are
established two subordinate reserve accounts:
         (a)   The Insurance Reserve is established to provide financial
reserves for the Backup Assistance Program. The Insurance Reserve is available
to pay any claims or costs arising out of the Backup Assistance Program
Agreement.
            a.   The Reserve shall be initially funded with $250,000. The
appropriation shall carry forward at the conclusion of each fiscal year and
shall not lapse. Any payments made from the Reserve shall be replenished from
the Fund at the start of the next fiscal year. The appropriation shall be
reevaluated every three years to determine the sufficiency of the fund in light
of the number of agreements and the actual risk experience. After each re-
evaluation the City Manager may recommend an increase or decrease in the
funding level of the Reserve for consideration by the Board of Commissioners.
            b.   If the Insurance Fund is insufficient to pay the claims or
costs attributable to the Backup Assistance Program Agreement, other revenues
available in the Storm Water and Flood Management Fund, including the Major
Capital Project Reserve, may be used upon approval of the Board of
Commissioners to pay such claims or costs.
         (b)   The Major Capital Project Reserve is established to provide
financial resources to address the inadequacies of the combined sewer system
that result in basement and/or street flooding.
            a.   The combined sewer system is owned by Sanitation District No.
1. The Reserve is intended to pay to upgrade the combined sewer system beyond
the service level standards of SD1 to a service level standard determined by
the city, so as to more substantively eliminate or reduce the frequency of
street and/or basement flooding.
            b.   The Reserve is intended to be used to supplement the funds
available to SD1 for service upgrades of the combined sewer system
            c.   The Major Capital Project Reserve fund shall be allocated
$500,000 from each year's anticipated receipts. In addition, 100% of the
unobligated carry forward from the preceding fiscal year shall be allocated to
the Reserve. The appropriation shall carry forward at the conclusion of each
fiscal year and shall not lapse.
            d.   The Reserve may be used for debt service to repay the costs of
indebtedness incurred to correct the inadequacies of the combined sewer system.
            e.   The Reserve shall be reevaluated every five years to determine
the sufficiency of the funding level in light of the number of identified
projects, their projected costs, and debt obligations, if any. After each
reevaluation the City Manager may recommend an increase or decrease in the
funding level of the Reserve for consideration by the Board of Commissioners.
            f.   This Reserve shall be used only to support improvements to the
combined sewer stem and may not be used for the purchase of equipment or other
capital projects.
   (C)   The city may expend general fund dollars to begin the transition from
Sanitation District No. 1 to Covington complying with the KPDES permit and
other requirements. Said amounts shall be itemized and submitted to the City
Board of Commissioners for the reimbursement of the general fund for dollars
expended on stormwater services. Going forward, any transfers from the general
fund, for which reimbursement may be sought, shall be first identified and
approved by the City Board of Commissioners.
   (D)   Nothing shall prohibit the city from seeking to borrow funds necessary
to fund the stormwater program set forth herein, either from either a financial
institution and/or the city's general fund.
(Ord. O-02-21, passed 2-23-2021; Ord. O-15-22, passed 8-9-2022)
§ 50.14 PURPOSE OF THE FUND.
   The Fund shall be used for the following purposes:
   (A)   The acquisition by gift, purchase, or condemnation of real property,
and interests therein, necessary to construct, operate, and maintain storm
water management facilities.
   (B)   All costs of administration and implementation of the storm water
management program, including the establishment of reasonable operation and
capital reserves to meet unanticipated or emergency storm water management
requirements.
   (C)   Engineering and design, debt services and related financing expenses,
construction costs for new facilities, and enlargement or improvement of
existing facilities.
   (D)   Operation and maintenance of the storm water systems.
   (E)   Monitoring, surveillance, and inspection of storm water control
devices.
   (F)   Water quality monitoring and water quality programs.
   (G)   Retrofitting developed areas for pollution control.
   (H)   Inspection and enforcement activities.
   (I)   Costs of public education related to storm water and related issues.
   (J)   Billing and administrative costs.
   (K)   Other activities which are reasonably required, including but not
limited to requirements set forth in the future by the Kentucky Division of
Water and/or Federal EPA.
(Ord. O-02-21, passed 2-23-2021)
§ 50.15 STORM WATER AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT FEE.
   A monthly service fee is imposed upon all real property in the city,
beginning no earlier than March 1, 2021, to fund storm water and flood
management programs. This service fee shall be known as the Storm Water and
Flood Management Fee ("Fee"). Any real property developed or added through
annexation into the city after March 1, 2021, shall be subject to a monthly
service fee. The fee is based on (1) the extent to which runoff from each
property creates the need for the storm water management program; (2) the
amount of impervious area on each property; and (3) the cost of implementing a
storm water and flood management program. The monthly service fee is
collectible as one single billed amount for residential properties and
quarterly billed amounts for commercial properties in accordance with §
50.21. For assessment purposes, the property owner of record as of January 1st
each calendar year shall bear responsibility for the Storm Water and Flood
Management Fee. The city may adjust the service fee for calendar year 2021 to
reflect a pro rata calculation.
(Ord. O-02-21, passed 2-23-2021)
§ 50.16 CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINATION OF THE STORM
WATER AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT FEE.
   For purposes of determining the Storm Water and Flood Management Fee, all
properties in the city are classified into one of the following classes:
   (A)   Single Family Residential (SFR) Property: The city finds that the
contribution to runoff of most parcels of real property in the city classified
as single family residential is similar and that it would be excessively and
unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the
improvements (such as building, structures, and other impervious areas) on each
parcel. Therefore, all single family residential properties in the city shall
be charged a flat Storm Water and Flood Management Fee, equal to the base rate,
as provided in §
50.17, Base Rate. If an adjacent property is owned, but evident to be party of
SFR, i.e. adjacent thereto, the adjacent property shall not be considered non-
developed property.
   (B)   Non-Single Family Residential (non- SFR): The fee for non-SFR property
in the city shall be the base rate multiplied by numerical factor obtained by
dividing the total impervious area (square feet) of the property by the ERU.
The impervious surface area for non-SFR property is the square footage for the
buildings and other improvements on the property. At the sole discretion of the
city, the impervious surface area of non-SFR property may be approximated
through site examination, mapping information, aerial photographs, and other
available information. The Minimum Storm Water and Flood Management Fee for
non-SFR property shall equal the base rate for single family residential
property. As set forth above, all condominium complexes in the city shall be
classified as non-SFR with a fee based on the complexes impervious surface area
submitted to the governing Homeowners Association Board (HOA). This practice
has been occurring prior to by Sanitation District No. 1. Owner-occupied mixed-
use buildings of less than the base rate ERU shall be considered Single Family
Residential Property.
   (C)   Non-Developed Property: The fee for non-developed property in the city
shall be a flat Storm Water Management Fee, equal to the base rate, as provided
in §
50.17, Base Rate.
   (D)   MS4 Exempt Property: Any real property in the city that does not fall
within the city's designed MS4 service area shall be assessed a fee to offset
the cost of administering the Storm Water and Flood Management program. For
these properties, the methods used to calculate the fees for the MS4 qualified
properties shall be used.
(Ord. O-02-21, passed 2-23-2021)
§ 50.17 BASE RATE.
   The city is regaining sole responsibility of its MS4 permit and program from
Sanitation District No. 1. For purposes of implementing its own MS4 program and
establishing the Storm Water and Flood Management fee, Covington adopts the
findings reached by SD1 regarding the average amount of impervious surface
areas for residential properties in the city. Covington adopts SD1's Covington
ERU of 2,600 square feet and a monthly base rate for the Storm Water and Flood
Management Fee is established for all single family residential property per
the 2,600 ERU.
(Ord. O-02-21, passed 2-23-2021)
§ 50.18 SCHEDULE OF MONTHLY RATES FOR STORM WATER AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT FEE.
   The following schedule of rates shall apply to each property owner. This
schedule includes the rate for the Storm Water and Flood Management Fees and
associated fees and costs.

§ 50.19 FEE FOR TAX-EXEMPT PROPERTIES; EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The city finds that all real property in the city contributes to
runoff and either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the stormwater
system. Therefore, all real property in the city, including property that is
tax exempt from property tax per the Kentucky Revised Statutes, as amended,
shall be subject to the fee.
   (B)   Property which is owned by the city shall be subject to the fee. All
federal, state, county, and city roads are exempt from the fee and are
considered to be part of the city drainage systems.

§ 50.20 ASSESSMENT NOTICES.
   (A)   The city may, but is not required to, send assessment notices for the
fee to property owners prior to the billing for the fee.
   (B)   If assessment notices are sent, the notice shall include the following
information:
      (1)   The classification of the property for purposes of determining the
fee;
      (2)   For property classified as Other Developed Property:
         a.   The impervious surface area of the property; and
         b.   The method by which the impervious surface area of the property
was determined; that is, whether the computation of the impervious surface area
of the property is based on information in the Kenton County Property Valuation
Office, site examination, mapping information, aerial photographs, or other
methods.
      (3)   The amount of the base rate (i.e., the Single Family Residential
Fee), and for Other Developed Property, the number of base units on the
property.

§ 50.21 WHEN STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FEE PAYABLE; PENALTIES, LIEN ON RENTAL
PROPERTY; ABATEMENT OF SMALL AMOUNTS DUE.
   (A)   The fee shall be billed by the city as set forth on the schedule
herein. The city makes the following findings regarding billing:
      (1)   That Single Family Residential properties shall receive a single
bill, similar to current city practices for billing solid waste disposal user
fees, with a bill due date no later than March 31.
      (2)   All other properties subject to the fees set forth herein shall be
billed quarterly, in arrears, i.e., a bill for Jan-March, will be issued on or
about April 1. The city makes a finding that many commercial bills are in
excess of the Single Family Residential and in order to continue to provide the
proper budgeting that the Commercial Properties have had with Sanitation
District No. 1 issuing quarterly bills, that said practice shall continue.
   (B)   If a bill is rendered to a party who is not the property owner and the
bill becomes unpaid and/or delinquent, then the property owner shall bear the
responsibility of payment. The city may add delinquent storm water and flood
management fees and associated penalties to a property tax bill.
   (C)   A delinquent fee that is not paid by the delinquency date shown on the
bill will incur a penalty of ten percent of the bill.
   (D)   A delinquent fee that is not paid by the delinquency date shown on the
bill will incur a penalty of 10% of the total bill, when overdue shall
constitute a lien on real property and may be collected by a suit against the
property owner or in an in rem action against the property.

§ 50.22 REQUEST FOR CORRECTION OF THE STORM WATER AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT FEE.
   (A)   A property owner may request correction of the fee by submitting the
request in writing to the office of the City Clerk within 30 days after the
date the assessment notice or the bill is mailed or issued to the property
owner. The City Clerk shall forward the request to the City Manager with a copy
to the City Solicitor. The City Manager shall grant or deny the request based
on the following considerations:
      (1)   Incorrect classification of the property for purposes of
determining the fee;
      (2)   Errors in the square footage of the impervious surface area of the
property;
      (3)   Mathematical errors in calculating the fee to be applied to the
property; and
      (4)   Errors in the identification of the property owner of a property
subject to the fee.
   (B)   The City Manager shall make a written determination within 60 days
after the receipt of the property owner's completed written request for
correction of the fee.
   (C)   A property owner must comply with all rules and procedures adopted by
the City Manager when submitting a request for correction of the fee and must
provide all information necessary for the City Manager to make a determination
on a request for correction of the fee. If a property owner alleges an error
under §
50.22(A)(2), the request for correction must include a certification by a
registered engineer or professional land surveyor of the impervious surface
area of the property. Failure to comply with the provisions of the subsection
shall be grounds for denial of the request.
   (D)   A property owner who disagrees with the City Manager's decision may
appeal that decision to the Covington Board of Commissioners. Such appeal must
be made in writing and submitted to the City Clerk, with a copy to the City
Manager and City Solicitor, no later than 30 days after the City Manager's
written determination is issued. The Covington Board of Commissioners shall
schedule a hearing to hear the appeal and render a decision no later than 60
days after confirmed receipt of the appeal request by the City Clerk. The Board
of Commissioner's decision on a request for correction of the fee shall be
final.

(Ord. O-14-22, passed 8-9-2022)
§ 50.33 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The City of Covington shall
be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this
subchapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this
subchapter.
      (1)   If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger
shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the
city.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required bu this subchapter.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the city has been refused access to any part of
the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he or she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance
of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 50.34 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The city will adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices for
any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the
United States. The owner or operator of such activity, operation, or facility
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise that
is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at the person's expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with
all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs
shall be part of a storm water management plan (SWMP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. O-14-22, passed 8-9-2022)
§ 50.35 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States, the person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials the person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, the person shall notify the city in person
or by phone or facsimile or by electronic means, including but not limited to
email, no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone
shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within
one business day of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three years.
   Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a
violation of this subchapter.
(Ord. O-14-22, passed 8-9-2022)
§ 50.36 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this subchapter, the city may impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
   (B)   Emergency cease and desist orders. When the city finds that any person
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, or any
order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to
recur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to
an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States
which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city may issue an
order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the violator to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this section
shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In
the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
emergency order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize harm to the MS4, or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment
to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a
facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
The city may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment
has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the
discharger under this subchapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or in
part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city within three
days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the violator.
   (C)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United
States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize
danger to persons.
   (D)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subchapter may have their MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its
MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and
hearing.
   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city.
(Ord. O-14-22, passed 8-9-2022)
§ 50.37 VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this subchapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is
declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the
violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel
the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.

POST CONSTRUCTION RUNOFF CONTROL
§ 50.50 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the
public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-
construction storm water runoff and non-point source pollution associated with
new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper
management of construction- related and post-construction storm water runoff
will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure,
safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare, protect water and
aquatic resources and establishes methods for controlling the introduction of
pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to
comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this subchapter are:
      (1)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that
protects the integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water
resources;
      (2)   Minimizing changes to the pre-development hydrologic response for
new development and redevelopment in their post- construction state in
accordance with the requirements of this subchapter for the applicable design
storm in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, and non-point and point
source pollution, as well as to maintain the integrity of stream channels,
aquatic habitats and healthy stream temperatures;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-construction storm water management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of storm water
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function. and use of structural storm water control facilities that may be used
to meet the minimum post-construction storm water management standards;
      (5)   Establishing criteria for the use of better management and site
design practices, such as the preservation of green space and other
conservation areas;
      (6)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural storm water best management
practices (BMPs) to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are
maintained appropriately, and pose minimum risk to public safety; and
      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of storm water management plans, for the inspection of
approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.

   (A)   The Parking Authority may designate times for parking lots and parking

available to the public upon request.
   (B)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted to mean that parking
meters are required to be installed at every available location or within any
designated Parking Meter Zone and, any parking meter, whether currently
existing or later installed, may, at the discretion of the Parking Authority,

it is determined that the meter or meters are not necessary or practical to
regulate and control vehicular traffic at the existing location.
   (C)   The Parking Authority, or its designee, is hereby authorized and
directed to repair, replace, and maintain all authorized parking meters and to
install wherever appropriate to carry the provisions of this subchapter into
effect, instructions for use of meter, signs and/or pavement markings to
indicate the correct parking space adjacent to each parking meter.
   (D)   All authorized parking meters shall be placed adjacent to individual
parking spaces and shall be placed so as to display a signal that shall
indicate by a mechanical operation the unexpired time which has been paid for
and whether the time paid for has expired. In the alternative, where parking
meters have been installed in a parking lot or parking garage or in an area
where parking meters in the form of pay stations are utilized to regulate on-
street parking, any such parking meters shall be placed in an area that is
conveniently accessed by individuals who are parking vehicles within any such
parking lot, parking garage, or on-street parking.

days from the date of receipt of the written request for hearing, unless prior
to the hearing the person requesting the hearing requests an extension of time
not to exceed 14 days. No less than seven days prior to the date set for the

procedure. The action shall be tried de novo and the burden shall be upon the
city to establish that a violation occurred. If the court finds that a
violation occurred, the owner shall be ordered to pay to the city all fines,
fees and penalties occurring as of the date of the judgment. If the court finds
that a violation did not occur, the city shall be ordered to dismiss the
citation and the plaintiff shall be authorized to recover his or her costs.

county’s Circuit Court in accordance with the rules of civil procedure.

in addition to the fines levied for the parking or traffic offenses, may, by

   In addition to the penalties levied for the parking violations, the city or
its designee, or the Parking Authority, or its designee, may impose towing,

the payment of the penalty levied for the parking violations and any towing,
holding and storage charges imposed thereon by the city or its designee, or the

to possession challenges the validity of the impoundment or immobilization
pursuant to §
74.089 of this chapter.
   (B)   With respect to vehicles impounded by the city or the Parking
Authority, in addition to the towing fees, the city or the Parking Authority

   (C)   An impounded vehicle may be released to the owner or other person
entitled to possession only upon proof of ownership or right to possession. The
city or its designee, or the Parking Authority, or its designee, may require
reasonable security, bond or other assurances of indemnification from a person
who is not the registered owner of the vehicle prior to releasing the vehicle
to such person.

§ 74.089 IMPOUNDMENT; HEARING; APPEAL.
   (A)   The owner of a motor vehicle which has been impounded or immobilized
pursuant to this subchapter or other person entitled to possession, may
challenge the validity of such impoundment or immobilization and request in
writing a hearing before the Parking Violation Hearing Board. The hearing shall
be conducted within ten business days of the date of the request, unless the
owner or other person entitled to possession waives the limitation or the city
or the Parking Authority shows good cause for such delay. The city or its
designee, or the Parking Authority, or its designee, shall retain possession of
an impounded vehicle pending the hearing, unless the owner or other person
claiming right of possession posts a bond in an amount equal to the fines and
fees accrued as of the date of the hearing request, or $75 whichever is less.
If the owner or person claiming possession of the impounded vehicle is unable
to pay the amount of the bond, the hearing shall be held within 72 hours of the
date the request for hearing is received, unless such person requests or agrees
to a continuance.
   (B)   No less than five days prior to the date set for the hearing, the
Board shall notify the person requesting the hearing of the date, time and
place of the hearing. In the case of a hearing required to be held within 72
hours of the date of the request as provided in division (A) above, the person
requesting the hearing shall be informed at the time of his or her request, or
as soon thereafter as is practicable, of the date and time of the hearing.
   (C)   Any person who refuses or except for good cause fails to appear at the
time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have conceded on his or
her and the owner’s behalf the validity of the impoundment or immobilization.
   (D)   At the hearing, after consideration of the evidence, the Board shall
determine whether the impoundment or immobilization was valid and reasonable.
Where it has not been established that the impoundment or immobilization was
justified, an order releasing the vehicle shall be entered. All fines and fees
paid or amounts posted as bond because of the impoundment of a vehicle shall be
returned and the owner shall not be responsible for any fees owed to a
designated towing company. Where it has been established that the impoundment
or immobilization was justified, the Board shall uphold the impoundment or
immobilization and condition the release of the vehicle upon payment of all
fines and fees accruing thereto. If bond has been posted as security for
release of the vehicle, the bond shall be forfeited to the city or its
designee. All fines or fees in excess of the amount of the bond posted shall be
ordered to be paid by the owner of the vehicle to the city. The Board shall
furnish the owner or person appearing on the owner’s behalf with a copy of its
order.
   (E)   The Board may consider a parking citation and any other written report
made under oath by the issuing citation officer in lieu of the officer’s
personal appearance at the hearing.
   (F)   An appeal from the Hearing Board’s determination may be made to the
county’s District Court within seven days of the Board’s determination. The
appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a copy of the
Board’s order in the same manner as any civil action. The action shall be tried
de novo and the burden shall be on the city or the Parking Authority to
establish that impoundment was justified. If the court finds that the
impoundment was justified, the owner shall be ordered to pay all fees and fines
accruing as of the date of judgment. If the court finds that the impoundment
was not justified, the city or the Parking Authority shall be ordered to
release the vehicle, if applicable, and to return all fines and fees paid as a
result of the impoundment and the plaintiff shall be authorized to recover his
costs.
   (G)   The judgment of the county’s District Court may be appealed to the
county’s Circuit Court in accordance with the rules of civil procedure.

   (A)   If within ten business days of impoundment a motor vehicle has not
been claimed, or a hearing has not been requested, notice shall be mailed by
certified mail to the registered owner, if known, and lienholders of record, if
any, affording such parties the right within ten days from the date of notice
to claim the vehicle or request a hearing. The notice shall state that, if no
hearing is requested, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned unless the charges
thereon are paid within 45 days of receipt of the notice.
   (B)   After 45 days from the date of notice required by division (A) above,
an impounded vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and the vehicle shall escheat to
and become the property of the city or become the property of the city’s
designee.
   (C)   (1)   If the vehicle that has escheated to the city pursuant to
division (B) above is judged suitable for use, the city may obtain a
certificate of registration and ownership from the County Clerk pursuant to KRS
186.020 and either use the vehicle for governmental purposes or sell the
vehicle at public auction to the highest bidder.
      (2)   If the vehicle is not suitable for use, it may be sold for its
scrap or junk value.
   (D)   (1)   The city shall possess a lien on a motor vehicle impounded
pursuant to the provisions hereof for all fines, penalties and towing, handling
and storage charges and fees imposed thereon.
      (2)   Such lien shall be superior to and have priority over all other
liens thereon.

County Clerk, according to KRS 189.456, shall make application with the Public
Works Department for a designated parking space on a public street within the
city.
   (B)   If the Public Works Department finds that the person making the
application has obtained the required permit from the County Clerk, that local
ordinances or state statutes do not prohibit or limit parking on the street,
and no reasonably accessible off-street parking serves or accommodates the
disabled person’s residence, the Department may designate, in its discretion, a
reserved parking space on a public street near the residence of the disabled
person. The term OFF-STREET PARKING shall include, but not be limited to,
driveways and garages serving a residence.
   (C)   A designated parking space shall not be more than 23 feet in length.
Only one designated parking space will be allowed per household. The city may
charge a reasonable fee to applicants for designated parking spaces. Any
disabled person with a parking permit issued pursuant to KRS 189.456 is
permitted to park in any designated parking space created by this section.
   (D)   An applicant who obtains a designated parking space under this section
shall be required to renew this space every year. Failure to renew a designated
parking space shall be grounds to remove a disabled/handicapped parking sign
placed on a public street near the applicant’s residence.
   (E)   (1)   If the Public Works Department denies an application for a
designated parking space, the applicant may appeal this denial to the
Handicapped Parking Review Committee by filing a notice of appeal with the
Public Works Department, Traffic Division, within 30 days after the date of
denial. The Handicapped Parking Review Committee shall consist of one member
each from the Engineering Department, the Police Department and the Public

decision.
      (3)   If an applicant fails to appeal a denial by the Public Works
Department or a decision of the Parking Review Committee within the time frames
set forth herein, such denial or decision shall not be subject to further
review. An applicant who is denied a designated parking space under this
section may not re-apply for such a space for a period of 12 months after the
date of denial or if such denial is appealed, 12 months after the date when a
final decision is rendered in the appeal.

including genus and species, his or her common name, gender, color and other
distinguishing physical characteristics, including size and weight. An owner of
a vicious dog shall also submit two color photographs showing the color and
approximate size of the animal with the registration and obtain from the city a
vicious dog tag. In the case of dogs or other animals required by law to be
vaccinated for rabies, proof of rabies vaccination shall also be provided.
Registration shall be completed for all animals that are located or kept within
the territorial limits of the city for a period exceeding 24 hours. The
registration period shall run from July 1 to June 30 of the following year. If
a city license was obtained for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, it will be valid

of the animal by a veterinarian, or other properly trained and authorized
individual, and shall be designed so that, when scanned by an electronic
reader, it is capable of providing the identification of the dog’s owner. If
such a dog is impounded, the microchip shall be installed or injected prior to
its release. The owner or possessor of such a dog shall be responsible for
payment of the costs associated with the installation or injection of a
microchip in the animal.
   (D)   Insurance. An owner of a vicious dog must produce evidence that he or
she has the ability to respond in damages up to and including the amount of
$100,000 for bodily injury to or death of any person or persons or for damage
to property that may result from the ownership, keeping or maintenance of such

outside of its kennel, pen or the owner’s residence unless such animal is
securely restrained with a leash or lead no longer than three feet in length
and the leash or lead is physically controlled by a person 18 years of age or
older who is in physical control of the leash. Such animals may not be leashed
to inanimate objects such as trees, posts, buildings and the like. In addition,

by itself is insufficient to meet this standard. All structures used to confine
such animals must be locked with a key or combination lock when such animals
are within the structure. Such structure must have a secure bottom or floor
attached to the sides of the pen, or the sides of the pen must be embedded in
the ground to a depth of no less than two feet and be a minimum of seven feet
above the ground to the top of the structure. All structures erected to house
such animals must comply with all zoning and building regulations, and all such
structures must be adequately lighted, ventilated and be of appropriate size to
allow the animal confined therein to move around, and must be kept in a clean
and sanitary condition. The house or shelter for said animal shall be totally
enclosed within the confinement structure. When being transported, the animal
must be muzzled or caged.
         (a)   Signs. All owners of vicious dogs shall display on the kennel or
pen and also in a prominent place on the premises a sign easily read by the
public from adjoining public roads or streets using a sign stating the presence
of a vicious dog by both symbol and words.

public are being met.

within the city’s territorial limits unless all of the following conditions are
met:
      (1)   The animal is properly registered with the county;
      (2)   The animal is at all times kept or maintained in a safe manner and

animal;
      (4)   The health or well being of the animal is not in any way endangered

representative, no less than 30 calendar days prior to the date on which the

or on other persons. Notice of an application for a special variance shall be
given by the City Manager or his or her representative to all persons who own
and/or occupy the real property adjoining the site for which the special
variance is sought. Notice shall be forwarded by regular mail not less than 15
calendar days prior to the date on which the special variance is sought to be
effective. The failure of the City Manager or his or her representative to
notify any adjoining property owner/occupant shall not be fatal to the

effective.
      (3)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the City
Manager or his or her designated representative shall balance the hardship to
the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special
variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of
persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected and any other adverse
impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances and
persons contesting special variances may be required to submit any information
the City Manager or his or her representative may require. In granting or
denying an application, the City Manager or his or her representative shall
place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or
granting this special variance.
      (4)   Special variances shall be granted by permit issued to the
applicant containing all necessary conditions including a time limit on the
permitted activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all
conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any conditions of
the special variances shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to
those provisions of this section regulating the source of sound or activity for
which the special variance was granted. Any person granted a special variance
shall be required to present this permit to enforcement officials upon request.
Failure to present documentation of a variance may result in the issuance of a
citation under this section.
      (5)   Application for extension of time limits specified in special
variance or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated
like applications for initial special variances.
      (6)   The City Manager or his or her designated representative may issue
guidelines defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a special
variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a
special variance.

reason why an exception is requested, the name, address and age of the
applicant, and proposed place of purchase. The City Manager or his or her
designee shall investigate the matter and within five working days grant or
deny the application. Any denial may be appealed to the Code Enforcement Board.

section by giving five days’ written notice to the property owner to abate the
violation of keeping junked vehicles and said notice shall be served in
accordance with §
92.17(B). The city itself may abate or remove a nuisance referenced under this

the nuisance. The city shall have a lien against the property for the
reasonable value of labor and material used in remedying the nuisance
including, but not limited to, the cost of towing, holding, storage and
disposal. An affidavit of a Code Enforcement Officer shall constitute prima
facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the regularity of the proceedings
pursuant to this section and it shall be recorded in the office of the County
Clerk. The lien shall be notice to all persons from the time of its recording
and shall bear interest thereafter until paid. The lien created shall take

§ 92.15 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE CITY MANAGER OR DESIGNEE; RECORD KEEPING;

   (A)   To conduct surveys and make inspections in any area of the community
or within the city to determine compliance with this chapter or other
ordinances he or she is empowered to enforce;
   (B)   To investigate all complaints made about buildings, structures, vacant
lots or other premises within the city, whether they be verbal, written or in
the form of a petition, alleging or charging that a violation of this chapter
exists or that a dwelling, structure or building is unfit or unsafe for human
habitation or other occupancy;
   (C)   To inspect, survey or investigate any building, structure, dwelling or
premises between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., or at any time if an
emergency exists or if requested by the owner or occupant. A Code Enforcement
Officer may enter a building, structure, dwelling or premises to inspect,
survey or investigate with the consent of the owner or occupant, in emergency
situations, or when an inspection, survey or investigation is required before a
permit is issued or funding is provided by the city or is part of a licensing
scheme adopted by the city. If an owner or occupant refuses to consent to entry
or inspection of a building, structure, dwelling or premises, a Code
Enforcement Officer may obtain a search warrant for this purpose from a court
of appropriate jurisdiction. In addition, a Code Enforcement Officer may obtain
a search warrant to inspect several buildings or structures in a particular
area as part of an area inspection policy promulgated by the city. Probable
cause to issue a search warrant may be based upon the passage of time, the
nature of the building (e.g., a multi-family apartment house), the condition of
the entire area or other reasonable legislative or administrative standards
adopted by the city. Probable cause does not need to depend upon specific
knowledge of a condition existing in a particular dwelling. A Code Enforcement
Officer conducting an inspection pursuant to this chapter shall provide
identification and statement of purpose before entering any building,
structure, dwelling or premises and the person in possession or in charge of
the building, structure, dwelling or premises shall give the City Manager, or
his or her designee and his or her assistants, staff or employees free access
to such property for the purposes set forth herein;
   (D)   To administer oaths and affirmations, to examine witnesses, and
receive evidence;
   (E)   To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents and employees
as he or she deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter;
   (F)   To delegate any of his or her functions and powers under this chapter
and other ordinances to such officers, agents and employees as he or she
designates;
   (G)   To seek through the appropriate judicial officer or office, such
warrants that are necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter and in
pursuit of said warrants, make such oath or affirmation necessary in support
thereof;
   (H)   To keep records of all complaints received, inspection reports, orders
and of other actions taken. The records shall be made available for public
inspection upon request within a reasonable amount of time. The City Manager,
or his or her designee, shall prepare an annual report including statistics
based on the records kept;
   (I)   Inspection of public documents maintained by the City Manager, or his
or her designee, shall be allowed only after a written application is made to
the City Manager, or his or her designee. Inspection of public documents shall
be done in the presence of an authorized employee or agent of the City Manager,
or his or her designee. If copies are requested, the city may require advance
payment of a copying fee, including postage, before providing the copies to the
requestor. The city reserves the right to withhold requested documents or
redact portions of documents that may constitute an unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy;
   (J)   Under normal circumstances, public records shall be provided within
three days after receipt of a request for such records (excepting Saturdays,
Sundays and legal holidays); or, in the event that the public document is
determined to be exempt, pursuant to KRS 61.878, notification of such
determination shall be made within three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and
legal holidays). Notification shall be made in the manner provided by KRS
61.880; and
   (K)   Blanket requests for information on particular subjects without
specifying certain public documents shall not be honored. No list of
information gathered from public documents shall be provided unless such lists
are already in existence and not otherwise confidential by law.

   (B)   When a Code Enforcement Officer, based upon personal observation or
investigation, has reasonable cause to believe that a person has committed a
violation of a local government ordinance, the officer is authorized to issue a
citation to the offender. The citation shall be served by one or more of the
following methods:
      (1)   Personal service to the alleged violator;
      (2)   Leaving a copy of the citation with any person 18 years of age or
older who is on the premises, if the alleged violator is not on the premises at
the time the citation is issued;
      (3)   Mailing a copy of the citation by regular first-class mail to the
last known recorded mailing address of the alleged violator; or
      (4)   If, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the issuance of a
citation using the methods set out in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) above is
not possible, then the citation is properly served by posting a copy of the
citation in a conspicuous place on the premises.
   (C)   When authorized, a Code Enforcement Officer may, in lieu of
immediately issuing a citation, give notice that a violation can be remedied
within a specified time period. If the person to whom the notice is given fails
or refuses to remedy the violation within the time specified, the Code
Enforcement Officer is authorized to issue a citation.
   (D)   (1)   If a Code Enforcement Officer elects to give notice of violation
in lieu of immediately issuing a citation, this notice should be sent to the
offending party by regular first-class mail at the last known address of the
party.
      (2)   The notice required by this section shall be in plain language and
shall:
         (a)   Be in writing;
         (b)   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for its
identification;
         (c)   Include a statement of the reason or reasons why the notice of
violation is being issued; and

prescribed by the city and shall contain, in addition to any other information
required by ordinance or rule of the Board, the following information:
      (1)   The date and time of issuance;
      (2)   The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued;
      (3)   The date and time the offense or violation was committed;
      (4)   The facts constituting the offense or violation;
      (5)   The section of the code or number of the ordinance violated;
      (6)   The name of the Code Enforcement Officer;
      (7)   The civil fine that will be imposed for the violation if the person
does not contest the citation;
      (8)   The maximum civil fine that may be imposed if the person elects to
contest the citation;
      (9)   The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil
fine or to contest the citation; and
      (10)   A statement that if the person fails to pay the civil fine set
forth in the citation or contest the citation, within the time allowed, the
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing before the Board
to contest the citation and that the determination that a violation was
committed shall be final and the alleged violator shall be deemed to have
waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court.

   (G)   When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is issued
shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation is

requested, the person requesting the hearing shall pay an administrative

   (A)   When a hearing before the Board has been requested, the Board, through
its clerical and administrative staff, shall schedule a hearing. Not less than
seven days before the date set for the hearing, the Board shall notify the

The notice of hearing may be given by:
      (1)   Regular first-class mail;
      (2)   Certified mail, return receipt requested;
      (3)   Personal delivery; or

the prosecutor or the alleged offender. Formal rules of evidence shall not
apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the
proceedings.
   (D)   At the hearing, the Board shall determine, based on the evidence
presented, whether a violation was committed. When the Board determines that no
violation was committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered.
When the Board determines that a violation has been committed, it shall issue
an order upholding the citation and may order the offender to pay a civil fine
in an amount authorized by ordinance, or may order the offender to remedy a
continuing violation within a specified period of time to avoid the imposition
of the fine, or may order both.
   (E)   Every final order of the Board shall be reduced to writing and include
findings and conclusions reached and the date the order was issued. A copy of
the order shall be furnished to the person named in the citation. If the person
named in the citation is not present at the time a final order is issued, the
order shall be delivered to that person by regular first-class mail; certified
mail, return receipt requested; by personal delivery; or by leaving a copy of
the order at that person’s usual place of residence with any person residing
therein who is 18 years of age or older and who is informed of the contents of
the order.
   (F)   Any person requesting a hearing before the Board who fails to appear
at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have waived the
right to a hearing to contest the citation and the determination that a
violation was committed shall be final. In this event, the citation as issued
shall be deemed a final order determining that the violation was committed and
imposing the civil fine as set forth in the citation, and the person shall be
deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court.
   (G)   Notice of a final order shall be provided to the cited violator by
regular first-class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; personal
delivery; or by leaving the notice at the person’s usual place of residence
with any individual residing therein who is 18 years of age or older and who is
informed of the contents of the notice.

welfare, or if in the absence of immediate action, the effects of the violation
will be irreparable or irreversible.

SPECIAL EVENTS
§ 93.30 TITLE, PURPOSE, POLICY, INTENT AND DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Title. This subchapter shall be known as the special events ordinance.
   (B)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide for the
issuance of special event permits to regulate events on the public right-of-way
and public property of the city in the interest of public health, safety and
welfare; and to provide for fees, charges and procedures required to administer
the permit process.
   (C)   Policy. It is the policy of the city, as implemented through this
subchapter and any policies and procedures adopted hereunder, or hereinafter,
to recognize the substantial community benefits that result from special
events. These events provide cultural enrichment, promote economic vitality,
and enhance community identity and pride. They also provide opportunities for
family activities and funding for our community’s nonprofit organizations.
Therefore, the city shall endeavor to accommodate special events that are
deemed to be in the best interests of the city, its residents and guests. It is
the city’s goal to have successful special events that enrich and promote the
community and contribute to the local economy.
   (D)   Intent.
      (1)   It is the specific intent of this subchapter and any policies and
procedures adopted hereunder, or hereinafter, to place the obligation of
complying with the requirements of this subchapter upon the applicant or
organizer, and no provision hereof is intended to impose any duty upon the city
of any of its officers, employees, or agents. Nothing contained in this
subchapter or any policy or procedure adopted hereunder is intended to be or
shall be construed to create or form the basis for liability on the part of the
city, or its officers, employees, or agents, for any injury or damages
resulting from the failure on the applicant or organizer to comply with the
provisions hereof.
      (2)   Furthermore, this subchapter imposes regulatory requirements on
certain activities that are held on city streets and on city property and that
are defined as SPECIAL EVENTS. The requirements imposed by this subchapter do
not alter, supersede, or nullify any requirements contained in other statutes,
ordinances, or regulations that may also regulate special events. These
requirements shall be applied in a content neutral manner and without
discrimination as to race, religion, sex, national origin, political
affiliation or other unlawful discriminatory classification.
   (E)   Definitions.    For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      APPLICANT. The authorized officer, employee, representative, or agent of
the organization or group who completes the application and who will be the
primary contact for the special event.
      ORGANIZER. The person, business, corporation (for-profit or nonprofit),
partnership, company, association, organization or other entity responsible for
the special event to be held.
      SPECIAL EVENT.
         (a)   Any festival, carnival, walk, autocade, block party, fair,
athletic event, production, fundraiser, gala, celebration, ceremony, race,
tournament, activity, or other event to which the general public is invited to
participate or attend, that is organized, promoted, conducted, or sponsored by
the city, the county, or any other person, corporation (for-profit or
nonprofit), partnership, company, association, organization, charity, or other
entity, and which involves the use of publicly owned, leased, or controlled
property, including public right-of-way (streets and sidewalks) and/or city
services, and involves 25 or more human participants, or, in the case of events
involving fewer than 25 or more human participants, those events which involve
use of streets, sidewalks, parks, or other city property in a way that does not
comply with normal or usual traffic, pedestrian, park, or similar regulations
or controls.
         (b)   SPECIAL EVENTS shall also include the above-mentioned events
held on private property that would have a direct impact on traffic congestion
or flow to and from the event over public right-of-way or which would
appreciably impact the need for police, fire, or other public safety and
emergency services. As a general rule, any of the above-mentioned events held
on private property to which the public is invited to attend and which the
organizer expects will be attended by 500 or more persons, is presumed to have
a direct impact on public right-of-way, police, fire, and other emergency
services, and shall be deemed a special event for purposes of this subchapter.
However, events with significantly smaller attendance may also qualify under
this subchapter as a special event if they exceed their intended purpose,
reasonable occupancy, or impact on city right-of-way.
      SPONTANEOUS EVENT. A special event that is occasioned by news or affairs
coming into public knowledge fewer than 14 days before the special event.

this section, the administering agency may designate a reportable quantity for
a hazardous material in excess of the quantity determined under this section if
the administering agency determines that the higher reportable quantity is
consistent with the purposes and objectives of this section.

be construed to forbid any person on or about the facilities from using all
diligence necessary to control such release prior to the notification to the
Police/Fire Dispatch Center, especially if such efforts may result in the
containment of the release the abatement of extreme hazard to the employees or
the general public. Delays in reporting releases due to in-house notification
of off-site owners/supervisors shall not be acceptable and may result in
penalties.
      (4)   Air releases. Accidental air releases in excess of the reportable
quantities listed in Appendix A attached to Ord. O-36-88 and incorporated
herein by reference, or, if unlisted, as prescribed by division (E) above

violating the provisions set forth in division (A)(1) above shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and, in addition to or in lieu of any other penalty, the person

thereof by anyone prior to the date of the execution of sentence. Violation of
any portion of these chapter sections is punishable by a fine of not less than
$100 or more than $500 and for the removal of litter from areas designated by

negligence or repeated spills under similar conditions and where a significant
quantity of hazardous material is involved taking into account real or

however, no person shall be held responsible for more than one violation per
day where the violations occur at the same facility and are casually related.

citation shall bear a civil penalty, in accordance with the fines established
in division (E) below, the costs of abatement, or both. Each day that a
violation continues to exist after a citation has been issued in accordance
with the applicable procedures set forth in

event shall the fine exceed $10,000 for any one violation.

            1.   Whether the design, materials and color scheme of the street
furniture comport with and enhance the quality and character of the
streetscape, including nearby development and existing land uses: and

condition of access to a particular right-of-way: may deny access if a party is
not willing to comply with the city’s reasonable requirements; and may remove,
or require removal of, any facility that is not installed in compliance with
the requirements of this subchapter and charge that party for all the costs
associated with removal. Regardless of any other criteria, in the event the
placement or location of a facility in a particular area of the right-of-way
would constitute a public safety concern, the city may deny the placement of
that facility in that area or order its relocation or removal.
      (3)   In order to minimize interference with the use of the rights-of-way
by others, each party subject to this subchapter shall make reasonable efforts
to minimize the number of surface cuts made, shall make reasonable efforts to
coordinate such surface cuts with the city’s paving schedule, and, if
appropriate, shall enter into joint trenching and other arrangements with other
parties.
      (4)   Any right-of-way or public property that is disturbed or damaged
during the construction, excavation, installation, operation, maintenance or
repair of a facility shall be repaired within 60 calendar days of the
completion of those activities which caused the disturbance or damage by the
party that disturbed or damaged the rights-of-way or public property. This time
may be extended by the City Manager upon demonstration of reasonable cause by
the subject party. Reasonable cause shall include, but not be limited to,
inclement weather, natural disasters and similar emergencies, including natural
disasters and emergencies in other regions where a utility has sent local crews
to provide assistance. Reasonable cause shall also include delay due to
unforeseen public bidding complications and/or contractor nonavailability for
public utilities that are subject to state laws governing bidding and public
procurements.
      (5)   Parties subject to this subchapter shall make every reasonable
effort to stack or bundle conduit where feasible so as to occupy as little
space as possible in the right-of-way, consistent with, and to the extent
permitted by, applicable codes, standards and regulations.
      (6)   The minimum clearance of wires and cables above the rights-of-way,
and the placement of underground facilities, shall conform to applicable codes,
standards and regulations.
   (C)   Duty to maintain all property in right-of- way. All parties subject to
this subchapter shall maintain all of their facilities located in the right-of-
way in a manner that promotes the public safety. By way of example, but not
limitation, all facilities, including, but not limited to, poles and manholes,
shall be maintained in a safe condition at all times. In the event any facility
in the right-of-way endangers the public safety, the party responsible for such
facility shall take reasonable steps to rectify the situation immediately upon
notification and in accordance with this subchapter at their cost.
   (D)   Standards. All parties subject to this subchapter shall at all times
use ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted
methods and devices and utilize due diligence in performing any installation,
construction, maintenance or other work in the right-of- way.
   (E)   Relocation or removal. Pursuant to §
96.067 and consistent with the procedures and criteria contained therein, all
parties subject to this chapter shall, upon the provision of reasonable written
notice of, and at the direction of the City Manager, promptly relocate or
remove facilities, or rearrange aerial facilities, if required by a tariff,
state or federal law, a franchise agreement with the city, or for a public
purpose pursuant to this subchapter.
(1984 Code, § 96.33) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.059 EXISTING FACILITIES.
   Facilities located in the rights-of-way prior to the effective date of this
subchapter may remain in the rights-of-way and shall not be considered in
violation of this subchapter, provided the party responsible for such
facilities under this subchapter complies with the provisions of this
subchapter, including the filing of a registration statement and the payment of
any applicable franchise fee within 120 days of its effective date. The
registration statement of each party having any facilities within the rights-
of-way as of the date this subchapter is adopted shall contain a general
description of such registrant’s facilities and the types of services offered.
Upon request by the city, the party responsible for such facilities shall
provide a map or other information regarding the location of existing
facilities. In addition, upon the request of the city and in order to assist
the city with implementing or enforcing the provisions of this subchapter, each
registrant shall make available for inspection on a reasonable basis more
detailed information, if available, regarding the location of its facilities.
(1984 Code, § 96.34) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.060 REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Requirement to register. Unless otherwise indicated by this
subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any party to install, operate, construct
or maintain any facilities within the rights-of-way unless such facilities are
registered with the city by filing the registration statement required herein
and all applicable franchise fees are paid to the city.
   (B)   Registration. Any party who owns any facilities within the right-of-
way or who seeks to occupy the right-of-way to install, construct or maintain
any facilities within the rights-of-way shall file a registration statement,
which shall be filed with the City Manager on a form provided by the city. The
registration statement shall include the following information:
      (1)   The identity and legal status of the registrant, including any
affiliates who own or operate any facilities in the rights-of-way and the name,
title, address and telephone number of the individual responsible for the
accuracy of the registration statement;
      (2)   The registrant’s address, telephone number, facsimile number and
email address, as well as a local point of contact available to be contacted in
the event of an emergency;
      (3)   A general description of all facilities that the registrant will be
installing in the right- of-way;
      (4)   Upon request of the city, the registrant shall provide a detailed
inventory and map of all of its facilities installed in the city’s right-of-
way;
      (5)   A statement of the amount, if any, of any fee to which the
registrant is subject pursuant to any franchise agreement, lease or other
agreement between the registrant and the city;
      (6)   Proof that the registrant is insured in the form of a copy of a
certificate of insurance or self-insurance that is in compliance with the
insurance requirements of this subchapter or its franchise agreement; and
      (7)   If the registrant is a utility, the number of the registrant’s
certificate of authorization or license to provide utility service issued by
the Kentucky Public Service Commission, or other state or federal authority, if
any.
   (C)   Fee. In order to compensate the city for its costs in administering
this subchapter, each registrant shall submit a fee of $15 with each
registration filed with the city.
   (D)   Notice of changes. The registrant shall notify the city within 30 days
of any change in information contained in the registration statement.
   (E)   Exceptions for reseller service providers and lessees. A reseller
service provider shall not be required to register those facilities it utilizes
solely for the purpose of reselling, or those facilities it utilizes as a
lessee.
   (F)   Effect of registration. Registration does not convey legal or
equitable title to the rights-of-way, nor does it place a registrant in a
position of priority with respect to other registrants. Registration does not
excuse a party from having to obtain a franchise, lease or other agreement, if
otherwise required, or from obtaining any required or necessary agreement with
the city or other party with respect to the placement of facilities on the
city’s or another party’s facilities.
   (G)   Exceptions. The following types of facilities are not required to be
registered pursuant to this subchapter, and the party responsible for such
facilities is not otherwise required to comply with the provisions of this
subchapter expressly pertaining to registrants. However, the party responsible
for such facilities is required to comply with all remaining provisions of this
subchapter that are not expressly limited to registrants, unless otherwise
exempted:
      (1)   Newspaper stands;
      (2)   Signage;
      (3)   Facilities associated with sidewalk cafes;
      (4)   Facilities owned by the commonwealth;
      (5)   Facilities installed by the city that are not used to provide
competitive utility services;
      (6)   Temporary solid waste roll-off containers and temporary storage
units or containers; and
      (7)   Any facilities or objects that are registered in accordance with
other applicable licenses, regulations, ordinances and law.
   (H)   Rejection or cancellation of registration.
      (1)   (a)   Within ten working days of the filing of the registration
statement or the discovery of the inaccuracy of the registration statement by
the city, the City Manager shall provide written notice to any party who:
            1.   Does not possess proper authorization to occupy the rights-of-
way with facilities; or
            2.   Fails to accurately complete the registration statement.
         (b)   Such written notice shall specify the deficiency and shall
notify the party what corrective action must be taken. If the party fails to
correct the deficiency within ten days, the City Manager shall reject or cancel
the registration unless it can be shown by the party that significant steps
have been taken to correct the deficiency, upon which showing the City Manager
may provide an additional reasonable extension of time, or provide approval of
the registration contingent upon the party’s ability to correct the deficiency
to the satisfaction of the City Manager.
      (2)   A registrant who no longer continues to place, maintain or own any
facilities in the rights-of-way may cancel its registration upon providing the
city with written notice.
      (3)   Reconsideration.
         (a)   If the City Manager rejects or cancels a registration statement,
the registrant may file with the City Manager within ten days of receipt of the
notice of rejection or cancellation a written request for reconsideration,
which shall include the basis for the registrant’s position.
         (b)   The City Manager may hear any relevant evidence in deciding the
reconsideration and will notify the registrant in the event that further
information is required. The City Manager shall render a final decision in
writing within ten days of receipt of the registrant’s written request for
reconsideration or the receipt of any further evidence, whichever is later, and
will provide the registrant the basis for his or her decision.
(1984 Code, § 96.35) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.061 REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRANTS.
   In addition to the other requirements set forth herein, each registrant
shall use reasonable efforts to:
   (A)   Cooperate with other registrants and the city to reasonably minimize
traffic and other disruptions, including surface cuts, taking into account the
efficiency, aesthetics, obtrusiveness, safety and costs of the use;
   (B)   Participate in such joint planning, construction and advance
notification of right-of-way work, including, but not limited to, coordination
and consolidation of surface cut work, as currently coordinated by Planning and
Development Services of Kenton County (PDS);
   (C)   Cooperate with the city in any emergencies involving the rights-of-way
as further provided in this subchapter, including the maintenance of a 24 hour
emergency contact;
   (D)   Designate a single point of contact for all purposes hereunder, as
well as comply with such other contact and notice protocols as required by this
subchapter or as promulgated by the City Manager pursuant to this subchapter;
   (E)   Require that any party performing any work or service in the right-of-
way on behalf of said registrant will comply with all applicable provisions of
this subchapter as well any other additional local regulation pertaining to the
performance of such work, and will identify the registrant for whom such
contractor is working. Said registrant shall be responsible and liable
hereunder only to the city for any damage to the right-of-way caused by the
actions of any such subcontractor or others as if said registrant had performed
or failed to perform any such obligation; and
   (F)   Take reasonable steps to provide notice to all occupants where any
work or service which requires an encroachment permit is scheduled to be
performed and may have an adverse effect on those properties that abut the
impacted site or impedes access to those properties abutting the impacted site.
Registrants shall make a good faith attempt to notify occupants regardless of
whether the registrant holds an easement on or over the property so that
occupants know which utility to contact with questions or concerns.
(1984 Code, § 96.36) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.062 PERMITS.
   (A)   Permit required. Unless otherwise exempted by this subchapter, any
party performing an activity within the rights-of-way requires an encroachment
permit issued by the city.
   (B)   Activities which may be performed by registrants without a permit. Any
registrant maintaining a valid registration pursuant to this subchapter may
perform the following activities without a permit, unless such work will
require the registrant to block a portion of a street in a manner that
obstructs traffic:
      (1)   Installation or replacement of cable or wiring on existing above-
around utility poles;
      (2)   Repair, replacement or maintenance of existing above-ground
facilities, including poles or miniature cellular towers, in the same location
with no street, curb, apron, sod or sidewalk cuts, provided any replacement
facilities are of comparable size as the existing facilities; or
      (3)   Any work performed inside existing conduits, vaults or similar
structures that do not otherwise require an encroachment permit.
   (C)   Encroachment permit. Except for those activities authorized without a
permit by division (B) above, a registrant shall apply to the city for an
encroachment permit in order to:
      (1)   Perform any excavating, digging, cutting, boring or tunneling into,
through or under any paved street surface, curb, sidewalk, sod or apron within
the rights-of way, and said permit shall include all aspects of the anticipated
activities without the need for multiple permits;
      (2)   Perform any construction, installation, repair, replacement or
maintenance of facilities in the right-of-way; or
      (3)   Temporarily occupy the right-of-way.
   (D)   Time for application.
      (1)   An encroachment permit for the performance of non-emergency work
shall be applied for at least ten days prior to such planned activity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Manager may waive said time period for
good cause shown. The city shall approve, deny or conditionally approve a
permit application within five business days of the receipt of the application,
and in the case of a conditional approval or denial, state in writing the basis
for such determination and what conditions must be met by the applicant in
order to obtain a permit. Any work performed without proper notification shall
constitute work being done without a permit, and as such constitute a violation
of this subchapter.
      (2)   A permit issued pursuant to an emergency shall be applied for no
later than three business days after the discovery of the emergency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Manager may waive said time period for
good cause shown. Emergency work, as defined by this subchapter, may be
completed without first obtaining a permit.
   (E)   Application for permit.
      (1)   All applications for permits shall contain the following
information:
         (a)   The identity and legal status of the applicant (the party to
whom the permit is issued);
         (b)   The name, address and telephone number and email address of the
officer, agent or employee requesting the permit;
         (c)   A description of all activities covered by the permit, the
locations and estimated dates and times of commencement and completion thereof,
and a site plan where appropriate;
         (d)   The number of all surface cuts, if any, to be covered by the
permit, and the approximate dimensions of each cut;
         (e)   The name of the contractor or other entity actually performing
the work;
         (f)   The name, address and telephone number and email address of the
contact person for the contractor or other entity actually performing the work;
and
         (g)   The date by which the construction work will be complete and the
roadway surface restored.
      (2)   A single permit may be issued for multiple surface cuts or
installations, provided that no such surface cut or installation covered in a
single permit shall be more than 500 feet apart, or upon a showing by the
permit applicant that the granting of a single permit shall not significantly
affect the city’s ability to efficiently administer this subchapter.
   (F)   Fee. In order to compensate the city for its costs in administering
this subchapter, each registrant shall be assessed a fee of:
      (1)   Fifty dollars upon application for a permit authorizing a street
surface cut;
      (2)   Twenty dollars upon application for a permit authorizing a sidewalk
or bike path cut, or for a permit authorizing a bore cut; and/or
      (3)   Fifteen dollars upon application for a permit authorizing a sod
cut, for a permit authorizing the blocking of any street in a manner that
obstructs traffic, or for any other encroachment not listed above.
   (G)   Assessment. The appropriate fee shall be assessed for each category
applied for on one permit, but no applicant shall be assessed a fee of more
than $50 total per project or permit application.
   (H)   Invoice. The city shall invoice all permit fees to the applicant on a
quarterly basis, which shall be due to the city 30 days after the date of the
invoice.
   (I)   Notification of inspections. If the city knows at the time of the
issuance of the permit that it shall require an inspection pursuant to this
subchapter, it shall notify the permittee that such an inspection is required.
   (J)   Denial. The Public Works Director, in his or her reasonable
discretion, may deny or revoke an encroachment permit, or may issue a permit
that is contingent upon the applicant performing certain requirements that
shall be specified in the permit. A decision by the Public Works Director to
deny an encroachment permit application shall be based on at least one of the
following criteria:
      (1)   It significantly conflicts with the location of existing facilities
or facilities that are planned or permitted for installation, or city
improvements or facilities that are planned in that area;
      (2)   It significantly conflicts with the timing of other ongoing
activity taking place in the same area of the right-of-way or with a previously
scheduled activity;
      (3)   It conflicts with the planned grading, re-grading, construction,
reconstruction, widening or altering of any right-of-way, including streets and
sidewalks, or the construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
alteration of a public improvement, including, but not limited to, storm
sewers, sanitary sewers and street lights;
      (4)   It conflicts with an approved development plan in that geographic
area that requires all or certain types of facilities to be located in certain
locations, areas or parts of the rights-of-way;
      (5)   It is an above-ground facility other than a utility pole, fire
hydrant or street light that, because of its size, presents significant public
safety concerns or violates historic preservation guidelines, design standards
or procedures pertaining to aesthetics that are duly adopted by the city;
      (6)   It fails to take reasonable measures to disguise or cover the
facility as required by the city;
      (7)   It conflicts with a requirement contained in the applicant’s
franchise agreement;
      (8)   It is located in a type of right-of-way, such as a bicycle lane or
path, in which the city has made a determination that facilities are not to be
installed;
      (9)   It would threaten public health, safety or welfare, or otherwise
constitute a violation of the provisions of this subchapter; or
      (10)   The applicant is not otherwise in material compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter.
   (I)   Exceptions. Permits shall not be required to be obtained pursuant to
this subchapter if the facilities involved are of the following nature.
However, the party responsible for such facilities shall comply with all
remaining provisions of this subchapter, as well as any other chapter that may
apply, unless otherwise exempted:
      (1)   Newspaper stands;
      (2)   Temporary signage which complies with all other applicable laws and
regulations;
      (3)   Facilities associated with sidewalk cafes or the sale of goods or
merchandise, which are otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations;
      (4)   Facilities owned by the commonwealth;
      (5)   Facilities installed to provide new development with connections to
utility service and for which the city is provided performance and warranty
surety protection under its land development regulations;
      (6)   Facilities installed by the city that are not used to provide
competitive utility services; and
      (7)   Facilities that are registered or authorized pursuant to other
applicable licenses, permits, laws or regulations.
   (J)   Permit availability. Permits issued pursuant to this subchapter shall
be available at all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for
inspection by the City Manager or other city employees or officials upon
request.
(1984 Code, § 96.37) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.063 EMERGENCIES; POWER TO ORDER REPAIRS.
   (A)   Because emergency repairs can be disruptive to the community,
including planned business activities of residents, a registrant shall notify
the city within two business days from discovery of the emergency, via
telephone, facsimile, text, email or in-person communication with a city
official, of any event regarding its facilities already located within the
right-of-way that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed
to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to an emergency. Within three
business days of the discovery of the emergency, the registrant shall have
applied for any necessary permit and provided the city with a written
notification of said emergency, which notice shall include, at a minimum, the
time, date, location and extent of any excavation or other work performed. If
the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s facilities, the
City Manager or his or her designee shall attempt to contact that registrant
immediately.
   (B)   If the city determines that the right-of-way associated with a surface
cut has been degraded or caved in more than one-half inch below grade, and
within two years after any surface cut, it shall notify the party or parties
responsible for such degradation or cave-in of this determination and, in the
case of a clear and immediate danger or hazard to vehicular or pedestrian
traffic, the city shall order the party or parties responsible to take
immediate precautionary measures to direct vehicular or pedestrian traffic
around and away from the degradation or cave-in. In addition, the city shall
order the party or parties responsible to make necessary corrections and
repairs, which may be temporary in nature, to cure the immediate danger or
hazard within two days and perform any additional work consistent with the
issuance of any necessary permit. The city shall thereafter order the party or
parties responsible to make all necessary permanent corrections and repairs
within 90 days.
   (C)   In all other cases of degradation or cave-in, the city shall order the
party or parties responsible for such degradation or cave-in to take immediate
precautionary measures to direct vehicular or pedestrian traffic around and
away from the degradation or cave-in, and shall order the party or parties
responsible to make all necessary corrections and repairs within 30 days.
   (D)   In the event the city orders corrections or repairs pursuant to this
section, and the party responsible fails to respond within the time allotted,
the city shall cause the necessary corrections and repairs to be made, and
shall submit a statement for the costs incurred by the city in making such
corrections and repairs to the responsible party, which statement shall include
an additional administrative fee of $500. In that event, and if the said
statement of costs and fees is not paid by the responsible party within 45
days, the city shall suspend the issuance of all future permits to the
responsible party until such time as the costs are paid.
   (E)   This section shall not be interpreted to preclude the city from taking
any and all reasonable protective measures with respect to the right-of-way and
the health and safety of the general public, including, but not limited to,
blocking the general public’s access to the area, temporarily repairing the
right-of-way, or removing any facility that constitutes an immediate health or
safety concern. The city shall not undertake to repair or remove a facility
unless all other reasonable methods of response to the emergency have been
exercised.
   (F)   Any other provision in this section notwithstanding, the City Manager
may extend any time period under this section for good cause, and the requested
extension upon a showing of good cause by the applicant, shall not be
unreasonably withheld or denied. Good cause shall include, but not be limited
to, inclement weather, natural disasters and similar emergencies, including
natural disasters and emergencies in other regions where a utility has sent
local crews to provide assistance.
(1984 Code, § 96.38) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.064 INSURANCE.
   Each registrant shall maintain in full force and effect a commercial general
liability insurance policy reasonably acceptable to the city with a minimum
policy limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence and shall provide the city with a
certificate of insurance evidencing the insurance policy required by this
section. The certificate shall state that the insurance policy shall not be
canceled or non-renewed until after 30 days’ notice has been provided to the
city; however, insurance may be canceled and replaced with a policy that
continues to meet the requirements of this section. A registrant may satisfy
the insurance requirements and conditions of this section under a reasonably
acceptable self insurance plan. The city reserves the right to impose
reasonable additional insurance requirements as part of a franchise agreement.
(1984 Code, § 96.39) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.065 INDEMNIFICATION; HOLD HARMLESS.
   (A)   (1)   Consistent with state law, each registrant shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the city, its elected and appointed officials,
boards, members, agents and employees against any and all claims, suits, causes
of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or equitable relief, and costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, arising from liability or
claims of liability for bodily injury or death to persons or property damage in
which the claim arises out of the installation, construction, repair,
maintenance or operation of its facilities, and in the event of a final
judgment being obtained against the city either independently or jointly with
the registrant, the registrant shall pay such judgment with all costs and hold
the city harmless thereon.
      (2)   Within ten business days of learning of any claim, suit, cause of
action, proceeding judgement for damages or equitable relief that might trigger
the indemnification obligation, the city shall notify the registrant of the
existence of the claim, suit, cause of action, proceeding or judgment in
writing and shall provide all information known to the city regarding the same.
The registrant shall defend against the claim, suit, cause of action,
proceeding or judgment on behalf of the city and may select the counsel to
represent the city in such an action or proceeding. The city shall not agree to
any settlement or compromise for which an indemnification obligation applies
unless the registrant consents to the settlement or compromise.
   (B)   This section shall not apply to registrants which are political
subdivisions of the commonwealth, municipal corporations, special districts or
special purpose governmental entities.
(1984 Code, § 96.40) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.066 JOINT PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION; COORDINATION OF EXCAVATION.
   (A)   Any registrant owning, operating or installing facilities in the
rights-of-way that provide water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone, internet,
cable, video, cellular or other utility services, may at their discretion
prepare and submit to the City Manager a master plan or future plans for right-
of-way work in the city.
   (B)   The city shall annually prepare a listing of planned public
improvements including, but not limited to, streets, sidewalks, bike paths,
storm water improvements or other such improvements along with their
anticipated bid date. The list of planned public improvements shall be prepared
and be available at least six months prior to their intended bid date. The list
shall be provided to utilities on record as having filed a registration with
the city at that time. The list of public improvements shall also be submitted
to Planning and Development Services of the county. Implementation of planned
public improvements shall be contingent upon approval by City Commission and
the availability of necessary funding.
   (C)   Prior to applying for a permit for work involving a surface cut in the
right-of-way, a party shall review the city’s current repaving and resurfacing
and shall coordinate, to the extent practicable with each registrant, utility
and street work shown on such plan to minimize damage to, and avoid undue
disruption and interference with, the public use of the rights-of-way.
   (D)   Any item of information provided by a registrant consistent with this
subchapter which the registrant considers to be proprietary must be clearly and
conspicuously designated “proprietary” by the registrant. Any item clearly and
conspicuously designated as proprietary by the registrant shall be maintained
confidentially by the city and not publicly disclosed, disseminated or shared
with third parties without specific written consent of the registrant. Any item
not labeled proprietary shall be not be considered proprietary by the city and
may be subject to public disclosure under the state’s Open Records laws.
(1984 Code, § 96.41) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.067 INSTALLATION, RELOCATION OR DISCONTINUATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Provisions apply unless direct conflict exists. The provisions of this
section shall apply unless they directly conflict with a tariff, state or
federal law, or the provisions of the applicant’s franchise agreement with the
city. This section shall not be interpreted to impair the ability of a
registrant to perform work not requiring a permit unless a public safety
concern would arise if such work were to be performed.
   (B)   General application. Upon the written notice of and at the direction
of the City Manager, a registrant shall relocate or remove facilities, or
rearrange aerial facilities, if required by a tariff, state or federal law, a
franchise agreement with the city or the provisions of this subchapter.
   (C)   Coordination. To the extent reasonably possible, registrants shall
coordinate the installation, relocation and removal of their facilities with
each other in order to avoid issues with respect to the location of facilities
within the right-of-way.
   (D)   Procedure. The City Manager shall notify the applicant if the City
Manager determines that a facility may not be installed as requested by the
applicant. Upon determining that a facility may not be installed as requested,
the City Manager shall provide written notice to the applicant as early as
practicable and in conformity with any specific applicable notice requirement.
The notice shall contain a description of the area affected as well as the
reason for the City Manager’s determination. The City Manager may issue a
permit that is contingent upon certain condition(s) being fulfilled with
respect to the criteria contained below.
   (E)   Reservation of rights. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
subchapter, the city specifically reserves the right to order the removal or
relocation of any facility installed after the effective date of this chapter,
at no cost to the city for which the appropriate permit was not obtained.
   (F)   Preclusion on cutting newly paved surfaces.
      (1)   If any street is designated for resurfacing or reconstruction by
the city on the list maintained pursuant to this subchapter, the registrant
shall make any extensions, changes or installations of or to its facilities
ahead of such activity. The registrant shall notify the City Manager no less
than 45 days prior to the city’s anticipated bid date of its desire to perform
such extensions, changes or installations, and may be allowed up to 90
additional days to complete the work.
      (2)   If any street is about to be constructed, reconstructed, widened,
altered or paved by the city, the City Manager shall provide notice to
registrants, and the registrant shall make any extensions, changes or
installations of or to its facilities ahead of such activity. Depending on the
amount of such extensions, changes or installations to be performed, the
registrant may be allowed up to 120 days to complete the work, which the City
Manager may extend for good cause. It is expected that the registrant shall not
disturb the city’s improvements within the following two-year period, so as to
minimize the premature degradation of the right-of-way caused by multiple
alterations and surface cuts. Upon a registrant’s showing of undue hardship or
emergency, the City Manager may grant permission for limited disturbment of the
newly paved surface within the two-year period. The registrant shall in those
instances comply with all other relevant provisions of this chapter pertaining
to restoration of the right-of-way.
   (G)   Relocation.
      (1)   Generally. Upon providing reasonable advanced written notice to the
registrant or other responsible party, the City Manager may order the
relocation or rearrangement of any facility, in his or her reasonable
discretion and in good faith, if any of the following arise with respect to
that facility:
         (a)   The relocation or rearrangement is necessary for the purpose of
public safety;
         (b)   The relocation or rearrangement is required by a tariff, state
or federal law, or a franchise agreement with the city;
         (c)   The relocation or rearrangement is necessary to assist in the
installation of facilities by another registrant or permittee;
         (d)   The relocation or rearrangement is necessary as a result of the
city adopting a planned public project or policy requiring that facilities be
relocated; and
         (e)   So as to conform to the established grade or line of a right-of-
way or so as not to interfere with public improvements whenever the city shall
grade, regrade, construct, reconstruct, widen or alter any right-of-way, or
construct, reconstruct, repair, maintain or alter a public improvement,
including, but not limited to, storm sewers, or street lights therein.
      (2)   Coordination. The city shall coordinate the new location with the
registrant or permittee as part of the permitting process.
      (3)   Relocation underground. If, as a result of a planned public
project, a registrant is required to relocate facilities that were previously
and lawfully located above-ground, and the city requests, as part of the
relocation, that the facilities be relocated to underground, the city may bear
the cost for the difference in cost between an aerial and underground facility
of the same type, unless an agreement to the contrary is otherwise entered into
by the appropriate parties and unless applicable state law requires otherwise.
      (4)   Relocation for public safety reasons. If the basis for the city
ordering the relocation of a facility is a public safety concern, the
registrant shall relocate the facility at no cost to the city.
      (5)   Relocations to assist in the placement of other facilities. If a
registrant is required to relocate facilities to assist in the installation of
facilities by another registrant or permittee, the party seeking to install the
facilities shall bear the costs of said relocation, unless an agreement to the
contrary is otherwise entered into by the appropriate parties.
      (6)   Relocations where the cost is borne by the city. Notwithstanding
any language in this subchapter to the contrary, unless an agreement to the
contrary is otherwise entered into by the appropriate parties, the cost of the
following types of relocations shall be borne by the city:
         (a)   The relocation is the result of the city adopting a plan or
policy requiring that facilities be placed underground in that location, if, at
the time the facility was installed, such a plan was not in place;
         (b)   The location in which the facility is currently sited was not a
part of the right-of-way or was not otherwise owned or controlled by the city
at the time the facility was installed;
         (c)   The city has previously ordered that the facility be relocated
to comply with a public improvement project, the registrant or party has
substantially complied with such order, and the city then orders the registrant
or party to relocate that facility to a different area as part of the same
project; or
         (d)   The city orders the relocation of a facility to accommodate a
public improvement project, and the construction of such project is
subsequently terminated by the city.
   (H)   Lessees.  
      (1)   Any franchisee of the city that chooses to lease any utility pole
to another entity, or which allows any other entity to use a utility pole in
the public right-of-way, shall:
         (a)   Require in any agreement with a lessee that it will remove its
equipment from the utility pole when directed to do so by the city or by the
franchisee;
         (b)   Require removal of the lessee's equipment from the pole at the
expense of the franchisee or the lessee as the parties might agree;
         (c)   Require that the lessee give identifying information to the city
including its name, address for receiving regular U.S. mail, e-mail address,
telephone number of its office which responds to existence, installation,
repair, maintenance, and removal of equipment which exists on utility poles in
the public right-of-way;
         (d)   Require that the lessee be duly authorized to do business in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky and be subject to service of process in the
Commonwealth;
         (e)   Require that the lessee be duly authorized and licensed to do
business in the city and that it pay and stay current on all license fees and
occupational taxes in the city.
      (2)   The franchisee will contact and require its lessees to remove their
equipment from any utility pole in the public right-of-way when directed to do
so by the city and/or the franchisee.
      (3)   Any refusal or failure of a franchisee to abide by the terms of the
requirements of this section will subject the franchisee to pay any and all
expenses incurred by the city when any lessee's equipment is removed from a
utility pole in a public right of way. The expenses which the franchisee will
be required to pay will include the attorneys’ fees and any costs incurred in
defending any lawsuits brought by the lessee for removal of the equipment and
any damages of any kind, including punitive damages, from removal of the
equipment, including all damages and required by §
96.065.
      (4)   Any franchisee that leases use of utility poles in the public right
of way to other entities must keep record of any such entity, its identifying
information (as described above) which pole or poles it is using, the amount it
is paying the franchisee for use of the pole, and all other terms of the lease
for use of the pole. These records must be made available upon request by the
city.
   (I)   Discontinuance of use.
      (1)   Any party discontinuing use of a facility shall notify the City
Manager in writing of such discontinued use within 30 days. Said notice shall
describe the facilities for which the use is to be discontinued and include a
statement as to whether the registrant intends to leave the facilities in place
for potential future use, remove the facilities or abandon the facilities in
place. The registrant shall remain responsible for the maintenance, repair and
condition of discontinued facilities at all times.
      (2)   The City Manager may order that the responsible party remove,
replace or repair any discontinued facility which significantly interferes with
the city’s maintenance of the right-of-way.
(1984 Code, § 96.42) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020; Ord. O-26-22, passed 12-
20-2022)
§ 96.068 ABOVE-GROUND FACILITIES.
   The following regulations shall apply to above-ground facilities:
   (A)   To the extent possible, registrants shall use poles and conduit
existing at the time of permitting in installing above-ground facilities;
   (B)   All poles or wire holding structures are subject to any applicable,
duly adopted regulations regarding location, height, type or other pertinent
aspect;
   (C)   All transmission and distribution structures, poles and other lines
and equipment installed or erected by a registrant under this subchapter shall
be located so as to minimize any interference with the proper use of the right-
of-way with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners whose
property adjoins or abuts any affected right-of-way. Subject to applicable
codes, overhead drops shall be as close as possible to other utility drops in
order to concentrate the drops in as small an area as possible to minimize
visual clutter and interference with the use of private property; and
   (D)   The utility is responsible for the cost of compliance with safety
standards that may impact the rights and reasonable convenience of property
owners whose property adjoins or abuts any affected right-of-way.
(1984 Code, § 96.43) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.069 PATCHING AND RESTORATION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Minimum standards. Patching and restoration of the rights-of-way shall
be performed according to the applicable standards and with materials
comparable to those used by the city, and at a minimum shall comply with the
applicable standard engineering drawing. All edges of a surface cut made to a
paved street shall be sawed, and such surface cuts shall be sealed with a
sealant approved by the city. In addition, the city shall approve all backfill
material utilized.
   (B)   Additional standards. In special circumstances, the City Manager may
impose additional restoration requirements upon a determination that the
minimum patching and restoration standards are inadequate because of at least
one of the following considerations:
      (1)   The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations;
      (2)   Disruptions or damage to the right-of- way;
      (3)   The traffic volume carried by the right- of-way;
      (4)   The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; and
      (5)   The remaining life expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the
excavation.
   (C)   Guarantees. Each party performing excavations pursuant to a permit
required by this subchapter guarantees its restoration work and shall maintain
it for one year following its completion. During this period, it shall, upon
notification from the City Manager, correct all restoration work to the extent
necessary, using the method required by the City Manager.
(1984 Code, § 96.44) (Ord. O-04-20, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 96.070 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Site inspection.
      (1)   Any party issued a permit pursuant to this subchapter shall make
the worksite available to the city and to all others as authorized by law for
inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion
of the work. If the city has given the party notice of its intent to inspect
the excavation, the permittee shall provide the city with advanced notice of at
least two business days when the appropriate portion of the activity is ready
for inspection. If the permittee was not notified of the city’s intent to
inspect the excavation site as a condition of the permit or the city failed to
inspect after being provided the required notice, the excavation may be
permanently covered.
      (2)   Any excavation with a required approval or inspection that has been
covered prior to the two-day notification period shall be uncovered for
inspection at that permittee’s expense, upon request of the city.
      (3)   If the construction or restoration does not meet the standards
under this chapter, the city may order reasonable corrective measures.
   (B)   Authority of the City Manager.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the City Manager may order the immediate
cessation of any work that he or she in good faith believes poses a serious
threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The City Manager may issue an order to the permittee for any work
that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable ordinance,
resolution, regulation, standard, condition or code. The order shall state that
failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit.
The permittee shall proceed with the corrective work before undertaking any
additional work under the permit. Within 30 days after issuance of the order,
the permittee shall present proof to the City Manager that the violation has
been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time,
the City Manager may revoke the permit, or for good cause shown, extend the
period of time allowed for the corrective work to be completed.

   (A)   (1)   No person or entity shall place tables or seating for tables
(hereinafter collectively “seating”) on the public right-of-way, including
public sidewalks, (hereafter “public sidewalks”) unless that person first has
obtained a license for the tables and seating from the City Manager, or his or
her designee, (hereafter collectively “City Manager”) and has had such seating
approved by the City Engineer. This license must be obtained for all tables and
seating on public sidewalks or plazas (“the licensed premises”) and this
license shall be automatically renewed on an annual basis upon the payment of
the annual fee as set forth in division (G) below. The City Manager is
authorized to promulgate written regulations that define appropriate seating.
      (2)   Licenses for tables and seating shall only be issued for areas
located throughout the city that are designated “commercial” zones as indicated
in Article 3 of the Zoning Ordinance, and the ART Zones as indicated in Article
4 of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   Licenses for tables and seating shall only be issued for tables and
seating that are of a design, size and scale appropriate to the character of
the neighborhood in which the tables are to be located. The City Manager shall
be empowered to enforce this provision, using the Historic Covington Design
Guidelines or other guidelines as approved and maintained by the Community
Development Department as a guide to making such a determination.
      (4)   Licenses for tables and seating may only be permitted in locations
on the public right- of-way that are deemed appropriate by the City Manager.
The City Manager may refuse to grant a license that he or she believes may be
injurious to the health, safety and well-being of the pedestrians and the
general public, causes noncompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act,
blocks or inhibits vehicle sightlines or creates a public nuisance, as defined
by the city’s nuisance ordinance. No license shall be issued to an applicant
that is not current on his, her or its obligations to the city, including
taxes, loans, liens and unremediated violations of the city building or
nuisance codes.
   (B)   The license shall specify the number of tables and chairs and the
specific location of the tables and seating. The licensee shall place the
tables and seating only in the areas designated in the license. The applicant
shall provide the following to the City Manager before qualifying for the
issuance of a license:
      (1)   The name of the applicant, including the type of organization,
e.g., proprietorship, partnership, corporation, limited liability company and
the person responsible for compliance with this subchapter;
      (2)   The address of the applicant; and
      (3)   A map or diagram drawn to scale depicting the number, type and
dimensions of tables and seating. The map shall illustrate the width of the
sidewalk and specifically identify where the tables and seating or benches will

license granted by the City Manager:
      (1)   Inclusion of a release and indemnification provision releasing and
indemnifying the city from personal injury and property damage liability
resulting from the use of the tables and seating;
      (2)   Certification that the applicant will provide adequate trash
receptacles outdoors for the tables and seating and certification that the
applicant will empty these receptacles at reasonable time intervals to ensure
that the receptacles do not overflow with trash and debris onto the public
right-of-way;
      (3)   Certification that the licensee will clean the right-of-way on
which tables and seating are placed, including sidewalks and abutting curbs and
gutters, of all litter and debris each night after outdoor service is finished;
      (4)   Certification that the license will permit outdoor service until
12:45 a.m. with all outside seating prohibited after 1:00 a.m. every night of
the week. An exception shall be the public plaza around the Goose Girl
Fountain, where on Sunday through Thursday, the license will permit outdoor
service until 10:45 p.m. with all outside seating prohibited after 11:00 p.m.,
and on Friday and Saturday nights, the license will permit outdoor service
until 11:45 p.m. with all outside seating prohibited after 12:00 a.m. midnight;

plazas, whether live or amplified by outdoor speakers, will comply with the
city's noise ordinance codified at §
92.07.
      (6)   Certification that the applicant is the owner of the property
abutting the sidewalk, or if a lessee of the property, a certification of
ownership from the lessee’s landlord must be submitted;
      (7)   (a)   The licensee, at its sole expense, shall maintain
comprehensive general liability insurance, protecting against all claims for
personal injury, death or property damage occurring upon, in or about the
licensed premises resulting from the use of occupancy thereof, with a minimum
of $50,000 in coverage and limits acceptable to the city for the entire term of
the license agreement and any extension thereof. The city must be named in this
policy as an additional insured entity; and
         (b)   The licensee shall include copies of all policies of insurance
with evidence of the payment of the premiums thereon with his, her or its
application. A licensee shall deliver to the city at least ten days prior to
the expiration of such policy, evidence that it has been renewed. All policies
of insurance carried hereunder shall provide that they cannot be canceled
without giving at least ten days’ prior written notice to the city and shall be
written by insurance companies licensed by the commonwealth and reasonably
satisfactory to the city. Any insurance carried by a licensee on his, her or
its own property or for his, her or its own benefit in connection with this
section shall contain a clause waiving any claim by the insurance company for
subrogation against the city.
      (8)   The licensee shall ensure that no part of the right-of-way,
sidewalk or curb is damaged by his, her or its outdoor seating, including
prevention of stains on sidewalks and curbs caused by the seating. The licensee
shall refrain from using any harsh or damaging chemicals to clean any stamped
concrete sidewalks or surfaces upon which tables or seating is placed. The
licensee further agrees that any damage caused to a city right-of-way, sidewalk
or curb by the licensee’s seating will be repaired or repair costs reimbursed
by the licensee;
      (9)   The licensee shall maintain the right-of-way used for outdoor
dining during the winter months (November to February), including cleaning the
paved surface, and shall ensure that all seating is removed from the sidewalk
during these months when not in use; and
      (10)   Any other information reasonably required by the City Manager to
properly administer the intent of this subchapter.
   (D)   A four-foot pedestrian way shall be kept clear through the licensed
premises at all times (“pedestrian easement”). Tables and seating shall not be
allowed in this pedestrian easement. Service and consumption of the licensee’s
food and drink shall be allowed only to those who are seated in the licensed
premises. All seating must accompany tables. Tables and chairs may be moved
together to allow patrons to sit together so long as the pedestrian way is
maintained. This requirement shall be strictly enforced.
   (E)   No alcoholic beverages shall be served or consumed on the public
sidewalk, unless the portion of the public sidewalk where the permitted tables
and seating are located is included in the “licensed premises” for a licensed
liquor by the drink restaurant, tavern or dining facility as approved by the
City Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator and the State Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control or otherwise allowed by law and the license holder
enters into a separate license agreement with the city.
   (F)   It shall be the responsibility of the licensee to maintain the
licensed premises in orderly fashion, including requiring that all persons
within the licensed premises behave in an orderly fashion and not generate
excessive noise. This requirement shall be strictly enforced.
   (G)   The cost of the license shall be $20 per two-top table and $40 per
four-top table annually for tables placed on public sidewalks or plazas.
Payment shall be made to the office of the City Manager by December 1 of each
year for the following calendar year. Upon issuance of a license agreement by
the city and payment of the annual license fee by the licensee, the licensee
shall be permitted to place tables and seating on the public sidewalks on a
continuous basis from March 1 until October 31. Tables and seating may not be
placed on public sidewalks on a continuous basis from November 1 until February
28. If the licensee makes improvements to the sidewalk and curbs adjacent to
his, her or its business, has obtained a revocable easement from the city for
this area, and receives permission of the city to construct such improvements,
then the licensee may apply to the City Manager to have these fees waived on a
yearly basis, up to the actual amount paid for the construction of the
improvements. These fees may be waived for a maximum period of three years,
commencing from the completion date of the improvement.
   (H)   Any license issued by the city to allow for placement of tables and
seating on the public sidewalks shall not be assigned or transferred to third
party without the prior written consent of the City Manager.
   (I)   A license may be revoked by the city upon seven days’ written notice
upon a finding by the City Manager that the licensee has violated any terms of
this section, has failed to abide by the terms or conditions set forth in the
license or upon a finding by the City Manager that the licensee has violated
city ordinances or state or federal law. A license may also be revoked by the
City Manager if the licensed establishment has two or more convictions for
violating the city’s noise control ordinance within a 12-month period, or the
licensee or an employee of the establishment has been convicted of serving
alcohol to a minor. If a license is revoked, the licensee shall not be eligible
to reapply for a license until one year has passed from the date of the license
revocation. The licensee may appeal this revocation to the City Board of
Commissioners within seven days of the notice of revocation. If a former
licensee fails to appeal a license revocation within the time frame set forth
herein, such decision shall not be subject to further review.

§ 110.04 EXEMPTED ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   Non-profit organizations, as determined by the Internal Revenue
Service approval of not-for-profit status, must file an application for a
business regulatory license, but are exempt from the $30 administrative cost
associated with this filing. Upon the filing of an application by a non-profit
organization and confirmation of its not-for-profit status, the Finance
Department will issue a business regulatory license certificate to this
organization.
   (B)   The following business entities are exempt under state law from the
occupational license tax and are not required to file a city occupational
license return (“Form OL-3” or “OL-3”), except as otherwise noted:
      (1)   Public service corporations that pay an ad valorem tax on property
valued and assessed by the state’s Department of Revenue, pursuant to the
provisions of KRS 136.120. To be entitled to this exemption, companies are
required to show that they are actually assessed as public service companies by
the state’s Revenue Cabinet and that they in fact pay an ad valorem tax based
on this assessment. Licensees whose businesses are predominantly non-public
service, but who are also engaged in public service activity are required to
pay a license tax on their net profits derived from the non-public service
activities apportioned to the city;
      (2)   Life insurance companies incorporated under the laws of and doing
business in the commonwealth (see KRS 136.320(4), (5)); and
      (3)   Banks, trust companies, combined bank and trust companies, combined
trust, banking and title businesses, and savings and loan associations, whether
state or federally chartered, that are expressly exempted by KRS 92.300.
   (C)   The following business entities are exempt from the net profit
occupational license tax, but are required to file a Form OL-3:
      (1)   Any business entity engaged in the letting or rental of any
dwelling unit in the city that owns no more than one dwelling unit for lease in
the city and whose rents from all dwelling units owned, whether within or
outside the city when taken together, do not exceed $6,000;
      (2)   Persons whose sole business activity is the manufacture of and/or
sale of alcoholic beverages. Persons engaged in the business of manufacturing
and/or selling alcoholic beverages are required to file a return, but may
exclude the portion of their net profits derived from such manufacturing and/or
sale of alcoholic beverages; and
      (3)   Any usual activities of boards of trade, chambers of commerce,
trade associations or unions, community chest funds or foundations;
corporations or associations organized and operated exclusively for religious,
charitable, scientific, literary, educational or civic purposes, or for the
prevention of cruelty to children or animal; or clubs or fraternal
organizations operated exclusively for social, literary, educational or
fraternal purposes where no part of the income or receipts of such units,
groups or associations inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or
individual. To qualify for this exemption, the organization must submit
satisfactory proof of their exempt status for federal income tax purposes. If
any part of the earnings of such business inures to the benefit of any person,
it shall be sufficient to defeat the exemption. If an organization earns
“unrelated business income”, as defined and administered in I.R.C. § 511, a net
profit license tax is assessed on the “unrelated business income”.
   (D)   The following persons are exempt from the employee occupational
license tax:
      (1)   Persons whose sole wages, salaries, commissions or other wages and
other compensations earned in the city are derived from service as members of
the Kentucky National Guard for active duty training, unit training assemblies
and annual field training;
      (2)   Compensation received by persons who have been ordained in
accordance with the ceremonial ritual or discipline of a recognized church,
religious sect or other religious organization, for the purpose of teaching and
preaching such organization’s doctrines or administering its rights and public
worship, and who customarily performs one or more of these duties; provided
that, no such person is exempt from the payment of an employee license tax on
wages and other compensation earned in activities not connected with the
regular functions of a religious organization;
      (3)   Compensation received by precinct workers for election training or
work at election booths in state, county and local primary, regular or special
elections; and
      (4)    Compensation received by an employee who works both within and
without the city if the employee is physically located within the city while on
the job for 5% or less of the time the employee is on the job in any calendar
year.

§ 110.05 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) below, net profit shall be
apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) below, plus
the sales factor, described in division (C) below, and the denominator of which
is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) below.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period:
      (1)   The sale, lease or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States Government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity; and
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit (“alternate apportionment method”).
The city must approve any alternate apportionment method prior to its
implementation by the business entity. Once an alternate apportionment method
is approved by the city, the business entity must apply such apportionment
scheme in all future tax years, unless otherwise directed by the city.
   (E)   All partnerships, S corporations, limited liability companies and all
other entities where income is “passed through” to the owners are subject to
this chapter. The occupational license tax imposed in this subchapter is
assessed against income before it is “passed through” these entities to the
owners.
   (F)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and the entity shall employ the same methods of accounting

performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage of compensation for
work performed or services rendered within the city as it bears to the total
wages and compensation paid or payable. For the city to verify the accuracy of
a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this division (C), the taxpayer shall
maintain adequate records.
   (D)   Subject to division (E) below, at a minimum, every employer required
to deduct and withhold tax under this section shall make a return and report to

section on a quarterly basis, on or before January 30, April 30, July 30 and
October 30 following the withholding period.
   (E)   For each employer who employs persons within the city for which the
occupational license tax is required to be withheld from all employee
compensation and the amount withheld by the employer exceeds $450 for any one
of the preceding four quarters, the employer shall remit the occupational
license tax required to be withheld from employees on a monthly basis, with

accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (G)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold these sums,
the lien shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed
by the city.

federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax statements, or a
detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the city, shall be submitted.

with an employee leasing arrangement shall include a separate annual report of
earnings for each client or co-employer listing the client’s or co-employer’s
name, address and telephone number.

January 31 of each year, showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee
for payment to the city during the preceding calendar year.

that liability; provided that, the personal and individual liability shall
apply to each and every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax
becomes or became obligated.
   (L)   Notwithstanding divisions (F) and (J) above, every employee receiving
compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
110.03 of this chapter shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all
cases where the employer does not withhold the tax levied under this subchapter

110.04 of this chapter, every business entity and employer required to obtain
an occupational license from the city shall file for the preceding taxable year
a Form OL-3, properly signed and completed in proper detail, regardless of
whether income is realized, a license tax liability exists or the business is
actively engaged during the tax year. The return is due on April 15 of each
year, except returns made on the basis of a fiscal year, which shall be made by
the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the fiscal year.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its
occupational license return with the city. Whenever, in the opinion of the
city, it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return of any business
entity to audit the return, the city may compel the business entity to produce
for inspection a copy of any statements and schedules in support thereof that
have not been previously filed. The city may also require copies of reports of
adjustments made by the federal government and/or other financial documents
maintained by the business entity.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this subchapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns and comply with rules and regulations as the city from
time to time may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may
require a business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a
return, render statements under oath or keep records, as the city deems
sufficient to determine the tax liability of the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the taxable income
of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business
entity or of any other person having knowledge of the business entity or in the
premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity, as
appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the city at the time the
occupational license tax return is filed with the city.

Department is not filed by an employer and/or the license taxes are not paid to
the city by such employer, the employee for whom no return has been filed and/
or no payment has been made shall file a request for refund of earnings tax or
additional payment due (“Form OL-1” or “OL-1”) with the city’s Finance
Department on or before January 31, annually, showing in the return his or her
compensation subject to the license tax during the preceding calendar year. The
employee submitting the Form OL-1 shall provide the original copy of the
statement furnished him or her by his or her employer. This statement must show
all of the compensation earned by him or her, wherever employed, during the
period for which such return is made. In addition to the compensation earned by
him or her, such return shall show such other pertinent information as may be
required by the city’s Finance Department. Each person making a return required
by this section shall at the time of filing the appropriate form pay the city
the amount of license tax due under this subchapter; provided that, any portion
of the license tax deducted by the employer shall be credited on the OL-
1 return and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing said return. The amount of any license taxes that were due in each year,
as provided in this subchapter, shall bear interest from the date the same
became due at the rate of 1% per month, or fraction thereof for partial months,
until paid, and the employer failing to pay the same when due shall also pay
the penalty imposed under §

or business entities that are not employees.

information in such a manner as not to reveal data respecting net profits or
compensation of any person or business entity.
   (C)   In addition, the city is empowered to execute similar reciprocity
agreements as described in division (B) above with any other taxing entity

one of the front wheels by a flexible and permanently attached driving
mechanism. There shall also be allowed an electronic timing mechanism to
operate when said vehicle is not in motion to register waiting time. They shall

to denote when the vehicle is employed and when it is not employed and it shall
be the duty of the driver to throw the flag of such meter into a non-recording
position at the termination of each trip. It shall be unlawful for the driver

§ 120.01 PURPOSE; FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations of sexually-oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of
this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually-
oriented materials. Similarly, it is no the intent nor effect of this chapter
to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected
by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually-oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent, nor effect, of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution
of obscene material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearing and in reports made
available to the City Commission, and on findings incorporated in the cases of
City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41(1986), Young v. American
Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. 501 U.S.
560 (1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to,
Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the
Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group On the Regulation of Sexually-
oriented Businesses, (6-6-1989, State of Minnesota), the Commission finds:
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises;
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually-oriented businesses defined in §
120.02 of this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments;
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually-oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows;
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions;
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually-oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually-oriented businesses;
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually-oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections;
      (7)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts;
      (8)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually- oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities;
      (9)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually-oriented businesses where persons view “adult” oriented
films;
      (10)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(9) above raise
substantial governmental concerns;
      (11)   Sexually-oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns;
      (12)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually-oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore non- existent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually operated business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually- oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein;
      (13)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters;
      (14)   Clear view of the sexually-oriented business’s premises public
area advances a substantial government interest in curbing the illegal and
unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually- oriented businesses,
excluding adult motels;
      (15)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments;
      (16)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually-
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases;
      (17)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity;
      (18)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter;
      (19)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually-transmitted diseases; and
      (20)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

for issuance of the license or has falsely answered a question or request for

person or persons to whom it is granted, the expiration date, the address of
the sexually-oriented business and the classification for which the license is
issued pursuant to §
120.03 of this chapter. All licenses shall be posted in a conspicuous place at
or near the entrance to the sexually-oriented business so that they may be
easily read at any time. The information given by an employee of a sexually-
oriented business in the application process including the employee’s mailing
address, residential address, driver’s license number, Social Security number
(or EIN), telephone number, date and place of birth or other information which
would enable third parties to determine the residence of the employee, shall be

department keeping such records as confidential and exempt from disclosure

§ 120.11 APPEALS OF DENIAL, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATIONS.
   (A)   If the city, by act of the Finance Director or City Manager, refuses
an application or a renewal of an application of a sexually-oriented business

if the city, by act of the City Manager, suspends or revokes a sexually-
oriented business license or sexually-oriented business employee license, the
City Manager shall advise the applicant or the license holder in writing of the
denial, suspension or revocation, as the case may be, setting forth in writing
the specific reasons for the action with a citation of the ordinance section
which is the basis for the denial, suspension or revocation. Notice of the
denial, suspension or revocation shall be served by registered mail or
according to the state’s rules of civil procedure. The notice shall advise the
applicant or license holder of the right to appeal within 15 days of receipt of
service the decision/action to the Mayor and Board of Commissioners.
   (B)   Immediately upon the applicant’s appeal to the Mayor and Board of
Commissioners, the city shall issue a temporary license to operate a sexually-
oriented business or to work as a sexually-oriented business employee. This
temporary license shall remain in effect throughout the final judicial review
and the final decision on the denial, suspension or revocation. Upon appeal by

shall ensure the following due process guarantees.
      (1)   At appropriate stages of proceedings, the parties shall be given
full opportunity to file pleadings, motions, objections, offers of settlement,
briefs, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and proposed
recommended or final orders. The original of all filings shall be mailed to the

by mail. The Clerk shall, when any filing is received, mark the document as
received.

evidence.
      (4)   The proceedings shall guarantee that any party may participate in
person or be represented by counsel.
      (5)   If a party fails to attend or participate in any hearing or other
stages of the process or fails to comply with any order of the Mayor and Board
of Commissioners, the Mayor and Board of Commissioners may adjourn the
proceedings and issue a default order granting or denying relief as appropriate
or may conduct the proceedings without the participation of the defaulting
party, having due regard for the interest of justice and the orderly and prompt
conduct of the proceedings.
      (6)   The proceedings shall be open to the public.
      (7)   After the taking of evidence and argument of the parties or
counsel, the Mayor and Board of Commissioners shall prepare findings of fact
and conclusions of law and order either sustaining the decision/action of the
City Manager, or sustaining the appeal of the applicant or license holder, or
modifying the decision of the City Manager as they deem appropriate.
      (8)   The Mayor and Board of Commissioners shall make their findings of
fact based exclusively on the evidence of record, and hearsay evidence may be
admissible if it is the type of evidence that reasonable and prudent persons
would rely on in their daily affairs, but it shall not be sufficient in itself
to support a finding of fact unless it would be admissible over objections in
civil actions.
      (9)   All testimony shall be made under oath or affirmation.
      (10)   The Mayor and Board of Commissioners shall cause all testimony,
motions and objections in a hearing to be accurately and completely recorded.
Any person, upon request and upon payment of the costs of copying, may receive
a copy of the recording or a copy of the transcript if the hearing has been
transcribed. The city shall have the burden to show the propriety of the
decision/action taken against the applicant or license holder. The party
asserting any affirmative defense has the burden to establish that defense. The
ultimate burden of persuasion is met by a preponderance of evidence in the
record.
      (11)   A licensee (applicant or license holder) may appeal an adverse
decision of the Mayor and Board of Commissioners. The city shall take no action
to enforce a decision to deny a license application or enforce a suspension or
revocation of a licensee’s license during the 15-day period granted by this
section to appeal the adverse administrative decision to the Mayor and the
Board of Commissioners, or during the proceedings before the Mayor and Board of
Commissioners. After a decision by the Mayor and Board of Commissioners
suspending or revoking the license, the order may be enforced.
      (12)   If a licensee (applicant or license holder) appeals a decision of
suspension or revocation to the county’s Circuit Court or court of competent
jurisdiction, the enforcement of the adverse decision shall be stayed pending a
final decision of the court or interim order temporarily enforcing the adverse
order of denial, suspension or revocation.

factor as to whether a business will remain or locate in the city.
   (B)   The city’s objective for offering economic development incentives
shall be to encourage the expansion of commerce to businesses demonstrating a
long-term commitment to the community by:
      (1)   Creating and retaining quality, value-added (primary) jobs;
      (2)   Broadening and diversifying the city’s tax base;
      (3)   Encouraging capital investments;
      (4)   Increasing the city’s global competitiveness; and
      (5)   Promoting the growth and wellbeing of the city.

§ 125.01 PURPOSE; FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. This chapter is an exercise of the city’s police power for
the public safety, health and welfare; and its provisions shall be liberally
construed to accomplish this purpose.
   (B)   Findings and intent. Medical and mental health experts have denounced
efforts to change sexual orientation and gender identity as ineffective and
unsafe for people, especially minors. These efforts are based on the
discredited premise that being non-heterosexual is a mental disorder that can
be corrected or cured. It is the intent of the Board of Commissioners that
these unethical conversion treatments that correlate with serious and dangerous
harm to the health and well-being of minors be prohibited. Therefore, the Board
finds and declares that a compelling and important interest exists in
protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors from efforts to
change sexual orientation and gender identity within the municipality through
the professional conduct of licensed providers, and no other less intrusive
means of protecting minors from the harms associated with conversion therapy
would be effective in furthering the city’s interest.

individual would have a justified reasonable concern for safety, security and

concern for personal security due to congestion and close proximity to others;
      (3)   Areas within 20 feet of access to building entrances, public events

would have a reasonable, justified concern for personal security due to

reasonable, justified concern for personal security due to congestion and close
proximity to others.
   AREAS WITH HEIGHTENED PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. Includes the traffic or travel
lane of any public streets or highways open to vehicular traffic within the
city, with the definition of traffic or travel lane to include any entrances or
exits from any street or highway or interstate, the shoulders, curbs, gutters,

outside of the traffic or travel lanes, but not including sidewalks, and areas
with heightened public safety concerns shall also include traffic medians of

Includes the definition of soliciting for charitable or political purposes,
begging or panhandling set out in this division (A), but only such conduct that

oral requests for contributions or other activities that do not constitute or
fall within the definition of aggressive panhandling, begging, charitable and

   SOLICITING (SOLICIT) FOR CHARITABLE OR POLITICAL PURPOSES, BEGGING (BEG) OR

   (B)   Aggressive solicitation prohibited. No person shall engage in
aggressive panhandling, begging, charitable and political solicitation at any
time or any location in the city.
   (C)   Passive solicitation regulated.
      (1)   The Board of Commissioners finds that passive panhandling, begging,
charitable and political solicitation as defined in this section is speech
protected under the First Amendment unless other well-grounded governmental
concerns are implicated. Passive panhandling, begging, charitable and political
solicitation in the traffic or travel lanes of public streets and highways or
in traffic medians within those public streets or highways is inherently
dangerous, is distracting to both pedestrians and drivers of motor vehicles,
gives rise to an increased risk of injury to pedestrians and the motor vehicle
occupants, interferes with the free flow of traffic and potentially threatens
the safety and well-being of nearby third parties. The traffic or travel lanes
of public streets and highways and the medians within those public streets and
highways are not designed for and are not an appropriate location for anything
other than travel. This section provides ample alternative sites for passive
panhandling, begging, charitable and political solicitation in areas that do
not give rise to enhanced public safety concerns, personal privacy concerns and
personal security concerns. Accordingly, passive panhandling, begging,
charitable and political solicitation is permitted in the city except as
otherwise prohibited below.
      (2)   Passive panhandling, begging, charitable and political solicitation
is prohibited in areas defined as areas with heightened personal security
concerns, areas with heightened personal privacy concerns and areas with
heightened public safety concerns. For the purposes of this division (C),
passive panhandling, begging, charitable and political solicitation
specifically includes an attempt by a pedestrian to enter into an area with
heightened public safety concerns in order to exchange or attempt to exchange
any item with the occupant of a motor vehicle while the vehicle is located in
areas with heightened public safety concerns as defined in division (A) above
and any solicitation is prohibited by both the solicitor and the occupant of
the motor vehicle. Passive panhandling, begging, charitable and political
solicitation is allowed on areas of sidewalks not otherwise prohibited by this
section, but no such solicitation may include any attempts to solicit in areas
with heightened public safety concerns.

132.99
§ 132.03 ERRONEOUS ACTIVATION OF SECURITY ALARM.
   (A)   No person who owns or controls premises shall permit a security alarm
system to be erroneously activated on the premises. There is hereby established
a fee, charge and penalty of $25 for each erroneous activation of a security
alarm system located in the city, except for the first two erroneous
activations thereof in each calendar month and except for the erroneous
activations thereof which result from natural causes over which the owners and
operators of such systems have no control.
   (B)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of such erroneous
activations or false alarms and certify copies thereof to the Finance Director
each month. The Finance Director shall thereupon send a bill for the
appropriate charges to the person or company who controls the premises upon
which the alarm system is located. Upon non-payment of the bill for a period of
30 days, the respective alarm systems shall be removed from the police
dispatcher’s office, if so connected, and the person or company shall be cited
to District Court for violation of this section.
   (C)   Any person who engages in the occupation of the installation of
security alarms shall install or cause to be installed a security alarm without
first notifying the person who owns or controls the premises upon which the
security alarm is to be installed of the provisions of this section.
Notification shall include providing a copy of this section or including the
provisions of this section in any contract between the installing company and
the person who owns or controls the premises upon which the security alarm is
to be installed.

he or she may designate an agent upon whom service of process may be made in
the state. The agent shall be a resident of the state or a corporation
authorized to do business in the state. The designation shall be in writing and
filed with the Secretary of State. If no designation is made and filed or if
process cannot be served in the state upon the designated agent, process may be
served upon the Secretary of State, but service upon him or her is not
effective unless the plaintiff or petitioner forthwith mails a copy of the
process and pleading by registered or certified mail to the defendant or
respondent at his or her last reasonably ascertainable address. An affidavit of
compliance with this section shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court on or
before the return day of the process, if any, or within any further time the

then- existing damage to the unit which would be the basis for a charge against
the security deposit and the estimated dollar cost of repairing such damage.
The tenant shall have the right to inspect the premises to ascertain the
accuracy of such listing prior to taking occupancy. The landlord and the tenant
shall sign the listing, which signatures shall be conclusive evidence of the
accuracy of such listing, but shall not be construed to be conclusive to latent
defects. If the tenant shall refuse to sign such listing, he or she shall state

cost of repairing such damage. The tenant shall then have the right to inspect
the premises to ascertain the accuracy of such listing. The landlord and the
tenant shall sign the listing, which signatures shall be conclusive evidence of
the accuracy of such listing. If the tenant shall refuse to sign such listing,
he or she shall state specifically in writing the items on the list to which he
or she dissents, and shall sign such statement of dissent.

pursuant to division (C) above may bring an action in District Court. Tenant’s
claim shall be limited to those items from which the tenant specifically
dissented in accordance with the provisions of division (C) above, or except as
otherwise provided, and if the tenant shall fail to sign the listing or
specifically dissent in accordance with division (C) above, the tenant shall
not be entitled to recover any damages under this section.
   (F)   In the event a tenant leaves not paying his or her last month’s rent
and does not demand a return of his or her deposit, the landlord may, after 30
days, remove the deposit from the account and apply any such excess to the debt
owing.
   (G)   In the event the tenant leaves not owing rent and having any refund
due, the landlord shall send notification to the last known or reasonably
determinable address, of the amount of any refund due the tenant. In the event
the landlord shall not have received a response from the tenant within 60 days

or in an action for rent when the tenant is in possession, the tenant may
counterclaim for any amount he or she may recover under the rental agreement of
§

tenant to pay into court all or part of the rent accrued and thereafter
accruing, and shall determine the amount due to each party. The party to whom a
net amount is owed shall be paid first from the money paid into court, and the
balance by the other party.
      (2)   If no rent remains due after application of this section, judgment
shall be entered for the tenant in the action for possession. If the defense or
counterclaim by the tenant is without merit and is not raised in good faith,
the landlord may recover reasonable attorney’s fees.
   (B)   In an action for rent when the tenant is not in possession, he or she
may counterclaim as provided in division (A) above, but is not required to pay
any rent into court.

that enjoyment of the dwelling unit is substantially impaired, the tenant or
the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon 14 days’ notice; however,
the tenant may immediately vacate the premises.
   (B)   (1)   If the rental agreement is terminated under provision of this
section, the landlord shall return all the unused portion of the prepaid rent.
      (2)   Accounting for rent in the event of termination or apportionment
shall be made as of the date of the casualty.

§ 153.43 TENANT’S REMEDIES FOR UNLAWFUL OUSTER, EXCLUSION OR DIMINUTION OF

agreement and, in either case, recover an amount not more than three months
periodic rent and a reasonable attorney’s fee. If the rental agreement is

§ 153.44 TENANT’S NON-COMPLIANCE WITH RENTAL AGREEMENT; FAILURE TO PAY RENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material non-
compliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or a material non-compliance
with §
153.43 of this chapter or this section, the landlord may deliver a written
notice to the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach
and that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 14 days
after receipt of the notice. If the breach is not remedied in 15 days, the
rental agreement shall terminate as provided in the notice subject to the
following. If the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or
otherwise and the tenant adequately remedies the breach before the date
specified in the notice, the rental agreement shall not terminate. If
substantially the same act or omission which constituted a prior non-compliance
of which notice was given recurs within six months, the landlord may terminate
the rental agreement upon at least 14 days’ written notice specifying the
breach and the date of termination of the rental agreement.
   (B)   If rent is unpaid when due and the tenant fails to pay rent within
seven days after written notice by the landlord of non-payment and his or her
intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that
period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement.
   (C)   Except as provided in this chapter, the landlord may recover damages
and obtain injunctive relief for any non-compliance by the tenant with the
rental agreement or §§
153.34 or
153.35 of this chapter. If the tenant’s non-compliance is willful, the landlord
may recover actual damages and reasonable attorney’s fees.
(KRS 383.660) (1984 Code, § 153.31) (Ord. O-29-85, passed 5-29-1985)
§ 153.45 TENANT’S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN.
   If there is non-compliance by the tenant with §§
153.34 or
153.35 materially affecting health and safety that can be remedied by repair,
replacement of a damaged item or cleaning, and the tenant fails to comply as
promptly as conditions require in case of emergency or within 14 days after
written notice by the landlord specifying the breach and requesting that the
tenant remedy it within that period of time, the landlord may enter the
dwelling unit and cause the work to be done in a professional manner and submit
the itemized bill for the actual and reasonable cost or the fair and reasonable
value thereof as rent on the next date periodic rent is due, or if the rental
agreement has terminated, for immediate payment.
(KRS 383.665) (1984 Code, § 153.32) (Ord. O-29-85, passed 5-29-1985)

   (A)   If the rental agreement requires the tenant to give notice to the
landlord of an anticipated extended absence in excess of seven days as required
in §
153.36 of this chapter and the tenant willfully fails to do so, the landlord
may recover actual damages from the tenant.
   (B)   During any absence of the tenant in excess of seven days, the landlord
may enter the dwelling unit at times reasonably necessary.
   (C)   If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make
reasonable efforts to rent it at a fair rental. If the landlord rents the
dwelling unit for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental
agreement, it terminates as of the date of the new tenancy. If the landlord
fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental or
if the landlord accepts the abandonment as a surrender, the rental agreement is
deemed to be terminated by the landlord as of the date the landlord has notice
of the abandonment. If the tenancy is from month-to-month or week-to-week, the
term of the rental agreement for this purpose is deemed to be a month or a
week, as the case may be.
(KRS 383.670) (1984 Code, § 153.33) (Ord. O-29-85, passed 5-29-1985)
§ 153.47 WAIVER OF LANDLORD’S RIGHT TO TERMINATE.
   Acceptance of rent with knowledge of a default by the tenant or acceptance
of performance by him or her that varies from the terms of the rental agreement
constitutes a waiver of the landlord’s right to terminate the rental agreement
for that breach, unless otherwise agreed after the breach has occurred.
(KRS 383.675) (1984 Code, § 153.34) (Ord. O-29-85, passed 5-29-1985)

   If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord may have a claim for
possession and for rent and a separate claim for actual damages for breach of
the rental agreement and reasonable attorney’s fees as provided in §
153.44(C) of this chapter.
(KRS 383.685) (1984 Code, § 153.36) (Ord. O-29-85, passed 5-29-1985)
§ 153.50 RECOVERY OF POSSESSION LIMITED.
   A landlord may not recover or take possession of the dwelling unit by action
or otherwise, including willful diminution of services to the tenant by
interrupting or causing the interruption of heat, electric, running water, hot
water, gas or other essential service to the tenant, except in case of
abandonment, surrender or as permitted in this chapter.
(KRS 383.690) (1984 Code, § 153.37) (Ord. O-29-85, passed 5-29-1985)
§ 153.51 PERIODIC TENANCY; HOLDOVER REMEDIES.
   (A)   The landlord or the tenant may terminate a week-to-week tenancy by a
written notice given to the other at least seven days before the termination
date specified in the notice.
   (B)   The landlord or the tenant may terminate a month-to-month tenancy by a
written notice given to the other at least 30 days before the periodic rental
date specified in the notice.
   (C)   The landlord or the tenant may terminate a tenancy begun upon the
termination of a written lease by written notice given to the other at least
ten days before the termination date specified in the notice; except that, if
the tenant fails to pay rent within ten days after the day it becomes due, the
landlord may terminate the tenancy at any time without notice.
   (D)   If the tenant remains in possession without the landlord’s consent
after expiration of the term of the rental agreement or its termination, the
landlord may bring an action for possession and if the tenant’s holdover is
willful and not in good faith the landlord may also recover an amount not more
than three months’ periodic rent or threefold the actual damages sustained by
him or her, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney’s fees. If the
landlord consents to the tenant’s continued occupancy, §
153.25(C) of this chapter applies.
(KRS 383.695) (1984 Code, § 153.38) (Ord. O-29-85, passed 5-29-1985)
§ 153.52 REMEDIES FOR ABUSE OF ACCESS.
   (A)   If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain
injunctive relief to compel access, or terminate the rental agreement. In
either case the landlord may recover actual damages and reasonable attorney’s
fees.
   (B)   If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an
unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but
which have the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may
obtain injunctive relief to prevent the reoccurrence of the conduct or
terminate the rental agreement. In either case, the tenant may recover actual
damages and reasonable attorney’s fees.
(KRS 383.700) (1984 Code, § 153.39) (Ord. O-29-85, passed 5-29-1985)
§ 153.53 RETALIATORY CONDUCT.
   (A)   Except as provided in this section, a landlord may not retaliate by
increasing rent or decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring
an action for possession after:
      (1)   The tenant has complained to a governmental agency charged with
responsibility for enforcement of a building or housing code of a violation
applicable to the premises materially affecting health and safety;
      (2)   The tenant has complained to the landlord of a violation under §
153.31 of this chapter; or
      (3)   The tenant has organized or become a member of a tenant’s union or
similar organization.
   (B)   If the landlord acts in violation of division (A) above, the tenant is
entitled to the remedies provided in §
153.43 of this chapter and has a defense in any retaliatory action against him
or her for possession. In an action by or against the tenant, evidence of a
complaint within one year before the alleged act of retaliation creates a
presumption that the landlord’s conduct was in retaliation. The presumption
does not arise if the tenant made the complaint after notice of a proposed rent
increase or diminution of services. PRESUMPTION means that the trier of fact
must find the existence of the fact presumed unless and until evidence is
introduced which would support a finding of its non-existence.
   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) above, a landlord may bring an
action for possession if:
      (1)   The violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused
primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant or other person in his or
her household or upon the premises with his or her consent;
      (2)   The tenant is in default in rent; or
      (3)   Compliance with the applicable building or housing code requires
alteration, remodeling or demolition which would effectively deprive the tenant
of use of the dwelling unit.
   (D)   The maintenance of an action under division (C) above does not release
the landlord from liability under §
153.39 of this chapter.

land existing prior to 1966;
      (3)   Lot lines that are to be adjusted in already recorded subdivisions
shall not involve more than three contiguous lots. If more than three lots are
involved, then the lots shall be handled as a resubdivision and processed
according to the applicable requirements of the preliminary and final plats;
and
      (4)   Except as noted in division (A)(3) above, the identification plat
process shall not be permitted in areas already approved or conditionally
approved as a preliminary plat.

applicable requirements of §
157.065 of this chapter and other pertinent sections of these regulations. In
addition, the identification plat shall also contain the following information:
         (a)   A statement by a registered land surveyor preparing the plat
that the parcel represents the first or second parcel subdivided from the
original tract existing prior to 1966;
         (b)   In the case of the second lot to be subdivided, sufficient
information shall be included to locate the parcel being subdivided in relation
to the previous subdivided parcel, as well as its location within the original
tract existing prior to 1966; and
         (c)   A vicinity map drawn at a scale of one inch to 2,000 feet or
greater (for example, one inch to 1,000 feet) on the plat showing, within one-
half mile of the proposed subdivision, existing roads and other significant
features (such as streams and lakes).
      (2)   At this time, the following information shall also be filed with
the Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative:
         (a)   Application for identification plat approval. An application
provided by the Commission shall be submitted. At the time of submission, the
Commission’s duly authorized representative shall indicate on the application
the date of submission and signature of the Commission’s duly authorized
representative;

minimum traverse calculations required shall include a closed traverse of the
subdivision boundaries as per §
157.065(B)(2) of this chapter; and
         (c)   Identification plat fees. Plat fees shall be submitted in
accordance with §
157.131(A) of this chapter.
   (C)   Processing of identification plat. The Planning Commission’s duly
authorized representative shall review the identification plat as per the
applicable requirements of §
157.065 of this chapter, the requirements of this section and other pertinent
sections of these regulations. Following the review, the Planning Commission’s
duly authorized representative shall take one of the following actions: approve
the identification plat; or disapprove the identification plat. Should the
Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative disapprove the
identification plat, written notice of such action, including the reasons for
disapproval, shall be mailed to the subdivider by the Planning Commission’s
duly authorized representative. The action shall be entered in the official
records of the Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative. If
approved and signed by the Chairperson of the Planning Commission, the original
identification plat shall be recorded in the County Clerk’s office per the
county’s requirements.

(1984 Code, § 157.45) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
DESIGN STANDARDS FOR LAYOUT OF
SUBDIVISIONS
§ 157.080 STREETS.
   (A)   Conformity to comprehensive plan or official map. Whenever a tract of
land to be subdivided or resubdivided includes any part of, or is adjacent to,
a proposed arterial or collector street as designated on the comprehensive plan
or the official map, the subdivider shall meet with the Planning Commission’s
duly authorized representative to determine its compliance (such as, right-of-
way width for future widening and pavement widths) and resulting design
requirements of such locations, otherwise such street right-of-way shall be
platted by the subdivider in the exact location so designated and at the width
indicated in these regulations.
   (B)   Street extension.
      (1)   Existing streets. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions
shall make provision for the proper continuation of existing streets in
adjoining areas, unless determined otherwise by the Planning Commission, or its
duly authorized representative.
      (2)   Adjacent property. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided and are
appropriate for future subdivision, arrangement of streets in new subdivisions
shall make provision for the proper projection of streets to those adjoining
areas in a manner which shall provide for the practical development of the
adjacent property.
      (3)   Half streets. Dedication of one-half of the rights-of-way (half
streets) for streets proposed along the boundaries of land to be subdivided
shall be prohibited.
   (C)   Street classification and function.
      (1)   Arterial streets.
         (a)   Arterial streets should be planned so as to provide for the
smooth flow of traffic between points of heavy traffic generation and from one
section of the community or communities to another. Such arterial streets
should traverse the entire community or communities.
         (b)   Arterial streets should not bisect neighborhoods, but should act
as boundaries between such neighborhoods.
         (c)   Direct access onto the roadway from abutting properties shall be
discouraged.
      (2)   Collector streets. Collector streets should be designed to provide
a traffic route from subcollector streets to arterial streets. These streets
should be designed to carry traffic which has an origin or destination within
the neighborhood and between arterial streets. Streets shall be designed in
such a manner to discourage short cuts through the neighborhood. Direct access
to abutting property should be discouraged whenever possible.
      (3)   Subcollector streets. Subcollector streets shall be designed to
provide a traffic route from local streets to collector streets. The streets
will serve equally both traffic movement and abutting properties.
      (4)   Local streets, including cul-de-sacs and courts. Local streets
shall provide direct and full access to each lot and direct traffic movement to
another local street or to a subcollector street. The street shall be laid out
so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Local street
intersections with arterial streets shall be discouraged, wherever practical.
      (5)   Frontage roads. Frontage roads may be required along an existing or
proposed arterial street to provide access to lots along such streets.
      (6)   Alleys. Where alleys are to be provided (such as in the case of
certain commercial development), they shall be designed to provide only
secondary access.
   (D)   Street rights-of-way.
      (1)   Widths and grades of new streets. Street right-of-way widths and
grades shall conform to the following minimum requirements:
TABLE 1

Subcollector                    50                         12      0.8
NOTES TO TABLE:
* Arterial streets shall be based on current design standards and other
pertinent requirements of the state’s Department of Transportation and the
official area-wide comprehensive plan.
** Requirements will vary for a frontage road depending on whether the
street would serve as a local subcollector or collector type street and as
such would be designed in accordance with the respective requirements of the
streets.
*** Except as may be permitted in §
157.104,Table 2, of these regulations.
 
      (2)   Exiting streets. Subdivisions platted along existing streets shall
dedicate additional right-of-way, if necessary, to meet the minimum street
width requirements set forth in division (D)(1) above. Such dedication shall be
in accordance with the following.
         (a)   At least the minimum right-of-way width shall be dedicated where
the subdivision is on both sides of an existing street.
         (b)   When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing
street, one-half of the required right-of-way width, measured from the
centerline of the right-of-way, shall be dedicated. However, the owner or
owners of such property shall not be required to dedicate more than one-half of
the required rights-of-way width.
   (E)   Curves and sight distance criteria.
      (1)   Horizontal curve. Where there is a change in the alignment of a
street along the centerline, a curve with a radius adequate to ensure safe
sight distance shall be constructed. The minimum radii of curves shall be:
 
Street Type           Minimum Curve Radius
Arterial              *
Collector             400 feet
Local or subcollector 100 feet
 
      (2)   Sight distance. Minimum sight distance shall be as required in App.
E, Tables 7a and 7b.
      (3)   Reverse curves. A tangent of at least 200 feet for collector
streets shall be provided between reverse curves. No tangent shall be required
for local and subcollector streets.
      (4)   Vertical curves. The minimum vertical curve length required shall
be calculated by multiplying the algebraic difference in grades times a “K”
factor. Rounded “K” factors for local and subcollector and collector streets
are as follows:*
 
Type of Street         “K” Factors
Collector              K equals 30 for crest curves
                       K equals 35 for sag curves
Local and subcollector K equals 15 for crest curves
                       K equals 15 for sag curves
NOTES TO TABLE:
* Design of arterial streets shall be based on current standards of the
state’s Department of Transportation.
 
   (F)   Cul-de-sac and dead-end streets. Cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets
designed to be dead-end permanently shall not be longer than 1,200 feet, unless
local topographic or other physical conditions are such as to render these
provisions impracticable.
   (G)   Street names and house numbers.
      (1)   Duplication. The name of a new street shall not duplicate existing
or platted street names in the county, or approximate such names in spelling,
or sound or pronunciation, or by the use of alternate prefixes such as “North”,
“South” or such suffixes as “Lane”, “Way”, “Drive”, “Court”, “Avenue” and
“Street”.
      (2)   Continuation of streets. New street names shall bear the same name
of any continuation of, or when in alignment with, an existing or platted
street.
      (3)   Approval of street names. All street names shall be approved by the
Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative before approval of the
final plat.
      (4)   House numbers. House numbers shall be assigned by the Planning
Commission’s duly authorized representative before approval of the final plat.
   (H)   Alleys.
      (1)    Alleys shall be prohibited in residential zoning districts, unless
otherwise approved by the Planning Commission or its duly authorized
representative.
      (2)   In commercial and industrial areas, adequate alleys shall be
provided where the design requires. Alleys shall not serve as part of the
required off-street parking, loading or unloading space required by the
applicable zoning ordinance.
   (I)   Private streets. New private streets or alleys shall not be created or
extended, except as approved by the Planning Commission, and existing ones
shall, whenever practicable, be dedicated to the public.
(1984 Code, § 157.55) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978; Ord. O-28-79, passed 3-
22-1979) Penalty, see §
157.999
§ 157.081 INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   Angle of intersection. The centerline of all streets shall intersect
as nearly at a 90-degree angle as possible, but in no case shall the angle of
intersection be less than 75 degrees or greater than 105 degrees, unless a
special modification is granted by the Planning Commission due to certain
exceptional conditions.
   (B)   Centerline offset of adjacent intersections. Where T-intersections are
used, the following minimum centerline offsets of adjacent intersections shall
be as follows:
 
Type of Street           Minimum Centerline Offset of Adjacent Intersections in
                         Feet
Collector - collector    200
Local - local            150
Local - subcollector     150
Subcollector - collector 150
 
   (C)   Corner radii. Property lines at street intersections shall be provided
from the same radius point necessary to establish the pavement radius. If
because of certain exceptional conditions a modification is granted permitting
an angle of intersection less than 75 degrees, or greater than 105 degrees,
then the minimum radii shall be increased or decreased, respectively.
   (D)   Centerline grades within intersections. Maximum centerline grades
within street intersections shall not exceed the grade for through streets, as
identified in §
157.080, Table 1, of these regulations, depending on the type of street. The
maximum grade of the centerline of the side streets intersecting with the
gutter line of the through street shall not exceed 4% for a distance of not
less than 75 feet from the centerline for local and subcollector streets and
150 feet for collector streets.
   (E)   Design adjacent to freeways, expressways, arterials or collectors. The
following principles shall be used in the design of subdivisions adjacent to
freeways, expressways or arterials.
      (1)   Street design shall have the purpose of making adjacent lots
desirable by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic and of minimizing the
interference with traffic on such thoroughfares.
      (2)   Collector, subcollector and local streets shall not be permitted to
intersect with freeways or expressways. The number of intersections with
arterial streets shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, such
intersections shall be spaced not less than 600 feet apart. In the case of
collector streets, intersections with those streets shall be spaced not less
than 400 feet apart and access to driveways shall be spaced at intervals of not
less than 200 feet. At those access points where turning vehicles to and from
the arterial and collector streets will affect the roadway capacity or safety,
reserved turn lanes shall be required, wherever practical. Frontage or service
roads shall be used when these spacing requirements cannot be met.
      (3)   Where frontage roads are not required, lots adjacent to such
thoroughfares shall, when practical, be served and be accessible only by a
street generally paralleling the thoroughfare or by a series of cul-de-sacs or
loop streets extending towards the thoroughfare from an internal street system.
(1984 Code, § 157.56) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 157.082 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Utility easements. Public utility easements at least ten feet in total
width may be required along the front, rear and sides of lots where needed for
the accommodation of a public utility, drainage or sanitary structures, or any
combination of the foregoing. Where deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission’s duly authorized representative, an additional easement width shall
be provided.
   (B)   Watercourses. The subdivider shall dedicate rights-of-way or provide
easements for storm drainage purposes which conform substantially with the
lines of any natural watercourses, channels, streams or creeks which traverse
the subdivision or for any new channel which is established to substitute for a
natural watercourse, channel, stream or creek. Such rights-of-way or easements
shall be of a width which will provide for the maintenance needs of the channel
as determined by the Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative.
(1984 Code, § 157.57) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 157.083 PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   Wherever practicable, subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the
natural topography of the land, to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of danger, to minimize destruction of trees
and topsoil, and to preserve such natural features as watercourses, unusual
rock formations, large trees, sites for historical significance and other
assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the
subdivision and the community.
(1984 Code, § 157.58) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 157.084 FLOOD HAZARDS.
   (A)   Prohibition of development in areas susceptible to flooding. Land
subject to flooding or otherwise uninhabitable shall not be platted for
residential, commercial or industrial uses or for any other use which may
increase the danger of health, life, property or aggravate erosion or flood
hazards. Such land within the subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for
such uses as will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or
will not result in conditions contrary to the public welfare (such as use as
open space, extensive recreation use and conservation purposes).
   (B)   Limited development. Areas of land adjacent to streams, rivers or
bodies of water which have a high degree of susceptibility to flooding shall be
limited to development according to either the flood protection control
regulations, if adopted as part of the applicable zoning ordinance, or
according to the following regulations.
      (1)   The limits of the floodplain (areas subject to flooding during the
occurrence of a 100-year flood), including elevations of the 100-year flood
level along the Ohio and Licking Rivers and certain tributaries thereof, are
designated on maps and charts on file in the office of the NKAPC. The limits of
the floodway are contained within the floodplain area.
      (2)   In the case of any subdivision to be developed along the
tributaries of the Ohio and Licking Rivers, and located in those areas which
are identified as being susceptible to flooding according to the report
prepared by the United States Department of the Agriculture, Soil Conservation
Service Soil Survey of Boone, Campbell and Kenton Counties, Kentucky, August,
1973, a survey shall be made by a qualified registered civil engineer
establishing the elevation of the 100-year flood and floodway for a tributary.
      (3)   No subdivider in development of a subdivision shall fill any area
with earth, debris or any other material or raise the level of any area in any
manner, or place a building, barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area
located within the floodway which would result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of a 100-year flood discharge. Plans and specifications
for any work which the subdivider believes will not increase the flood levels
shall be submitted to the Northern Kentucky Area Planning Commission and to the
Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative (if different) for review
and approval to determine if the encroachment will meet the requirements of
these regulations. Mobile homes shall be prohibited from being placed within
the floodway.
      (4)   All land in the subdivision which is outside the floodway of the
Ohio and Licking Rivers and their tributaries, but located within the
floodplain, may be used for any purpose for which it is zoned; provided that,
the land is graded in such a manner that any residential construction within
the floodplain shall have the lowest floor, which is used for living quarters,
elevated to or be above the level of the 100-year flood; and the land is graded
in such a manner that any new non-residential structures within the floodplain
area shall have the lowest floor elevated to or be above the level of the 100-
year flood or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities shall be
designed and flood-proofed so that, below the 100-year flood level, any
structures that are anticipated to be constructed are water-tight with walls
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
frequency.
      (5)   All streets and utilities constructed to serve the subdivision to
be located within the floodplain, but which are outside the floodway, shall be:
flood protected; the land filled; or any combination thereof, to a level of not
less than the elevation of the 100-year flood level. Where the fill is
partially within the floodplain, roadway access and utilities shall be provided
from the dry side (areas located above the 100-year floodplain).
   (C)   Stream easement. If a stream flows through or is adjacent to the
proposed subdivision, the plat shall provide for a storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way along the stream for a floodway of at least ten feet. For
the smaller streams, the plat shall provide for channel improvement to enable
them to carry all reasonable floods within banks. The floodway easement shall
be wide enough to provide for future enlargement of the stream channels as
adjacent areas become more highly developed and run-off rates are increased.
   (D)   Streets. Approval shall not be given for streets within a subdivision
which would be subject to flooding. All streets must be located at elevations
above a flood of a 100-year frequency in order that no portion of the
subdivision would become isolated by floods; except that, where a secondary
access is provided which would be above a 100-year flood frequency. However,
streets may be permitted in areas subject to flooding of a 100-year frequency
provided the streets provide access to activities relating to rivers, streams
and recreational activities located along the areas.
(1984 Code, § 157.59) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 157.085 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Arrangement. The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to provide for
convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. Blocks
intended to be used for commercial or industrial purposes shall be designed
specifically for such uses with space set aside for off-street parking and
loading or unloading facilities as required by the applicable zoning ordinance.
   (B)   Length. Blocks should not exceed 1,200 feet, except where
topographical or exceptional physical conditions exist.
   (C)   Width. The width of blocks should ordinarily be sufficient to allow
for two tiers of lots except for double frontage lots as permitted in §
157.086 of this chapter.
(1984 Code, § 157.60) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 157.086 LOTS.
   (A)   Conformance to zoning. All lots shall conform to or exceed the
requirements of the applicable zoning ordinance. Each lot shall front at least
20 feet onto a publicly dedicated street, other than an alley, or in the case
of two contiguous flag lots, 20-foot frontage may be reduced to ten feet of
frontage per parcel; provided, the contiguous lots share a common unobstructed
easement of access to the publicly dedicated street of at least 20 feet in
width; and, further provided, the common easement shall be located within 20-
foot strip. In no case shall more than two flag lots be contiguous to each
other at the publicly dedicated street. Flag lots shall only be used in those
locations where due to geometric, topographic and other physical features, it
would be impractical to extend a publicly dedicated street to serve lots
located in the areas, as determined by the Planning Commission’s duly
authorized repre- sentative.
   (B)   Lot frontage and width.
      (1)   Arterial street frontage. No access onto an arterial street shall
be permitted from abutting properties, except as provided for in these
regulations.
      (2)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall have extra width to permit
conformance to the minimum setback from the side street. In no case shall a
corner lot be so narrow that minimum zoning requirements cannot be met.
      (3)    Double frontage lots. Lots shall not be laid out so that they have
frontage onto more than one street, except:
         (a)   When the lots are adjacent to the intersection of two streets;
or
         (b)   When the rear of the lot faces an arterial, freeway, expressway,
collector street or railroad right-of-way, and the front of the lot faces onto
another street.
   (C)   Lot depth.
      (1)    Conformance to zoning. Each lot shall conform to all requirements
of the applicable zoning ordinance.
      (2)   Maximum depth. The maximum depth of a lot shall not be greater than
four times the width of the lot, except lots which contain over five acres of
area. Exceptional individual site conditions may require variation from these
requirements, as permitted by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative.
      (3)   Extra depth and width in certain cases. Additional side yard and
lot depth as per the applicable zoning ordinance may be required where a lot in
a subdivision abuts an industrial or commercially zoned area.
   (D)   Useable lots.
      (1)   Building lots. All subdivisions shall result in the creation of
lots which are developable and capable of being built on. No lots may be
developed which create building sites which are impracticable to improve due to
known problems related to soil conditions and geological formations and areas
subject to flood prone conditions based on information on file in the offices
of the NKAPC (soil survey studies prepared by the United States Soil
Conservation Service, Geological survey maps prepared by the United States
Geological Survey and flood prone information supplied by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Geological Survey).
      (2)   Strips of parcels. No remnants of property shall be left which do
not conform to minimum lot requirements for the zoning district in which the
property is located, or which are not required for a private or public utility
purpose, or which are not accepted by the legislative body or fiscal court or
any other appropriate public body for an appropriate use.
      (3)   Side lot lines. The side lot lines of all lots, whenever
practicable, shall be at right angles to the street which the lot faces or
radial to the center of curvature, if such street is curved. In the case of a
cul-de-sac on which the lot faces, side lot lines shall be as nearly radial to
the center of curvature of the cul-de-sac as practicable.
(1984 Code, § 157.61) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 157.087 PEDESTRIAN WAYS.
   Where deemed necessary by the Planning Commission’s duly authorized
representative, pedestrian ways may be required, and if provided, they should
not exceed a 15% grade, unless steps of an acceptable design, as determined by
the Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative, are to be
constructed.
(1984 Code, § 157.62) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 157.088 PUBLIC SITES.
   Where a proposed park or other recreational area, school site or other
public ground identified in the adopted County Comprehensive Plan is located in
whole or in part within the proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission’s
duly authorized representative may require a reservation, as a condition
precedent to preliminary plat approval, not to exceed one year, for the
purchase of such public ground by the applicable public body.

§ 157.100 IMPROVEMENTS; PRECONSTRUCTION MEETING.
   The improvements which are required shall be designed by a registered
professional engineer and installed in accordance with the provisions of these
and other applicable regulations. Prior to the commencement of any project, a
preconstruction meeting will be held with the applicable legislative body’s
engineer, or its duly authorized representative, to discuss the project in
regard to procedure, materials and inspections.
(1984 Code, § 157.70) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 157.101 DRAINAGE.
   (A)   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider
to provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and
the drainage area of which it is a part.
   (B)   The following requirements and methods shall be followed.
      (1)   Storm drainage; report required. The subdivider shall submit to the
Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative, a report by a registered
professional engineer, as to the ability of existing watercourse channels,
storm sewers, culverts and other improvements pertaining to drainage or flood
control within the subdivision, to handle the runoff which would be generated
by the development of the land within the subdivision, and the additional
runoff to be anticipated from the upstream drainage area, according to the land
use identified in the adopted comprehensive plan for the county. Additional
information shall be submitted to adequately indicate that provision has been
made for disposal of surface water without any damage to the developed or
undeveloped land downstream or below the proposed subdivision. This report
shall also include:
         (a)   Estimate of the quantity of storm water entering the subdivision
naturally from areas outside the subdivision;
         (b)   Quantities of flow at each pickup point (inlet); and
         (c)   Location, sizes and grades of required culverts, storm drainage
sewers and other required appurtenances.
      (2)   Drainage requirements (final grading).
         (a)   No final grading or sidewalk or pavement construction or
installation of utilities shall be permitted in any proposed street until the
improvement drawing and specifications have been submitted and approved by the
Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative.
         (b)   The subdivider shall grade each subdivision in order to
establish street, block and lot grades in proper relation to each other and to
topography, as follows.
            1.   Street grading plan. A grading plan shall be prepared for the
streets along with street improvement details, as per §
157.104 of this chapter.
            2.   Block grading. Block grading shall be accomplished in one or
more of the following methods:
               a.   A ridge constructed along the rear lot lines providing for
drainage into the streets;
               b.   Parts of all lots draining to a sidewalk or ditch along the
rear lot lines; or
               c.   Draining across rear or side lot lines; provided that,
drainage onto adjoining properties shall be controlled.
            3.   Lot grading. Lot grading shall be accomplished as follows:
lots shall be graded so that water drains away from each building at a minimum
grade of 2%. Surface drainage swales shall have a minimum grade of 2% and shall
be designed so that the surface water will drain into a driveway, street
gutter, storm sewer, drain inlet or natural drainage way. The minimum grades of
driveways shall be 0.4% and the maximum grade shall be as specified in §
157.105 of this chapter.
            4.   Top soil. If grading results in the stripping of top soil, top
soil shall be uniformly spread over the lots as grading is finished.
            5.   Trees. As many trees as can be reasonably utilized in the
final development plan shall be retained and the grading adjusted to the
existing grade of the trees where practicable.
      (3)   Drainage system requirements. The design criteria for storm
drainage systems shall be based on information from the Manual of Instructions
for Drainage Design prepared by the state’s Department of Transportation or any
other acceptable drainage manual.
         (a)   Culverts and storm sewers in all streets shall be designed for
at least a ten-year storm frequency and in no case shall a storm sewer be less
than 12 inches in size. In no case shall the time of concentration be less than
eight minutes.
         (b)   For open channels, roadway ditches, curb and gutters, and all
inlets, a storm frequency of ten years and a time of concentration of 20
minutes which yields an average intensity of four inches per hour shall be used
in all computations.
      (4)   Road drainage system. All roadways shall be provided with an
adequate storm drainage system.
         (a)   The road storm sewer system shall serve as the primary drainage
system and shall be designed to carry roadway, adjacent land and building storm
water drainage. No storm sewer shall be permitted to be run into the sanitary
sewer system within the proposed subdivision.
         (b)   Curb drainage inlets and catch basins shall be provided at
intervals along roadways. Inlet spacing shall be adequate to ensure that the
flow of water should not encroach on the outside lane by more than six feet for
a storm of 20 minutes duration and ten-year storm frequency.
      (5)   Off-road drainage systems. The design of any off-road drainage
shall include the watershed affecting the subdivision and shall be extended to
a watercourse or drainage way adequate to receive the storm drainage.
         (a)   When the drainage system is outside of the road right-of-way,
the subdivider shall make provisions for dedicating of an easement to the
applicable legislative body or fiscal court to provide for the future
maintenance of the system.
         (b)   The size and location of all off- street watercourses or ditches
running through the subdivision shall be enclosed or left open, subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission’s duly authorized representative.
         (c)   Roof and area drain pipes shall not be connected into or through
the curb and gutter section of the public street, but rather directly connected
to a storm sewer system or discharged onto the same parcel of land from which
the water is generated.
      (6)   Drainage easement. Easements for drainage purposes shall be a
minimum of ten feet in width. Where the watercourse is large, easement widths
shall be increased as determined by the Planning Commission’s duly authorized
representative. Where watercourses cross platted lots diagonally, the
subdivider should straighten such courses where practicable and should
substantially follow sublot lines. Easements shall be shown on the record plat
and shall cover all existing or reconstructed watercourses.
      (7)   Protection of drainage systems. The banks of newly created ditches
and channels shall be stabilized with adequate material to prevent erosion.
Newly created ditches and open channels shall be seeded, sodded, rip-rapped,
paved or other acceptable erosion control methods used depending on grades,
slopes and type of soils. Wherever practical, existing ditches and channels
shall be retained in their natural state.
      (8)   Material specifications. Material and construction specifications
for all drainage projects shall be designed in accordance with the requirements
of App. C of these regulations.

the minimum right-of-way is increased by 10 feet, except for collector streets.
(D) Driveway access points along collector streets shall be discouraged, however, if permitted,
shall be spaced not less than 200 feet apart.
(E) Individual off-street parking spaces shall be laid out in such a manner to insure that each
space has unrestricted ingress and egress to a public street (for example, not blocked from
gaining access to the street via another parked vehicle).
(F) Arterial streets shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of the Kentucky
Department of Transportation.
(G) Minimum pavement thickness for portland cement concrete and asphalt concrete shall be
designed in accordance with
App. A, § 16, Table 3, and
App. B, § 6, Table 6, respectively.
(H) In the case where local streets serving less than 25 lots, the minimum lot width shall be as
per the applicable zoning ordinance requirements.
 
   (G)   Parking. Parking on any street where pavement width is less than 36
feet shall be limited to one side of the street. Parking lanes shall not be

is located.
   (H)   Cul-de-sac and dead-end streets. Cul-de-sac courts and dead-end
streets shall be designed in accordance with the typical design details as per
App. C of this chapter. However, if conditions warrant, other turn-around
designs may be permitted by the Planning Commission or its duly authorized
representative. If such street is of a temporary nature and a further extension
into adjacent land is anticipated, then the turn around, beyond normal street
width, shall be in the nature of an easement of the premises included in the
turn around, as per the typical design in App. C of this chapter. Such easement
may be vacated to abutting property owners when the dead-end street is legally
extended into adjacent land. If such dead-end street serves four lots or less,
no temporary turn around will be required.

§ 1. CEMENT FOR STREET, CURB AND GUTTER, SIDEWALK AND DRIVEWAY CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Labor. The work covered by these specifications consists of furnishing
all labor, equipment and materials and in performing all operations in
connection with the construction of air-entrained portland cement concrete
pavement for streets and alleys in accordance with these specifications and the
applicable drawings.
   (B)   Work. The cement concrete pavement work shall consist of a single
course of cement concrete, including reinforcement and longitudinal and
transverse joints, when required, constructed on a prepared subgrade or
insulation course in conformity with the lines, grades and cross-sections shown
on the plans.
   (C)   Grading. This term shall consist of all grading above or below
subgrade elevations, of whatever nature, required to bring the street to the
proper subgrade elevation, including necessary excavation for curb, gutter,
sidewalk, construction of embankments, excavation and proper sloping of all
cuts, and other work incidental thereto.
      (1)   Excavations. All excavations shall be made to approximate subgrade
elevations and shall be true to grade. No excavation shall be made below
subgrade elevation except to remove a spongy material, vegetable matter or
other material as ordered or approved by the inspector, or his or her duly
authorized representative. In the event the contractor does excavate any other
area below subgrade elevation, he or she shall replace the excavated material
with satisfactory material and shall thoroughly compact same.
      (2)   Excavation below subgrade. Whenever excavation below subgrade
elevation to remove spongy material, vegetable matter or other material is
required, the contractor shall remove same in a satisfactory manner, and shall
replace it with satisfactory material in layers not to exceed 12 inches in
thickness and shall thoroughly compact each layer before the next layer is
placed.
      (3)   Construction of embankments.
         (a)   All top soil shall be removed to eliminate all vegetation from
the area upon which embankment is to be constructed. Soil so removed may not be
used in construction of embankment.
         (b)   Embankment shall be constructed of approved materials to
approximate subgrade elevation in layers to not exceed 12 inches in thickness
and extending the full width of the embankment. Each layer shall be compacted
to not less than 92% of the density determined from the Standard Test for
Moisture-Density Relationship (AASHO Designation T-99) in areas involving
structures and public improvements including slopes greater than 3:1.
      (4)   Subgrade preparation.
         (a)   The subgrade shall be in a moist condition at the time the
concrete is placed. It shall be thoroughly wetted a sufficient time in advance
of the placing of the concrete to insure that there will be no puddles or
pockets of mud when the concrete is placed. The subgrade, however, shall not be
allowed to dry out before the concrete is placed.
         (b)   The subgrade soils shall be of uniform material and density to
provide for satisfactory pavement performance. Soft spots that show up during
construction should be excavated and recompacted with the same type of material
as found in the adjacent subgrade. Uniform support cannot be obtained merely by
dumping extra granular material on the soft spot. With a uniform subgrade,
excessive shrink and swell of expansion soils shall be prevented by adequate
moisture and density controls during compactions. The compaction percent of the
density determined from the Standard Test for Moisture-Density Relationship
(AASHO Designation T-99) will effectively control shrinking and swelling during
periods of dry weather; providing, the subgrade is not allowed to dry before
the pavement is constructed. Concurrent with compaction, the subgrade shall be
shaped to plan elevation, grade and cross-section. Special care shall be taken
in compacting the backfill of sewers, drainage facilities and other permanent
structures that may be in the paved area.
         (c)   Immediately prior to placing the concrete, the subgrade shall be
tested for conformity with the cross-section shown on the plans by means of an
approved template riding on the side forms. If necessary, material shall be
removed or added, as required, to bring all portions of the subgrade to the
correct elevation. It shall then be thoroughly compacted and again tested with
the template. Concrete shall not be placed on any portion of the subgrade which
has not been tested for correct elevation. The subgrade should also be cleared
of any loose material which may have fallen upon it.
      (5)   Equipment for compaction of embankment and subgrade. Any compaction
equipment capable of uniformly producing the required embankment and subgrade
densities, without lamination of, or within, successive layers, will be
permitted. All compaction equipment shall be in good condition and shall be
operated efficiently to assure uniform compaction.
      (6)   Subgrade for curbs, gutters, sidewalks and driveways. Subgrade
areas to be occupied by curbs, gutters, sidewalks and driveways shall be
excavated, backfilled as required, and compacted to establish grade. This work
shall be done with particular care in accordance with all requirements herein.
      (7)   Equipment operated on the streets. The contractor shall be
permitted to operate only pneumatic- tired equipment over any paved street

§ 7. CONSOLIDATING AND FINISHING.
   (A)   The pavement shall be struck off and consolidated with a mechanical
finishing machine or by hand- finishing methods. When a mechanical finishing
machine is used, the concrete shall be struck off at such a height that after
consolidation and final finishing, it shall be at the elevation as shown on the
plans.
   (B)   The finishing machine shall be provided with a screed which will
consolidate the concrete by pressure, vibration or both. The concrete shall be
brought to a true and even surface, free from rock pockets. The edge of the
screeds along the curb line may be notched out to allow for sufficient concrete
to form the integral curb. Hand-finishing tools shall be kept available for use
in case the finishing machine breaks down.
   (C)   When hand-finishing is used, the pavement shall be struck off and
consolidated by a vibrating screed to the elevation as shown on the plans. When
the forward motion of the vibrating screed is stopped, the vibrator shall be
shut off; it shall not be allowed to idle on the concrete.
      (1)   Scraping and straight-edging.
         (a)   The pavement may be required, by the inspector, where
applicable, to be scraped with a straight-edge equipped with handles long
enough to permit it to be operated from the edge of the pavement.
         (b)   When irregularities are discovered, they shall be corrected by
adding or removing concrete. All disturbed places shall be floated with a
wooden or metal float not less than three feet long and not less than six
inches wide and again straight-edged.
      (2)   Edging. Before final finishing is completed and before the concrete
has taken its initial set, the edges of the slab and curb shall be carefully
finished with an edger, having a radius of one-eighth inch.
      (3)   Final surface finish. A burlap drag shall be used as the final
finishing method for concrete pavement. The drag shall be at least three feet
in width and long enough to cover the entire pavement width. It shall be laid
on the surface of the pavement and dragged forward in the direction in which
the pavement is being laid. The curb shall have the same final finish as the
pavement.
      (4)   Texture, grades. The final surface of the concrete pavement and
curb shall have a uniform gritty texture, free from excessive harshness and
true to the grades and cross-sections shown on the plans. The inspector may
require changes in the final finishing procedures as required to produce the
desired final surface texture.
(1984 Code, Ch. 157, App. A, § 7) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 8. INTEGRAL CURB.
   (A)   When integral vertical curbs are required along the edges of all
street pavement, depressed curbs shall be provided at all driveway entrances
and at such other locations as designated by the approved plans.
   (B)   The integral curb shall be constructed with or immediately following
the finished operation. Special care shall be taken so that the curb
construction does not lag the pavement construction and form a cold joint.
   (C)   In placing curb concrete, sufficient spading shall be done to secure
adequate bond with paving a slab and eliminate all voids in the curb.
   (D)   Curbs shall be formed to the cross-section in accordance with App. C
of this chapter.
(1984 Code, Ch. 157, App. A, § 8) (Ord. O-86-78, passed 8-17-1978)
§ 9. CURING.
   (A)   Concrete shall be cured by protecting it against loss of moisture,
rapid temperature change, from rain, flowing water and mechanical injury for a
period of not less than five days from the beginning of the curing operation.
Moist curing, water-proof paper, white pigmented liquid membrane compound, or a
combination thereof may be used for curing. Immediately after finishing
operations have been completed, the entire surface of the newly laid concrete
shall be covered by the curing medium which is applicable to local conditions
and approved by the inspector.
   (B)   The edge of concrete slabs exposed by the removal of forms shall be
protected immediately to provide these surfaces with continuous curing
treatment equal to the method selected for curing a slab surface and to prevent
injury to concrete edges.
   (C)   The covering material shall be kept free of any substances which may
be detrimental to the surface of the concrete. The initial curing medium shall
be effective and shall be applied so as to prevent checking, cracking and the
appearance of dry spots in the surface of the concrete. The contractor shall
have the equipment needed for adequate curing at hand and ready to install
before actual concrete placement begins. In all cases in which the curing
medium requires the use of water, the curing shall have prior right to all
water supply. Failure to provide sufficient cover material of the type
selected, failure to maintain saturation for the entire curing period in the
moist-curing methods, lack of water to adequately care for both curing and
other requirements or other failures to comply with curing requirements shall
be cause for immediate suspension of concreting operations.
      (1)   Moist curing.
         (a)   Moist curing shall be accomplished by covering of burlap, cotton
mats or other approved fabric mat used singly or in combination.
         (b)   Curing mats shall be thoroughly wet when applied and kept
continuously wet and in intimate contact with the pavement surface for the
duration of the moist curing period. Other fabric mats shall conform in design
and shall provide a curing medium at least equal to cotton mats. Cotton mats,
other fabric mats and burlap mats and burlap strips shall be furnished in the
widths or lengths, after shrinkage, required to cover the entire width and
edges of the pavement lane. Mats or burlap shall be lapped at joints between
adjacent sheets to prevent drying of this location. Moist curing, when used as
initial curing, shall be continued for not less than 24 hours. Type and weight
of cotton mats for curing concrete shall conform to ASTM C-440 or AASHO M-73.
Burlap strips shall conform to AASHO M-182.
      (2)   Water-proof paper and polythene setting curing. The surface of the
concrete shall be wetted with a fine spray of water and then covered with the
water-proof paper or sheeting. The paper or sheeting shall be in pieces large
enough to cover the entire width and edges of the slab and shall be lapped not
less than 12 inches. Paper or sheeting shall be adequately weighted to prevent
displacement or billowing due to wind. Paper or sheeting folded down over the
side of the pavement widths shall be secured by a continuous bank of earth.
Tears or holes appearing in the paper or sheeting during the curing period
shall be immediately repaired.
      (3)   Liquid membrane curing compound. Pigmented liquid membrane curing
compound shall meet the specifications under ASTM C-309. The curing compound
must be applied to cover the surface completely and uniformly at a rate which
will achieve the performance requirement specified in AASHO specifications M-
148 or ASTM Designation C-309. This method of curing shall be applied
immediately behind the final finishing operation or after the initial curing
when a combination of methods are used. Failure to provide complete and uniform
coverage at the required rate will be cause for discontinuance of this method
of curing and the substitution of one of the other approved methods. The
compound shall be kept agitated to prevent the pigment from settling. Special
care shall be taken to apply the curing compound to the pavement edges
immediately after the forms have been removed.

early enough to control cracking, but late enough to prevent any damage by
blade action in the slab surface and to the concrete immediately adjacent to
the joints.
      (3)   Construction joints. Transverse construction joints of the type
shown on the plans shall be placed wherever the placing of concrete is
suspended for more than 30 minutes. A transverse construction joint with smooth
bars shall be used if the joint occurs at the location of a contraction joint.
Deformed tie bars are used if the joint occurs at any other locations.
      (4)   Longitudinal joints. Longitudinal joints shall be placed as shown
on the plans. They shall be of the sawed, dummy groove, premolded strip of tied
construction type. All longitudinal sawed joints shall conform to
App. A, § 10(F)(2), of these regulations. Joints between construction lanes
shall be the tied construction type. The depth of longitudinal joints, except
for construction joints, shall be at least one-fourth of the pavement
thickness. They shall coincide with lane markings wherever possible and shall
be provided between each traffic lane.
      (5)   Integral curb joints. In the construction of transverse joints of

elevation to remove spongy material, vegetable matter or other material is
required, the contractor shall remove same in a satisfactory manner, and shall
replace it with satisfactory material in layers not to exceed 12 inches in
thickness and shall thoroughly compact each layer before the next layer is
placed.
   (C)   Construction of embankments.
      (1)   All top soil shall be removed to eliminate all vegetation from the
area upon which embankment is to be constructed. Soil so removed may not be
used in construction of embankment.
      (2)   Embankment shall be constructed, of approved materials, to
approximate subgrade elevation in layers to not exceed 12 inches in thickness
and extending the full width of the embankment. Each layer shall be compacted
to not less than 92% of the density determined from the Standard Test for
Moisture-Density Relationship (AASHO Designation T-99) in areas involving
structures and public improvements including slopes greater than 3:1.
   (D)   Subgrade preparation.
      (1)   The subgrade shall be in a moist condition at the time the paving
course is placed. It shall be thoroughly wetted a sufficient time in advance of
the placing of the concrete to ensure that there will be no puddles or pockets
of mud when the concrete is placed. The subgrade, however, shall not be allowed
to dry out before the paving course is placed.
      (2)   The subgrade soils shall be of uniform material and density to
provide for satisfactory pavement performance. Soft spots that show up during
construction should be excavated and recompacted with the same type of material
as found in the adjacent subgrade. Uniform support cannot be obtained merely by
dumping extra granular material on the soft spot. With a uniform subgrade,
excessive shrink and swell of expansive soils shall be prevented by adequate
moisture and density controls during compactions. The compaction percent of the
density determined from the Standard Test for Moisture-Density Relationship
(AASHO Designation T-99) will effectively control shrinking and swelling during
periods of dry weather, providing the subgrade is not allowed to dry before the
pavement is constructed. Concurrent with compaction, the subgrade shall be
shaped to plan elevation, grade and cross-section. Special care shall be taken
in compacting the backfill of sewers, drainage facilities and other permanent
structures that may be in the paved area.
      (3)   Immediately prior to placing the paving course, the subgrade shall
be tested for conformity with the cross-section shown on the plans by means of
an approved template riding on the side forms. If necessary, material shall be
removed or added, as required, to bring all portions of the subgrade to the
correct elevation. It shall then be thoroughly compacted and again tested with
the template. The paving course shall not be placed on any portion of the
subgrade which has not been tested for correct elevation. The subgrade should
also be cleared of any loose material which may have fallen on it.
   (E)   Equipment for compaction of embankment and subgrade. Any compaction
equipment capable of uniformly producing the required embankment and subgrade
densities, without lamination of, or within, successive layers, will be
permitted. All compaction equipment shall be in good condition and shall be
operated efficiently to assure uniform compaction.
   (F)   Subgrade for curbs, gutters, sidewalks and driveways. Subgrade areas
to be occupied by curbs, gutters, sidewalks and driveways shall be excavated,
backfilled as required, and compacted to establish grade. This work shall be
done with particular care in accordance with all requirements herein.
   (G)   Equipment operated on the streets. The contractor shall be permitted
to operate only pneumatic-tired equipment over any paved street surfaces and
shall be responsible for correction of any damage to street surfaces in any
manner resulting from the contractor’s operations.
   (H)   Protection of utility lines. The contractor shall at all times take
proper precautions for the protection of utility lines, the presence of which
are known, or can be determined by the examination of appropriate maps of
applicable agencies and legislative body or fiscal court.

§ 3. PREPARATION OF EXISTING GRANULAR BASE COURSES FOR SURFACING.
   (A)   Description and general requirements. In areas where granular base
course has been placed as a previous stage of street or road construction, the
contractor shall blade, shape and compact the base course in conformance with
the required dimensions, line, grade and cross-section to permit completion of
the paving work. When directed by the inspector, additional base course
aggregate shall be provided or excess aggregate removed and disposed of by the
contractor, as to provide conformance with the required roadway section.
   (B)   Thickness of surfacing required for existing granular base courses.
The existing thickness of granular base comprises a portion of the required
design thickness as specified in
App. B, § 5(B), of this chapter.
   (C)   Dividing existing thickness. The existing thickness of granular base
must be divided by the appropriate conversion factor, contained in
App. B, § 6, Table 4, of this chapter for the inplace base type to determine
the portion of the design thickness, the equivalent thickness, represented by
the existing granular base course. The difference between the design thickness
and the equivalent thickness is the thickness of surfacing that shall be
required to be constructed over the existing granular base course. Composition
and construction of the required surfacing shall meet all requirements herein
specified.

* Measured from a vehicle ten feet back of the pavement edge.
NOTE:
   (A)   Values are for urban conditions. On rural streets, distances are to be
increased by 10% to allow for longer drive reaction timing.
   (B)   The sight distances apply when street grades are zero to 3.0% (either
up or down). When an upgrade is steeper than 3.0%, adjustments are to be made
to compensate for the longer time required to reach the speed of highway
traffic. The time is less than shown when the highway is descending. Adjustment
factors below apply to grades only in that portion of the road between the
access points and the downstream point at which a vehicle is emerging from the
access points has been able to accelerate to within ten miles per hour of the
route speed.
   (C)   When the street in the section to be used for acceleration after
leaving the access point ascends at 3 to 4%, then sight distances in the
direction of approaching ascending traffic are to be increased by a factor of
1.4. When the access point ascends at 5 to 6%, sight distance should be
increased by a factor of 1.7.
   (D)   When the road in the section to be used for acceleration after leaving
the access point descends at 3 to 4%, then sight distance in the direction of
approaching descending highway traffic should be reduced by a factor of 0.6. If
the road descends at 5 to 6%, sight distance should be reduced by a factor of
0.5.
   (E)   When the criteria for sight distances to the right cannot be met, the
need can be eliminated by prohibiting left turns by existing vehicles.

EMERGENCY TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON ACCEPTANCE OF NEW APPLICATIONS FOR AND
ISSUANCE OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS FOR SHORT-TERM RENTAL DWELLINGS
§ 158.02 MORATORIUM.
   The recent increase in short-term rentals in the city has had detrimental
effects on the residential character of neighborhoods and the community's
affordable housing stock, thereby creating an emergency. The city hereby
temporarily prohibits the issuance of new conditional use permits for short-
term rental dwellings and prohibits the acceptance, review, and processing by
the city's authorized staff and Board of Architectural Review and Development
of any applications for conditional use permits for short- term rental
dwellings within the city limits pending further study, enactment, and effect
of new or amended short-term rental ordinances. This emergency ordinance shall
not prohibit the issuance of conditional use permits for short-term rental
dwellings to persons who submitted applications for such permits prior to the
effective date of this emergency ordinance. Furthermore, the City Manager, or
the designee of the City Manager, may issue licenses to those who have already
obtained a conditional use permit for short-term rental dwellings.
(Ord. O-30-22, passed 12-20-2022)
§ 158.03 TERM; RENEWAL.
   For the reasons set forth above, an emergency is hereby declared to exist
and the provisions of this emergency ordinance shall become effective
immediately upon its adoption by a vote of 2/3 or more of the legislative body.
This emergency ordinance shall terminate and be of no further effect six months
from the effective date of this emergency ordinance unless the City Board of
Commissioners extends the moratorium or terminates the moratorium. If an
extension or termination is approved, the city will publish notice of its
adoption.

reason, such holding shall not be construed as affecting the validity of the
remaining portions of this ordinance.
