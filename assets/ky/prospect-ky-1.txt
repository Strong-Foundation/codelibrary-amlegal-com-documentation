as the case may be.

meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 34.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION INSPECTION.
   (A)   Any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a request for inspection at the office of the City Clerk during
regular office hours, except during legal holidays. The official custodian or
the custodian acting under the authority of the official custodian, may require
a request to inspect public records to be in writing, signed by the applicant
and with the applicant's name printed legibly on the application. A written
request to inspect public records may be presented by hand delivery, mail or
via facsimile, if one is available.
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person's request is in compliance
with this chapter and the open records law, and the requested public records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the public records for
inspection. A person may inspect public records at the designated office of the
city during the regular office hours, or in appropriate cases, by receiving
copies of the records through the mail.
   (C)   If the public records are to be inspected at the offices of the city,
suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk or
in another office of the city as determined by the official custodian or
custodian for the inspection. No person shall remove original copies of public
records from the offices of the city without written permission of the official
custodian of the record. When public records are inspected at the city offices,
the person inspecting the records shall have the right to make abstracts and
memoranda of the public records and to obtain copies of all written public
records. When copies are requested, the custodian may require advance payment
of the prescribed fee.
   (D)   Upon proper request, the city shall mail copies of the public records
to a person whose residence or principal place of business is located outside
the county after the person precisely describes the public records which are
readily available and after the person pays in advance the prescribed fee.
§ 34.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk does not have custody or control of the public record or
records requested, the City Clerk shall notify the applicant and shall furnish
the name and location of the official custodian of the agency's public records.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 34.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection or mailing of the public
records, not to exceed five days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays) from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the
cause is given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on
which the public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies thereof. However, refusal under this section must be sustained by
clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and
legal holidays) after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under his authority and shall constitute final
agency action.
(KRS 61.880)
§ 34.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.
   No official of the city shall willfully conceal or destroy any record with
the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these rules and
regulations.
§ 34.11 ACCESS TO RECORDS RELATING TO PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.
   Any person shall have access to any public record relating to him or in
which he is mentioned by name, upon presentation of appropriate identification,
subject to the provisions of §
34.16 of these rules and regulations.
(KRS 61.884)
§ 34.12 FORMAT OF COPIES.
   (A)   Upon inspection, the applicant shall have the right to make abstracts
of the public records and memoranda thereof, and to obtain copies of all public
records not exempted by the terms of §
34.16. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee, including postage where appropriate.
If the applicant desires copies of public records other than written records,
the custodian of the records shall duplicate the records or permit the
applicant to duplicate the records; however, the custodian shall ensure that
such duplication will not damage or alter the original records.
   (B)   (1)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall
be available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
      (2)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not
less than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public record may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(1) - (3))
§ 34.13 FEES FOR COPIES.
   (A)   The public agency may prescribe a reasonable fee for making copies of
nonexempt public records requested for use for noncommercial purposes which
shall not exceed the actual cost of reproduction, including the costs of the
media and any mechanical processing cost incurred by the public agency, but not
including the cost of staff required. If a public agency is asked to produce a
record in a nonstandardized format, or to tailor the format to meet the request
of an individual or a group, the public agency may at its discretion provide
the requested format and recover staff costs as well as any actual costs
incurred.
   (B)   (1)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee.
      (2)   The public agency from which copies of nonexempt public records are
requested for a commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the
requestor stating the commercial purpose for which they shall be used, and may
require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract
shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a
specified fee.
      (3)   The fee provided for in division (B)(1) of this section may be
based on one or both of the following:
         (a)   Cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing, and
staff required to produce a copy of the public record or records;
         (b)   Cost to the public agency of the creation, purchase, or other

(KRS 61.874(3),(4))
Cross-reference:
   Fees for online access to public records, see §
34.15
§ 34.14 MISSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE PROHIBITED.
   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a public
record for a:
   (A)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to §
34.13;
   (B)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use of
the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
   (C)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical, radio
or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission
for that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874(5)) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 34.15 ONLINE ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS IN ELECTRONIC FORM.
   (A)   Online access to public records in electronic form may be provided and
made available at the discretion of the public agency. If a party wishes to
access public records by electronic means and the public agency agrees to
provide online access, a public agency may require that the party enter into a
contract, license, or other agreement with the agency, and may charge fees for
these agreements.
   (B)   Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges; and
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in §

records the disclosure or publication of which is directed by other statute.
      (3)   (a)   Records confidentially disclosed to the agency, or required
by an agency to be disclosed to it, generally recognized as confidential or

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under
this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a
decision is made to take no action. The exemptions provided by this subdivision
shall not be used by the custodian of the records to delay or impede the
exercise of rights granted by this chapter.

disclosure of statistical information not descriptive of any readily

include, but not be limited to work plans, job performance, demotions,

(A)(14) of this section, the public agency shall not be required to make a copy
of the recording except as provided in KRS 61.169, and the requesting parties

that a person has violated a city ordinance, the Code Enforcement Officer and
the Mayor or the Mayor’s designee may, in lieu of immediately issuing a
citation, give notice that a violation shall be remedied within a specified
period of time. If the person to whom the notice is given fails or refuses to
remedy the violation within the time specified, the Code Enforcement Officer is

issue the citation by:
      (1)   Personal service on the alleged violator;

the premised, if the alleged violator is not on the premises at the time the

last known recorded mailing address of the alleged violator; or
      (4)   If, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the issuance of the
citation using the methods above is not possible, then the citation is properly
served by posting a copy of the citation in a conspicuous place on the
premises.
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the city from taking immediate
action to remedy a violation of its ordinances when there is reason to believe
that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and
welfare, or if in the absence of immediate action, the effects of the violation
will be irreparable or irreversible.
   (D)   The citation issued by the Code Enforcement Officer shall contain the
following information:
      (1)   The date and time of issuance;
      (2)    The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued;
      (3)   The date and time the offense was committed, if known;

fine or to contest the citation; and

forth in the citation or contest the citation within the time allowed and fails
to appear at the hearing, the person shall be deemed to have waived their right
to a hearing before the Code Enforcement Board to contest the citation and a
determination by the Board that the violation was committed shall be final, and
the alleged violator shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the
final order to district court.
   (E)   After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall forward the original and one copy to the Mayor or his designee,
who will notify the Code Enforcement Board members of any scheduled hearings
and provide the public with appropriate “open meeting” notifications when an
offender does not pay the fine within seven days or requests, in writing, a
hearing to contest the citation.
   (F)   (1)   If the alleged violator does not pay the civil fine within seven
days of the citation, and does not contest the citation by appearing at the
hearing before the Code Enforcement Board, the Board shall, upon determining
that the violation was committed, enter a final order and impose a civil fine
within the range of the uncontested and maximum fine on the citation. More than
one fine may be assessed when:
         (a)   The ordinance provides that each day the violation continues may
be considered a separate offense; and

determining the violation was committed and shall impose the civil fine set
forth in the citation. A copy of the final order shall be served upon the

violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process
shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings.
   (D)   The Code Enforcement Board shall, based on the evidence, determine
whether a violation was committed. If it determines that no violation was
committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered. If it determines

and either imposing a fine up to the maximum authorized by this or other
ordinance or requiring the offender to remedy a continuing violation, or both.

TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES
§ 70.15 SIGNAL LEGENDS.
   Whenever traffic is regulated or controlled exclusively by a traffic-control
sign or signs exhibiting the words “Go,” “Caution,” or “stop,” or exhibiting
different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or “Go:” Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or “Caution” when shown following the green or
“Go” signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or “Stop:” Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or “Go” is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed
until it can do so without danger.
   (E)   Flashing amber alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall reduce
its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection controlled by such
signal.
   (F)   “Yield Right-of-Way:” Vehicular traffic facing the “Yield Right-of-
Way” sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a “Yield Right-of-Way”
sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a speed in excess
of 15 miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not apply to vehicles
entering an expressway.
   (G)   Lane lights: When lane lights are installed over any street for the
purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing amber lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from
that lane. Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles shall not move
against them. If flashing amber lights show above a lane, that lane shall be
used only for passing and for left turns unless a sign at such place prohibits
such turn.

control lights or signals or established regulations in order to facilitate the
movement of traffic.

public trees, stumps, plants, or shrubs within the lines of all streets,
alleys, lanes, and other public grounds as may be necessary to ensure public
safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public
grounds. The city, in consultation with the Forestation Board, and a
professional arborist or professional forester retained by the city if deemed
appropriate, may remove or cause or order to be removed or remediated any
public tree or any portion thereof which is in an unsafe condition or which by
reason of its nature is injurious due to fungus, insects, or other pests. All
contractual work or labor conducted on behalf of the city in planting, pruning,
maintaining or removing public trees or stumps shall be done in accordance with
current American National Standards for Arboricultural Operations Safety
Requirements (ANSI Z133) and current American National Standards for Tree Care

§ 97.13 REMEDIAL ACTION BY PROPERTY OWNER REGARDING DEAD, DISEASED OR INFECTED
TREES.
   The city in consultation with the Forestation Board may determine that a
tree or any portion of a tree located on private property within the city
presents an unsafe condition constituting an imminent danger to the general
public or presents a threat or potential threat of the spread of disease to
other trees within the city due to injurious fungi, insects, or other pests.
Should such a determination be made, the city shall notify the owner of the
tree’s condition. Thereafter, the city may notify the owner of required
remediation. Within 14 days of receipt of such notice, the owner may file a
written appeal of the proposed remediation. Any such appeal may be supported by
a written report or finding from a ISA certified (International Society of
Arboriculture), professional arborist or by other evidence. The Forestation
Board shall within 30 days issue a written ruling on the appeal. Absent an
appeal and within the 14-day period, the property owner shall provide written
confirmation of intent to remediate and a schedule for remediation. If
remediation is not completed within 45 calendar days, the city may provide
further written notice advising the owner of the city’s intent to remove or
otherwise remediate the tree or trees. Any entry by the city or contractor
selected by the city on to private property to evaluate, remediate, or remove a
tree shall be undertaken in compliance with state and federal law, and with
reasonable notice having been provided to the owner of the property. The notice
shall further advise the owner: 1) of the city’s intent to assess the owner the
costs incurred by the city and any related fine that may be imposed on the
owner; and 2) of the city’s intent to assert a lien on the property if payment
is not received by the city within 30 days.

larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree
so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely
damaged by storms or other causes or certain trees under utility wires and
other obstructions where alternative pruning practices are impractical may be
exempt from this chapter by written decision of the Forestation Board. No
person shall, with respect to any street tree, park tree or other tree on
public property, intentionally damage, cut, carve, attach any rope, wire,
nails, advertising posters, or other contrivance to said trees; allow any
gaseous, liquid, chemical, or solid substance which is harmful to trees to come
in contact with said trees or the base of said trees; or set fire or permit
fire to burn when such fire or heat from fire will injure any portion of said
trees.

§ 97.15 PRUNING, CORNER CLEARANCE, STREET LAMP AND TRAFFIC CONTROL OBSTRUCTION.
   The owner of any tree overhanging a street or right-of-way within the city
shall prune the branches so that such branches do not obstruct the light from
any street lamp, impede the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or
obstruct the view of any street intersection. In such situations there shall be
a clear space of 13 feet, six inches above the surface of the street or seven
feet above the sidewalk. Owners shall remove all dead, diseased, or dangerous
trees or broken or decayed limbs which may constitute a threat to public safety
when they interfere with the proper spread of light along the street from a
street light or interfere with visibility of any traffic control device or
sign. If said owners fail to prune trees as required under this section, the
city may provide written notice, via regular mail or via a posting on the
property, advising the owners to conduct appropriate pruning. If the pruning is
not conducted within 25 calendar days after receipt of notice, the city may
conduct the pruning and assess the costs to the owners, for which a lien may
attach, if payment is not received by the city within 30 days after notice of
the costs assessed to the owners.

including any shade or ornamental tree along sidewalks or other public ways of
the city, or remove any public tree in the city including any shade or
ornamental tree along sidewalks or other public ways of the city without first
obtaining written permission from the Forestation Board, in consultation with a
professional arborist or professional forester if deemed appropriate. No person
shall excavate any ditches, tunnels, trenches or create a new driveway within a
radius of 15 feet from any public tree, without first obtaining written
permission from the Forestation Board.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any utility to trim any tree located in the
public right-of-way within the city without first contacting the Forestation
Board to give them detailed information regarding the scope of the work to be
performed. In some cases, a meeting with the City Forester may be necessary.

be the least detrimental to the health of a tree or trees where consistent with
the requirements of the appropriate safety code in effect in the Commonwealth
of Kentucky.

§ 97.17 NOMINATIONS FOR DESIGNATION OF PROTECTED OR HISTORIC TREES.
   Any owner of lands within the City of Prospect, including the city itself,
may nominate a tree on their land to be designated as a "protected tree" or
"historic tree" as defined in this chapter. Nominations for such designations
shall be submitted to the Forestation Board in writing and be accompanied by
documentation supporting the designation. The Forestation Board may conduct
hearings on protected or historic tree nominations. The Forestation Board shall
make their determination regarding designation within 90 days from receipt of
the written nomination or within 45 days after a final hearing regarding
designation, whichever date occurs later. The designation of a tree as a
"protected tree" or "historic tree" shall attach to and run with the land as a
binding designation for subsequent owners. However, nothing shall prevent a
landowner later in time from the owner who originally obtained "protected' or
"historic" designation, from petitioning the Forestation Board to remove such
designation for good cause shown. A record of all trees within the city
designated as "protected" or "historic" shall be kept on file at the Prospect
City Hall and an updated listing of all such trees shall be included in the
annually updated City Tree Plan. The Forestation Board, in its discretion, may
require as a condition of determining a tree or trees to be "protected" or
"historic," that the landowner requesting such designation agree to the city
recording a document signed by said landowner requesting that the designated
tree or trees be included in a written covenant running with title to the land.

permission from the Forestation Board, in consultation with a professional
arborist or professional forester if deemed appropriate. No person or business
shall excavate any ditches, tunnels, trenches or lay any driveway within a
radius of 20 feet from any "protected" or "historic" tree, without first
obtaining written permission from the Forestation Board, in consultation with a
professional arborist or professional forester if deemed appropriate.

§ 98.05 ALLOWANCE OF AND TIME FRAMES FOR STORAGE CONTAINERS ON PROPERTY.

Limitations on the amount of time temporary portable storage containers are
permitted to remain on residential property shall be as follows:
      (1)   Time allowed. A permit for the location of a portable storage
container on residential property shall be issued for a maximum of five days.
      (2)   Permitting subsequent to placement of storage container. The city,
upon observing an un-permitted residential portable storage container, shall
provide written or verbal notification to the landowner or any agent of the
source supplying the container of the need for a permit. There shall be
subtracted from the number of days allowable for the permit, two days for each
day the portable storage container is located on the property without a valid
permit, running from the time the landowner or container supplier receives
written notice of the need to obtain a permit. Thus, if the container is placed
on the property one day before the permit is issued, the issuance and
expiration period for a residential portable storage container will be three
days.
      (3)   Return of container for unloading. When a portable storage
container is returned to residential property for the purpose of unloading,
another permit must be obtained from the city. The initial delivery of the
container for the purpose of loading and its return for unloading shall be
counted as one event.
      (4)   Limitation on number of permits. No more than two events involving
four required permits shall be issued for the location of a portable storage
container on the same residential lot during a 12-month period where the lot is
under the same ownership. However, the City Administrator may, upon written
documentation of circumstances involving fire damage, water damage, weather
damage, personal emergency of the landowner, or other similar extraordinary
circumstance, allow up to four events involving eight required permits on the
same residential lot during said 12-month period where the property is under
the same ownership.
   (B)   Temporary portable storage containers in commercial areas. Limitations
on the amount of time temporary portable storage containers are permitted to
remain on commercial property shall be as follows:
      (1)   Time allowed. A permit for the location of a commercial portable

      (2)   Permitting subsequent to placement of container. The city, upon
observing an un-permitted commercial portable storage container, shall provide
written or verbal notification to the business owner, business manager, and/or
any agent of the source supplying the container of the need for a permit. There
shall be subtracted from the number of days allowable for the permit, two days
for each day the portable storage container is located on the property without
a valid permit, running from the time the landowner or container supplier
receives written notice of the need to obtain a permit. Thus, if the container
is placed on the property two days before the permit is issued, the issuance
and expiration period for a commercial portable storage container will be six
days.
      (3)   Return of container for unloading. When a portable storage
container is returned to commercial property for the purpose of unloading,
another permit must be obtained from the city. The initial delivery of the
container for the purpose of loading and its return for unloading shall be

      (4)   Limitations on number of permits.  No more than two events
involving four required permits shall be issued for the location of a portable
storage container on the same commercial lot during a 12-month period where the
lot is under the same ownership. However, the City Administrator may, upon

weather damage, or similar extraordinary circumstance, allow up to four events
involving eight required permits on the same commercial lot during said 12-
month period where the property is under the same ownership.

remain on residential property shall be as follows:
      (1)   Time allowed. A permit for the location of a portable trash
container on residential property shall be issued for a maximum of 14 days.
Permits may be renewed at the discretion of the City Administrator for a period
up to seven days upon receipt of written documentation showing continued
substantial progress on the project necessitating the trash container. If such
a showing is not made, the trash container shall be removed and may be brought
back to the site only when it can be demonstrated that such progress is able to
be resumed.
      (2)   Permitting subsequent to placement of container. The city, upon
observing an un-permitted residential portable trash container, shall provide
written or verbal notification to the landowner or any agent of the source
supplying the container of the need for a permit. There shall be subtracted
from the number of days allowable for the permit, two days for each day the
portable trash container is located on the property without a valid permit,
running from the time the landowner or container supplier receives written
notice of the need to obtain a permit. Thus, if the container is placed on the
property two days before the permit is issued, the issuance and initial
expiration period for a residential portable trash container will be ten days.
      (3)   Limitation on number of permits. No more than two permits shall be
issued for the location of a portable trash container on the same residential
lot during a 12-month period where the lot is under the same ownership.

emergency of the landowner, or other similar extraordinary circumstance, allow
up to four permits on the same residential lot during said 12-month period
where the property is under the same ownership.

container on commercial property shall be issued for a maximum of 28 days.
Permits may be renewed at the discretion of the City Administrator for a period
up to 14 days upon receipt of written documentation showing continued

a showing is not made, the trash container shall be removed and may be brought
back to the site only when it can be demonstrated that such progress is able to
be resumed.
      (2)   Permitting subsequent to placement of container. The city, upon
observing an un-permitted commercial portable trash container, shall provide
written or verbal notification to the business owner, business manager, and/or
any agent of the source supplying the container of the need for a permit. There
shall be subtracted from the number of days allowable for the permit, one day
for each day the portable trash container is located on the property without a
valid permit, running from the time the business owner, business manager or
container supplier receives written notice of the need to obtain a permit.
Thus, if the container is placed on the property two days before the permit is
issued, the issuance and initial expiration period for a commercial portable
trash container will be 26 days.
      (3)   Limitation on number of permits. No more than two permits shall be
issued for the location of a portable trash container for the use of a
commercial establishment at the same location during a 12-month period where
the commercial establishment is under the same ownership. However, the City
Administrator may, upon written documentation of circumstances involving fire

circumstance, allow up to three permits at the same location during said 12-
month period where the commercial establishment is under the same ownership.

§ 113.09 OVERPAYMENT OF INSURANCE COMPANY LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   Time for making claim of overpayment; loss of claim. An insurance
company which has paid to the city the license fee for the privilege of
engaging in the business of insurance within the corporate limits of the city,
as required by this chapter, and which believes it has paid an amount in excess
of the amount due, shall notify the city of such claim by delivering notice to
the Chief Administrative Officer in the form described in division (B) of this
section, within 365 days of the date which said fee was paid. Failure of an
insurance company to deliver notice in the required form within such time shall
forever bar any claim of overpayment by the insurance company.
   (B)   Elements of claim. The notice delivered to the city shall contain the
following elements:
      (1)   Name and principal place of business of the insurance company at
the time the license fee in question was paid and at the time notice was made.
      (2)   As to the license fee in question; the amount of license fee paid;
the date upon which the license fee was paid; and, the date upon which the
license fee was due.
      (3)   A statement that the insurance company believes that the amount of
the license fee it paid is incorrect.
      (4)   A statement identifying the amount which the insurance company
believes is the correct license fee.
      (5)   A detailed explanation identifying each element of the calculation
which led to the determination of the amount of the license fee which the
insurance company paid, and each element which leads to the determination of
the amount of license fee which the insurance company believes is correct.
      (6)   A detailed explanation identifying the alleged error in calculating
the license fee which the insurance company paid and how the alleged error
arose.
   (C)   Review of claim. The Chief Administrative Officer of the city shall
review the notice submitted by the insurance company and determine the correct
amount of license fee due for the specified period. The Office shall then
notify the insurance company of the Officer's determination.
   (D)   Results following review.
      (1)   If the Chief Administrative Officer determines that an overpayment
was made, the insurance company may recover the amount of overpayment as
determined by the Officer only as a credit in calculating the license fee due
for the calendar quarter following the date of the Officer's determination. If
the amount of license fee which would be due in said quarter, without
consideration of the credit, is less than the credit, the insurance company
shall make use of such portion of the credit as is necessary to reduce the
license fee for the quarter to zero. Any unused portion of the credit shall be
carried forward and applied, to the maximum amount possible, in each subsequent
quarter until the credit is exhausted.
      (2)   If, however, the insurance company has ceased doing business at the
time of the notice of overpayment, the insurance company shall be entitled to
receive the amount of overpayment as calculated by the Officer in the form of a
refund from the city. If the amount of refund exceeds $25,000, the city, in its
discretion, may refund the entire amount in a single payment or may refund the
amount as four equal payments paid one per quarter for the following four
quarters.
      (3)   If the Chief Administrative Officer for the city determines that no
overpayment was made, the Officer shall notify the insurance company of such
determination.
      (4)   In no event shall the insurance company be entitled to interest on
any overpayment.

revocation of the license issued to an insurance company or agent under the
provisions of KRS Chapter 304 or may result in other penalties being imposed by

      (1)   For the purpose of this section the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         (a)   BUILDING. A structure having a roof supported by columns or
walls and for the shelter or enclosure of persons, animals, materials, or
property of any
kind and when separated by a division wall without openings, each portion of
that building shall be deemed a separate BUILDING.
         (b)   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected, other than signs the
use of which requires location on the ground or its being permanently attached
to something having a location on the ground; it includes, but is not limited
to, swimming pools, signs, barns, and other outbuildings and poles of a height
of 15 feet or more and exterior lighting fixtures.
      (2)   The terms STRUCTURE and BUILDING are meant to be used
interchangeably throughout this subchapter and all divisions of this section
using one of these terms shall also pertain to the other.

      (1)   (a)   A full set of nonreturnable, detailed plans and
specifications for the construction of any building or addition to any existing

authorized representative, prior to any construction of that structure,
addition, remodeling, or demolition.
         (b)   All plans submitted for approval shall contain a drawing or plat
showing the lot plan, the location of the building on the lot, accurate
dimensions of the building and lot, and any other information as may be
required by the City Council. This plat shall be prepared after the lot has
been staked by a competent surveyor. Although staking is permitted, it is to be
understood that this action does not assure issuance of a building permit and
that work is not to be so construed.
         (c)   The Mayor, or any person(s) appointed by the Mayor, shall
consider those plans to determine whether the proposed building will adversely
affect the public safety, health, convenience, comfort, aesthetics and general
welfare of the residents of the city and check to see if the plans are in
compliance with the restrictions applicable to all property located in the
city. The following standards of review shall apply in nonresidential areas in
determining whether any proposed building or structure is in compliance with
this chapter:
            1.   Architectural.
               a.   Brick or stone shall be the principal material for all
exterior walls. All buildings within
a development shall be of the same brick or stone. Applicant shall submit

main entry fencing and gates. No wood may be used, except for gates necessary
for access which shall have 100% opaqueness. Buffer zones shall be buffered by

consist of a continuous concrete curb.
               g.   An applicant will maintain landscaping as approved by the
city at all times.
            3.   Application for approval by the city. All applications for
approval by the city pursuant to this section, shall be filed with the City
Clerk, and action on same shall be taken within 60 days after the date of
filing. Upon filing of the application, the city shall determine whether the
application is in conformance with the standards set forth above and shall
approve same only upon said finding, and otherwise reject said application
unless a variance is granted upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary to afford relief upon a showing of good and sufficient cause,
a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not
adversely impact the intent and purposes of this section.
      (2)   When the detailed plans and specifications are approved by the City
Council, or its duly authorized representative, or an Architectural Review
Committee appointed by the Council, a preliminary certificate of conformance to
city regulations shall be issued.
      (3)   Upon issuance of the preliminary certificate of conformance, the

representative, and upon payment of necessary fees and the posting of a clean-
up deposit the approval of the city shall be granted and recorded. The granting
of city approval shall be indicated by suitable stamping of the county building

this section, the Police Chief or the duly authorized representative of the
City Council shall order all excavating, construction, and such to immediately
cease until that time as a permit is properly issued. Violation of this section
shall also subject the violator to fine as subsequently outlined.
