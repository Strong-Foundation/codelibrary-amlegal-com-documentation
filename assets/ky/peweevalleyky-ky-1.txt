repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of Council as long as the
repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the original
amendment.

have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or amendment
as the case may be.

arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 31.01 OATH.
   Each officer of the city shall, before entering upon the discharge of duties
of his or her office, take the following oath: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm,
as the case may be) that I will support the Constitution of this Commonwealth,
and the Constitution of the United States, and be faithful and true to the
Commonwealth of Kentucky, so long as I continue a citizen thereof, and that I
will faithfully execute, to the best of my ability, the office of           ,
according to law; and I do further solemnly swear (or affirm) that, since the
adoption of the present Constitution, I being a citizen of this United States,
have not fought a duel with deadly weapons within this State, nor out of it,
nor have I sent or accepted a challenge to fight a duel with deadly weapons,
nor have I acted as a second in carrying a challenge, nor aided or assisted any
person thus offending, so help me God,” as established by § 228 of the Kentucky
Constitution.
§ 31.02 COMPENSATION.
   (A)   City Council shall establish the compensation of every elected city
officer not later than the first Monday in May in the year in which the officer
is elected. An elected officer’s compensation shall not be changed after his or
her election or during his or her term of office.
      (1)   In order to equate the compensation of Mayors and Council members
with the purchasing power of the dollar, the Department of Local Government
computes by the second Friday in February of every year the annual increase or
decrease in the consumer price index of the preceding year by using 1949 as the
base year in accordance with § 246 of the Constitution of Kentucky, which
provides that the Mayor in cities of the first class shall be paid at a rate no
greater than $12,000 per annum and Mayors in cities other than the first class
and Council members shall be paid at a rate no greater than $7,200 per annum.
      (2)   The City Council shall set the compensation of these officers in
accordance with KRS 83A.070 at a rate no greater than that stipulated by the
Department of Local Government.
   (B)   The legislative body shall fix the compensation of city employees and
nonelected city officers in accordance with a personnel and pay classification
plan, which shall be adopted by ordinance.
   (C)   All fees and commissions authorized by law shall be paid into the city
treasury for the benefit of the city and shall not be retained by any officer
or employee.
(Prior Code KOC, § 230.26, passed 2-2-2004)
Case law reference:
   The limits on compensation contained in the Kentucky Constitution are not
absolute limits but rather increase or decrease in accordance with changes in
the consumer price index. See Matthews v Allen, 360 SW2d 248 (1948).
Editor’s note:
   Compensation ordinances are not set forth in this code, but are rather kept
on file and available for public inspection in the office of the City Clerk-
Treasurer.

§ 34.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)   Any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a request for inspection at the office of the City Clerk during
regular office hours, except during legal holidays. The official custodian, or
the custodian acting under the authority of the official custodian, may require
a request to inspect public records to be in writing, signed by the applicant
and with the applicant’s name printed legibly on the application. A written
request to inspect public records may be presented by hand delivery, mail or
via facsimile, if 1 is available.
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in compliance
with this chapter and the open records law, and the requested public records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection. A person may inspect public records at the designated office of the
city during the regular office hours, or in appropriate cases, by receiving
copies of the records through the mail.
   (C)   If the public records are to be inspected at the offices of the city,
suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk or
in another office of the city as determined by the official custodian or
custodian for the inspection. No person shall remove original copies of public
records from the offices of the city without the written permission of the
official custodian of the record. When public records are inspected at the city
offices, the person inspecting the records shall have the right to make
abstracts and memoranda of the public records and to obtain copies of all
written public records. When copies are requested, the custodian may require
advance payment of the prescribed fee.
   (D)   Upon proper request, the city shall mail copies of the public records
to a person whose residence or principal place of business is located outside
of the county after the person precisely describes the public records which are
readily available and after the person pays in advance the prescribed fee.
§ 34.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.

(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 34.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time and date for inspection or mailing of the public
records, not to exceed 3 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies thereof. However, refusal under this section must be sustained by
clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
    The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and

request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued

and advance payment of the prescribed fee, including postage where appropriate.
If the applicant desires copies of public records other than written records,
the custodian of the records shall duplicate the records or permit the
applicant to duplicate the records; however, the custodian shall ensure that
such duplication will not damage or alter the original records.
   (B)   (1)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall
be available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.

less than 8-1/2 inches x 11 inches in at least 1 color on white paper, or for

electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and the format conforms
to the requestor’s requirements, the public record may be provided in this
alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.

media and any mechanical processing cost incurred by the public agency, but not
including the cost of staff required. If a public agency is asked to produce a
record in a nonstandardized format, or to tailor the format to meet the request
of an individual or a group, the public agency may at its discretion provide
the requested format and recover staff costs as well as any actual costs
incurred.
   (B)   (1)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee.
      (2)   The public agency from which copies of nonexempt public records are
requested for a commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the
requestor stating the commercial purpose for which they shall be used, and may
require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract
shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a
specified fee.
      (3)   The fee provided for in division (B)(1) of this section may be
based on 1 or both of the following:

pursuant to §
34.13;
   (B)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use of
the public record for a different commercial purpose; or

of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical, radio
or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed the

publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874(5)) Penalty, see §
10.99

these agreements.

the job, every police officer shall undergo and pass a physical examination,
including hearing, vision and drug tests as a condition of initial employment,

existence of the inquiry, and, at its discretion, make public any documents
which were issued to either party.

reduce the conclusion to writing, and transmit a copy of its decision to the
complainant and to all officers or employees against whom the complaint was

assessed in accordance with state law have not been paid, the motor vehicle and
its contents, except as set forth in division (B) of this section, may be sold
to pay the charges after the owner and any lienholder have been notified by
certified mail at the address specified in state law, ten days prior to the
time and place of the sale. If the proceeds of the sale of any vehicle pursuant
to this section are insufficient to satisfy accrued charges, the sale and
collection of proceeds shall not constitute a waiver or release of

the towing company or storage facility seeks to obtain a new title free and

letter is not sent within the ten days by the towing and storage company, then
only ten days of storage may be charged. The lien holder has the right to take
possession of the motor vehicle after showing proof of lien still enforced, and
paying the reasonable or agreed towing and storage charges on the motor
vehicle. If a lienholder does not exercise the right to take possession of the
motor vehicle under this division within 45 days of notification, and all
lienholders agree in writing, the tow company or storage facility may obtain a
new title under state law free and clear of all liens, excluding tax liens.
Nothing in this section shall allow the transfer of a vehicle subject to a
lien, except as provided in KRS 186A.190.
      (4)   If there are no lienholders required to be notified under state
law, and the owner does not exercise the right to take possession of the motor
vehicle under this section within 45 days of notification required under state

the areas using the Kentucky Department of Highways Specification Material;
asphaltic concrete base. After tack coat has been installed and allowed to
reach the tacky stage as provided above, a course or courses of the total
thickness to match the existing pavement section of Class I Type “A” Bituminous
Concrete or equivalent shall be constructed in accordance with all provisions
of the Kentucky Department of Transportation Specifications 402. This base
material shall be placed and thoroughly compacted in not more than four (4")

the case may be; otherwise the order appealed from shall become final.
§ 110.09 EXEMPTIONS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any business, occupation
or profession which is exempt from municipal licensing and/or license taxes
pursuant to state or federal law.
§ 110.10 SHORT-TERM RENTALS.
   (A)   The City Council finds that the size of many homes and lots being used
for short-term rental in Pewee Valley creates an unwanted and inappropriate
opportunity for the short-term rentals to become large event spaces.
   (B)   The City Council hereby finds that the impact of traffic, noise and
transient persons from these potentially large events is inappropriate for the
city and cannot be mitigated.
   (C)   Therefore, no person, firm or corporation shall own or operate a
short-term rental on any premises (whether it is the personal residence of the
owner or not), within the city, unless the property is zoned C-2, C-3, or C-4,
which allows hotels and motels as a Permitted Use.
(Ord. 2020-5, passed 8-3-2020; Am. Ord. 2021-1, passed 2-1-2021) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $500.
   (B)   Any person who operates a short-term rental shall be issued a citation
by an enforcement officer designated by the city and ordered to cease
operations. Violation of §
110.10 (including advertising for short-term rental without a license) carries
a penalty of not less than $150 for first offense and $400 per day for each day
of violation thereafter. Each day of such violation(s) shall constitute a
separate offense.
In addition to the penalties provided herein, the city is authorized to pursue
remedial civil actions for violations of §
110.10 by civil complaint or petition for injunctive relief, declaration of
rights or other appropriate proceedings filed in the Oldham County, Kentucky
Circuit Court.

§ 113.01 SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter governs the regulation of rates for basic service and equipment
within the City of Pewee Valley, Kentucky (“City”) for any franchisee which has
been notified that (a) the city has been certified to regulate its basic
service and equipment rates; and (b) the city has adopted regulations governing
regulation of basic service and equipment rates. The provisions set forth below
are intended to be consistent with all Federal Communications Commission
(“FCC”) regulations governing the regulation of basic service rates and
equipment, and the city will regulate and interpret its rules so that they are
consistent with FCC regulations, as if those regulations were set forth in full
herein; the franchisee is prohibited from engaging in any activity it is
prohibited in engaging in under FCC rules, as if those rules were set forth in
full herein. For purposes of these provisions, the term “basic service” at
Title 47 C.F.R. § 76.901 and the term “equipment” refers to all equipment and
services subject to regulation under Title 47 C.F.R. § 76.923.
(Prior Code KOC, § 610.4, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 113.02 FILING AND REVIEW OF RATES.
   (A)   Initial filings by franchisees.
      (1)   Filings; when made. A franchisee that is notified that its basic
service and equipment rates are subject to regulation must file a submission
(“the rate filing”) within 30 days of the notification (but no earlier than
November 15, 1993), justifying its then-existing basic service and equipment
rates. All rates, for all customer classifications must be justified. Once a
franchisee has been so notified by the city that its rates are subject to
regulation, it may not thereafter increase its rates for basic service or
equipment without the prior approval of the city. This requirement applies in
all cases, including with respect to increases in rates announced prior to the
date the operator was notified its rates were subject to regulation where the
increases were not implemented prior to the date of notice. A franchisee must
submit a rate filing to justify any increase in basic service or equipment
rates or any new basic service or equipment rate (collectively referred to
herein as rate increases). An “increase” occurs when there is an increase in
rates or decrease in program or customer services. Rate filings proposing and
supporting rate increases must be filed for review at least 30 days in advance
of the proposed effective date of the increase. This requirement does not alter
or eliminate any other notice requirement.
      (2)   Filings; where made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the
city’s Cable Rate Commission (“C.R.C.”). A rate filing shall be considered
filed for review on the date the required rate filing and all required copies
are received by the C.R.C. Four copies of each rate filing (including all
supporting materials) must be submitted. If the operator claims any part of the
filing is proprietary, it shall additionally file 8 copies which omit the
proprietary information.
      (3)   Filing; contents. Subject to any FCC regulations governing the
burden of proof, a rate filing submitted by a franchisee must show that the
rates the franchisee proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are
reasonable. Except as inconsistent with FCC rules:
         (a)   Every rate filing must clearly state in a covering letter
whether it justifies existing rates; or proposes an increase in rates. The
covering letter must also identify any rate that is derived in whole or in part
based upon cost of service and identify any pages of the rate filing that
contain information that the franchisee claims is proprietary. It must state
whether any part of the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment
or an alleged increase in external costs. The covering letter should also
contain a brief, narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in
service.
         (b)   The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially.
         (c)   The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms and these
forms must be correctly completed.
         (d)   If different rates are proposed for basic service for different
classes of customers, the filing must show that the classifications and the
differences in the rate charged are reasonable and consistent with federal law.
      (4)   Establishment of rate. If the franchisee seeks to support a rate
based upon a cost of service, the city will establish a rate that provides the
franchisee an opportunity to recover the reasonable costs associated with
providing basic cable service, including a reasonable profit. An expense or
investment is not presumed reasonable merely because the franchisee has
incurred or made it. A franchisee is not entitled to recover monopoly profits
in any form.
      (5)   Cost of service analysis. In addition to information the city
requires the franchisee to provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this
provision, a franchisee who seeks to justify all or any part of its rates based
upon its cost of service must submit a complete cost of service analysis that
shows all expenses it incurs and all revenues derived from the system, directly
or indirectly by the franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator
of the system within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 522(5). The cost of service
must identify the accounting level (as that term is used in the FCC’s
regulations) at which each expense or revenue identified was aggregated and
show clearly how the expense or revenue was allocated. The franchisee may not
include costs at an accounting level unless it also includes all revenues from
that same level attributable to the system or to a group of systems, of which
the system serving the city is a part. The replacement cost of a comparable
system must be identified and supported. The franchisee must identify the name
and address of any entity with which it has a contract, other than a
programmer, which derives revenues from the system and must state whether and
how the revenues of that entity were included in the cost of service. In
addition, the cost of service shall clearly show the derivation of a proposed
charge per channel and the application of that charge to yield a basic service
rate. It must also show and support the derivation and allocation of any
amounts included in the derivation of the rate for:
         (a)   Operation and maintenance expenses;
         (b)   Administrative and general expenses;
         (c)   Programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs
and copyright fees separately);
         (d)   Costs for PEG access and any institutional network;
         (e)   Franchise fee expenses;
         (f)   Investment in the system and associated depreciation;
         (g)   Other expenses, including federal, state and local taxes,
itemized; and
         (h)   The proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid
by the franchisee.
      (6)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee is not required to
submit the cost of service specified in division (A)(5) above for equipment
rates, and instead initially shall complete, submit and support the costs of
equipment using applicable FCC forms. Any cost of service submitted to justify
basic service rates must show that the cost of service does not include
equipment costs.
   (B)   Initial city review.
      (1)   After receiving a rate filing, the C.R.C. promptly shall publish a
notice that a filing has been received and that, except for those parts which
may be withheld as proprietary, it is available for public review. The notice
shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall
provide interested parties 7 days to submit written comments on the filing to
the C.R.C. The C.R.C. shall submit the comments received and its
recommendations for action to the City Council no later than 20 days after the
filing and shall make those recommendations available for public inspection.
The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff
recommendations, but must do so no later than 3 business days after the staff
recommendations are submitted to the City Council. The response shall be filed
with the C.R.C., and if submitted in a timely fashion, the C.R.C. shall forward
a copy to the City Council.
      (2)   Within 30 days of the date of the filing, the City Council shall
issue a written order, which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed
rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or
tolling the proposed rate in whole or part. If the City Council tolls the rate
in whole or in part, its written order at a minimum shall explain that it
requires additional time to review the rate filing and state that the
franchisee may cure any deficiency in its filing by submitting a supplementary
filing as provided in division (C) below. With respect to existing rates,
tolling means the rates may remain in effect, subject to refund; with respect
to rate changes, tolling means the portion of the rate change that is tolled
may not go into effect.
   (C)   Supplementary filings.
      (1)   If a proposed rate is tolled in whole or in part, the franchisee
shall submit a supplementary filing 20 days from the effective date of the
tolling order, containing corrections, if any, to its filing (including any
required supplement to its cost of service filing) and any response to
information filed by interested parties or to the recommendations of the staff,
or any additional information necessary to support the proposed rate.
Supplementary filings must be filed in accordance with division (A)(2) above.
      (2)   A supplementary filing also must contain such information as the
city directs the franchisee to provide.
      (3)   In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to
provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee
who claims that it is entitled to a rate in whole or in part based upon the
adjustments for inflation and external costs contemplated by Title 47 C.F.R. §
76.922(d)(2) and (3) must submit the following:
         (a)   A calculation showing how each part of the adjustment was
derived;
         (b)   A statement itemizing each external cost (as defined by FCC
regulations), the amount of that external cost for the 2 calendar years prior
to the date of the filing and the year-to-date in which the filing is made; and
the projected amount of the external cost for the remainder of the year in
which the filing is made and for the following calendar year; (The statement
must specifically show any increases in revenues from programming services.
“Revenues” include all revenues, in whatever form received.)
         (c)   If the increase is attributable to any increase in programming
service costs, the contract for each programming service whose cost has
increased; a sworn statement identifying each programming service whose costs
increased where the programmer is an affiliate of the franchisee (as defined by
FCC regulations); and, for any contract that has been in effect less than 12
months, the prior contract for the service;
         (d)   A sworn statement by the franchisee’s chief financial officer or
an independent, certified accountant stating that he or she has examined all
external costs (including all programming costs) and has offset against any
increase claimed, the amount of any decreases in external costs, and the amount
by which any increase in external costs was below the GNP-PI, as required by
Title 47 C.F.R. § 76.922, or any applicable, superceding regulation; affirming
that the franchisee has only sought to recover any external cost to the extent
that cost exceeded the GNP-PI; and affirming that the franchisee has not
attempted to recover any increase in the cost of programming purchased by an
affiliate except as provided in 47 C.F.R. § 76.922, or any applicable,
superceding regulation.
      (4)   Upon receiving the supplementary filing, the C.R.C. promptly shall
publish a notice that a filing has been received and that it is available for
public review (except those parts which may be withheld as proprietary). The
notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall
provide interested parties 20 days to submit written comments on the filing to
the C.R.C. The C.R.C. shall submit the comments received and its
recommendations for action to the City Council no later than 30 days prior to
the date the City Council must act under division (C)(7) below.
      (5)   The recommendations shall be made available for public inspection.
The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff
recommendations, but must do so no later than 10 days after the staff
recommendations are submitted to the City Council. The response shall be filed
with the C.R.C., and if submitted in a timely fashion, the C.R.C. shall forward
a copy to the City Council.
      (6)   The City Council shall issue a written order, which may be in any
lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the
proposed rate in whole or in part; or allowing the rate to go into effect in
whole or in part, subject to refund. If the City Council issues an order
allowing the rates to go into effect subject to refund, it shall also direct
the franchisee to maintain an accounting in accordance with Title 47 C.F.R. §
76.933.
      (7)   The order specified in division (C)(5) above shall be adopted
within 90 days after the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justifies
based on the FCC benchmark. The order shall be adopted within 150 days of the
tolling order for any rate the franchisee justified with a cost of service
showing.
(Prior Code KOC, § 610.4, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 113.03 PROVISION GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO RATE ORDERS.
   (A)   Any rate order of the City Council shall be issued and effective upon
adoption. Each rate order shall be released to the public and the franchisee.
In any case where the City Council approves, denies or tolls a rate; orders
that a rate may go into effect subject to refund; or orders refunds or
establishes rates, a public notice shall be published stating that the order
has issued and is available for review. Any such order shall be in writing.
   (B)   The City Council may take any steps that it is not prohibited from
taking by federal law to protect the public interest as part of any rate order
or by any other means. By way of illustration and not limitation, it may
require refunds, set rates and impose forfeitures and penalties directly or
through its delegated representatives and enforce refund orders. Any order
prescribing a rate must explain why the franchisee’s proposed rate was
unreasonable and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However, before
prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to subscribers, the City Council shall
ensure the franchisee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed
rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the C.R.C. propose a refund or a
rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation to the franchisee at the time
it is submitted to City Council shall be deemed to provide the franchisee this
notice and the franchisee must comment on the refund or rate in its response to
the recommendations.
   (C)   No order approving or setting a rate using the FCC benchmarks shall be
interpreted to establish the just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every
such rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and
refund to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the
same may be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not
limitation, should the FCC reduce the benchmarks, the city shall have the right
to reduce a franchisee’s rates and to require the franchisee to refund any
amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by
federal law.
(Prior Code KOC, § 610.4, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 113.04 FRANCHISEE DUTIES.
   (A)   A franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including
prospective rate reductions and refunds, within 60 days of the date the City
Council issues an order mandating a remedy.
   (B)   Within 90 days of the date an order mandating a remedy is issued, a
franchisee must file a certification, signed by an authorized representative of
the cable company stating:
      (1)   Whether the franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of
the City Council’s order;
      (2)   Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the
City Council’s order; and
      (3)   Showing how refunds (including interest) were calculated and
distributed.
   (C)   It is each franchisees’ responsibility to keep books and records of
account so that it can refund any amounts owed to subscribers.
   (D)   It is each franchisees’ duty to submit as complete a filing as
possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing that is
incomplete under applicable law shall be treated as an evasion of this chapter.
   (E)   Information requests records of revenues or expenses that are
allocated to the franchisee’s system must respond to requests for information
from the city by deadlines established by the city. A franchisee is:
      (1)   A franchisee and any other entity that has responsible for ensuring
that such other entity responds to the city’s requests.
      (2)   Because federal law limits the time available for an initial
response to a filing by a franchisee, before the order contemplated by §
113.02(B) issues, the franchisee must be prepared to respond to requests for
information regarding its filing within 5 days of the date an information
request is mailed to it. The information may include the information the
franchisee would be required to provide as part of any supplementary filing.
(Prior Code KOC, § 610.4, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 113.05 DUTIES OF CABLE RATE COMMISSION.
   (A)   The C.R.C. shall be responsible for administering the provisions
herein.
   (B)   Without limitation and by way of illustration:
      (1)   C.R.C. shall ensure notices are given to the public and each
franchisee as required herein and by FCC regulations.
      (2)   C.R.C. may submit requests for information to the franchisee and
establish deadlines for response to them, as provided in §
113.04.
      (3)   For good cause, the C.R.C. may waive any provision herein or extend
any deadline for filing or response except as to such matters that are
mandatory under FCC regulations.
      (4)   C.R.C. shall rule on any request for confidentiality.
      (5)   C.R.C. shall prepare the recommendations to the City Council
contemplated by §
113.02(B) and (C). If the C.R.C. recommends that any increase be denied in
whole or in part, it shall:
         (a)   Propose a rate and explain the basis for its recommendation (it
may propose that rates remain at existing levels); and
         (b)   Recommend whether and on what basis refunds should issue; and
         (c)   Notify the franchisee of its recommendation at the time it is
submitted to the Council.
(Prior Code KOC, § 610.4, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 113.06 PENALTIES AND FORFEITURES.
   Except as prohibited by federal law, a franchisee shall remain subject to
penalties and forfeitures under the city’s Ord. 1982-1, which originally
granted the franchise, and its request for approval of a rate may be denied if
it:
   (A)   Knowingly submits false or fraudulent information to the city in
connection with any rate proceeding;
   (B)   Fails to comply with any lawful order or request of the city,
including, but not limited to a request for information or an order setting
rates; or
   (C)   Evades or attempts to evade federal or local rate regulation; provided
that, filing for approval of a rate that is later determined to be unreasonable
is not in and of itself an evasion of federal or local rate regulation.
(Prior Code KOC, § 610.4, passed 11-1-1993)
§ 113.07 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   (A)   If these provisions, or any request for information requires the
production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the
information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is
submitted, a franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its
response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The
request must state the reason why the information should be treated as
proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for
confidentiality will be granted if the city determines that the preponderance
of the evidence shows that non-disclosure is consistent with the provisions of
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552. The city shall place in a
public file for inspection any decision that results in information being
withheld. If the franchisee requests confidentiality and the request is denied,
(1) where the franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the
proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be returned
to it; or (2) the franchisee may seek review within 5 working days of the
denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
   (B)   (1)   Any interested party may file a request in inspect material
withheld as proprietary with the C.R.C.
      (2)   The C.R.C. shall weigh the policy considerations favoring non-
disclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in light of the
facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the requesting
entity and the cable franchisee that submitted the information as to the
disposition of the request.
      (3)   It may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or
the franchisee may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any
appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.

         (t)   Discharges approved at the discretion of the city
representative.
   (C)   Accidental discharges.
      (1)   In the event of any discharge of a hazardous substance in amounts
that could cause a threat to public drinking supplies, a spill having a
significant adverse impact as defined by the USEPA and Kentucky State Law, or
any other discharge that could constitute a threat to human health or the
environment, as may be asserted by the city, the owner or operator of the
facility shall give notice to the city and the KDOW as soon as practicable, but
in no event later than four hours after discovery of the accidental discharge
or the discharger becomes aware of the circumstances.
      (2)   If an emergency response by governmental agencies is needed, the
owner or operator should call 911 immediately to report the discharge. A
written report must be provided to the city within five days of the time the
discharger becomes aware of the circumstances, unless this requirement is
waived by the city for good cause shown as determined by the city or its
designee on a case-by-case basis, containing the following information:
         (a)   A description of the discharge including volumes and
concentrations;
         (b)   The exact dates and times of discharge; and
         (c)   Steps being taken to eliminate and prevent recurrence of the
discharge.
      (3)   The discharger shall take all reasonable steps to minimize any
adverse impact to the MS4 or the waters of state, including accelerated or
additional monitoring necessary to determine the nature and impact of the
discharge. It shall not be a defense, for the discharger in an enforcement
action, to claim that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the
business or activity of the facility in order to maintain water quality and
minimize any adverse impact that the discharge may cause.

(Ord. 2009-1, passed 5-4-2009)
§ 150.107 POST-CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Water quality management.
      (1)   This section concerning post-construction water quality management
is only applicable when the disturbed area is over one acre.
       (2)   If there is land disturbance over one acre, the permittee shall
complete a permit application that includes a Post-Construction Water Quality
Pollution Prevention Plan (P-SWPPP) to be completed, sealed and signed by a
licensed professional engineer and/or land surveyor as appropriate and
submitted to the city representative.
   (B)   Post-Construction Water Quality Pollution Prevention Plan. A SWQMP
Permit requires a review and submittal of a Post-Construction Water Quality
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). The Post-Construction SWPPP shall include
the following information:
      (1)   A description of the proposed land use including amount of
impervious area, directly connected impervious area and nature of the
development;
      (2)   Location, dimensions, detailed specifications and construction
details of all post-construction water quality Best Management Practices
(BMPs), as defined in the city guidance documents;
      (3)   A sequence describing when each post-construction water quality BMP
will be installed;
      (4)   A Long-Term Operation and Maintenance Agreement containing
maintenance guidelines for all post-construction water quality measures to
facilitate their proper long-term function. This Agreement shall be made
available to future parties, including property owners, who will assume
responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the post-construction water
quality measures;
      (5)   The P-SWPPP shall include provisions for buffers:
         (a)   The waterway buffer will be used to define areas where land
disturbance activities shall be permitted, but construction of any building or
structure shall not be permitted.
         (b)   A waterway buffer shall be applied to all waterways serving more
than 25 acres of tributary area or presented on a United States Geological
Survey map as a blue line stream.
         (c)   The waterway buffer shall be defined as the greater of:
            1.   Area contained within a boundary established by the floodplain
boundary as defined by FEMA or city master planning: or
            2.   Where a floodplain is not defined or calculated, the buffer
will be 25-feet on each side from the top of waterway bank as defined by
geomorphic shape (not by the current water surface elevation).
         (e)   The waterway buffer and floodplain may be used for application
of water quality devices. This may only be permitted if erosion prevention and
sediment control, water quality and cut-fill policies are adequately addressed
as determined by the city according to the provisions of this subchapter.
         (f)   Exemptions are granted so long as erosion prevention and
sediment control, water quality and cut-fill policies are adequately addressed.
Exemptions shall be granted for:
            (a)   Roads and utilities crossing waterways;
            (b)   Pedestrian trails and walkways proximate to waterways; and
            (c)   Other exemptions may be made at the discretion of the city
representative.
      (6)   A licensed professional engineer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky
shall stamp all construction plans and long-term maintenance documentation.
This shall include all proposed improvements or modifications to existing or
new water quality infrastructure and other related improvements or
modifications; and
      (7)   The city may require the posting of a maintenance bond to secure
the structural integrity of the facilities as well as the functioning of the
facilities in accordance with the approved Post-Construction SWPPP for a term
of 24 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. An irrevocable letter
of credit can be used as the financial assurance in lieu of a maintenance bond
although the contribution shall be equivalent to the amount that would be
estimated for the maintenance bond. The maintenance bond shall be calculated as
20% of the estimated construction cost and may be reduced to 10% after 12
months if there are no concerns by the city representative.
   (C)   BMP design requirements and criteria.
      (1)   The city reserves the right to develop or adopt other guidance
documents to serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance
documents distributed by the city should be reviewed and considered when
preparing the Post-Construction SWPPP. These documents may be applied as
standards by which designs are to be prepared and controls implemented.
      (2)   The city shall have authority to implement this subchapter by
appropriate regulations, guidance or other related materials. In this regard,
technical, administrative or procedural matters may be modified as needed to
meet the objectives defined herein, so long as such modifications as to
technical, administrative or procedural matters are not contrary or beyond the
intent of the objectives defined above.
         (a)   Regulations, guidance or other related materials that may be
given authority by this subchapter may include, but are not limited to: Best
Management Practice (BMP) manuals, design regulations and requirements,
submittal checklists, review checklists, inspection checklists, certifications,
water quality management manuals and operation and maintenance manuals;
         (b)   Materials may include information deemed appropriate by the city
including guidance and specifications for the preparation of grading plans,
selecting environmentally sound practices for managing water quality, minimum
specifications and requirements, more complete definitions and performance
standards;
         (c)   The above referenced documents may restrict or prevent the use
of specific products, techniques or management practices (that are to be
accepted by the public or are deemed to have a negative impact on public
infrastructure or the MS4) that have been identified as unacceptable for
performance, maintenance or other technically based reasons; and
         (d)   Documents referenced above may be updated periodically to
reflect the most current and effective practices and shall be made available to
the public. However, the failure to update the manual shall not relieve any
applicant from the obligation to comply with this subchapter, and shall not
prevent the city from imposing the most current and effective practices.
      (3)   The P-SWPPP shall include provisions for water quality BMPs
functioning independently or in combination. Acceptable water quality BMPs
shall be defined by policy and guidance documents as approved by the Water
Quality Board.
      (4)   The P-SWPPP shall include provisions for water quality BMPs that
are designed to achieve the following design/performance objectives:
         (a)   Reduce total suspended solids (TSS) from the first flush as
defined by land use characteristics and contributing area; or, capture and
treatment of at least one-half inch precipitation applied over the contributing
area;
         (b)   Reduce or buffer increases in water runoff temperature caused by
contact with impervious surfaces;
         (c)   Reduce or buffer increases in water runoff volume and flow rate
caused by increases in directly connected impervious area and overall
impervious area; and
         (d)   Water detention/retention facilities shall be designed to
address the rate at which flow is released over the entire runoff discharge
period and the volume of discharge over the critical design-storm period if
defined by city water quality master plans. The outlet structure shall be
designed as a v-notch weir or other multiple stage configurations capable of
controlling the discharge rates for the first flush, two-, ten- and 25-year
design-storm events. The outlet structure shall be designed to safely bypass
the 100-year storm event.
      (5)   Soil bio-engineering, “green” and other “soft” slope and stream
bank stabilization methods shall receive preference over rip rap, concrete and
other hard armoring techniques.
      (6)   Retention supportive data must be submitted to justify the type of
facility selected. If the facility is designed to retain (volume control) all
or a significant portion of runoff (as opposed to temporarily detain), then
appropriate soils analyses findings shall be submitted to the city. This
submission shall also discuss the impacts the facility will have on local karst
topography as found through a geotechnical investigation of the site. The
facility may be designed to infiltrate runoff to groundwater rather than
transmit it downstream under conditions up to a ten-year storm event. It must
be able to bypass all other storms including 100-year event with a discharge
rate equivalent to or less than pre-development conditions without negatively
impacting the 100-year floodplain above or below the site. If data indicates
that the facility cannot retain a significant portion of the runoff (95%), then
the facility must be designed to detain runoff.
      (7)   If available, each P-SWPPP shall be evaluated for consistency with
the Water Quality Master Plan or watershed study for the major watershed or
watersheds within which the project site is located. The individual project
evaluation will determine if water quantity and quality management practices
can adequately serve the property and limit impacts to downstream public and
private properties. The presence of a regional facility(s) will be considered
in determining the extent to which water quantity and/or quality controls will
be necessary.
      (8)   The city reserves the right to require superseding or additional
treatment criteria or objectives for specific pollutant(s) as necessary to meet
overall water quality management program objectives or directives under a
watershed improvement or Total Maximum Daily Load (TDML) program as
administered by the USEPA or Commonwealth of Kentucky.
      (9)   On-site BMP Coordination with regional BMPs.
         (a)   All properties are expected to implement on-site water quality
control measures, but the extent of application may be reduced given the
availability, proximity and nature of regional water quality BMPs.
         (b)   The extent and type of on-site water quality management
practices implemented shall be proportionate to the land use, and proximity to
regional water quality management practices.
   (D)   BMP ownership and easements.
      (1)   Any water management facility or BMP which services individual
property owners shall be privately owned. General routine maintenance
(controlling vegetative growth and removing debris) shall be provided by the
owner(s). The owner shall maintain a perpetual, non-exclusive easement that
allows for access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The
city has the right, but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (2)   Any water quality management facility or BMP which services an
individual residential subdivision in which the facility or BMP is within
designated open areas or serves as an amenity with an established homeowners
association shall be privately owned and maintained consistent with provisions
of this subchapter. The owner shall maintain a perpetual, nonexclusive easement
which allows access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The
city has the right, but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (3)   Any water quality management facility or BMP which services
commercial and industrial development shall be privately owned and maintained.
The owner shall maintain a perpetual, nonexclusive easement which allows access
for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The city has the right,
but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (4)   All regional water quality management control facilities proposed
by the owners, if approved and accepted by the city for dedication as a public
regional facility, shall be publicly owned and/or maintained. All other water
quality management control facilities and BMPs shall be privately owned and/or
maintained unless accepted for maintenance by the city.
      (5)   The city may require dedication of privately owned water quality
facilities, which discharge to the city water quality system. This shall be at
the approval of the City Council.
   (E)   Regional facilities management.
      (1)   The objective of a regional water quality management facility, pond
or other device, is to address the water quality management concerns in a given
watershed with greater economy and efficiency than possible through individual
facilities. The intended result is fewer water quality management facilities to
maintain in the affected watershed while sustaining efficiency.
      (2)   The city encourages regional water quantity and/or quality
management practices, serving 25 to 250 acres of tributary area, which may be
consistently and efficiently managed and maintained. These types of practices
will be encouraged in order to replace or reduce the implementation of on-site
water quantity and/or quality management practices, as determined to be
appropriate by the city.
      (3)   Where a regional water quality management facility has been
established by one or more local governments, or by an authority operating on
behalf of one or more local governments, a development or property may
participate in the program in lieu of runoff control required by this
subchapter. This may be permitted provided that:
         (a)   Runoff from the development drains to an approved existing or
proposed public regional water quality management facility that will be
operational within one year;
         (b)   Participation in the form of contribution of funds, contribution
of land, contribution of quality management facility construction work or a
combination of these, the total value of which shall be in accordance with a
fee schedule adopted by the city;
         (c)   The city finds that the water quality management plans are in
compliance with all other applicable requirements and ordinances; and
         (d)   Each fiscal or in-kind contribution from a development owner
participating in a regional water quality management facility shall be used for
acquisition, design, construction or maintenance of one or more such facilities
in the same watershed in which the development is located.
      (4)   Detention facilities may, and are encouraged, to be designed to
serve multiple purposes. For example, runoff may be detained under wet-weather
conditions, but also serve as common or recreational areas during dry-weather
conditions. Where multi-purpose facilities are provided, or where flat grades
or poorly draining soils are encountered, provisions for adequate low-flow
water quality management system may be required. Where the retention/detention
facility is planned to be used as a lake, pond or water quality management
practice with a permanent pool, water budget calculations shall be performed
and submitted to demonstrate that an adequate permanent pool depth is expected
during dry summer months.
   (F)   Long-term operation and maintenance agreements.
      (1)   Long-term operation and maintenance agreements. Long-Term Operation
and Maintenance Agreements shall include a maintenance plan for all water
quality BMPs in new development or redevelopment that require more than general
maintenance (e.g. periodic mowing).
         (a)   The plan will be developed to ensure that the water quality BMP
(s) is (are) kept functional. The maintenance agreement will specify minimum
operation and maintenance requirements and intervals to be performed by the
property owner.
         (b)   The plan shall address schedules for inspections and techniques
for operation and maintenance including vegetation clearing or mowing and
removing accumulated trash, debris, sediment pollutants and other forms of
pollution.
         (c)   The agreement shall be noted on the final plat with the
appropriate notation on the particular lot(s).
         (d)   The agreement shall be included with property ownership title
documents and shall be binding on the owner, its administrators, executors,
assigns, heirs and any other successors in interest.
         (e)   The format for the Long-Term Operational and Maintenance
Agreement shall be provided through example by the city, or through guidance
documents.
         (f)   Care must be taken to ensure that any required facilities do not
become nuisances or health hazards. Detention and retention facilities should
be designed to require minimal maintenance, and maintenance expectations must
be clearly stated in the Long-Term Operation and Maintenance Agreement.
         (g)   When a water quality BMP serves more than one parcel, a home or
property owners’ association or binding contract for the purpose of operation
and maintenance is required. The owners’ association shall be responsible for
operation and maintenance as directed by this subchapter.
      (2)   Single entity ownership. Where the permanent water quality runoff
control facilities are designed to manage runoff from property in a single
entity ownership, the maintenance responsibility for the water quality control
facilities shall be with the single entity owner.
         (a)   A SINGLE ENTITY shall be defined as an association, public or
private corporation, partnership firm, trust, estate or any other legal entity
allowed to own real estate exclusive of an individual lot owner.
         (b)   The stated responsibilities of the entity shall be documented in
the Long-Term Operation and Maintenance Agreement. Terms including owning,
operating and maintaining the facilities shall be submitted with plans in
application for a SWQMP Permit for an adequacy determination. Approval of a
SWQMP shall be conditioned upon the approval of these terms. These terms shall
be in writing, shall be in recordable form and shall, in addition to any other
terms deemed necessary by the city, contain a provision permitting inspection
at any reasonable time by the city of all facilities deemed critical in the
public welfare.
         (c)   Upon approval of the water quality BMPs by the city, the
facility owner(s) shall demonstrate the ability to guarantee and apply the
financial resources necessary for long-term maintenance requirements. The
funding mechanism shall be in a form approved by the city. The city will only
approve funding mechanism(s) for long-term maintenance responsibilities that
can be demonstrated to be permanent or transferable to another entity with
equivalent longevity.
         (d)   In the event that proposed funding is through an owners’
association, then it must be demonstrated that the association may not dissolve
unless long-term operation and maintenance activities are accepted by another
entity with equivalent longevity and adequate funding. Furthermore, the owners’
association’s responsibility must be stated in the association’s declaration,
covenants or by-laws, as appropriate.
         (e)   Unless made specifically clear in the preliminary stages of the
site design and construction plan review procedure, it will be assumed that all
water detention, retention, treatment or storage facilities and/or devices
shall be owned, operated and maintained by a single entity as defined above.
      (3)   City ownership. Where the city has accepted an offer of dedication
of the permanent water quality BMPs, the city shall be responsible for
operation and maintenance.

representative finds that any person owning or occupying a premises has
violated or is violating this subchapter or order issued hereunder, the
enforcement official may serve, by personal service, or by registered or
certified mail, upon the person a written NOV. Within 30 days of the receipt of
this notice, or shorter period as may be prescribed in the NOV, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, which shall include specific required actions, must be submitted to
the city or its designated representative. Submission of this plan shall in no
way relieve liabilities for violations occurring before or after receipt of the
NOV.
      (6)   Stop work order.
         (a)   In the event compliance cannot be achieved within the terms of a
Notice of Deficiency, Notice of Violation, Permit Suspension or Permit
Revocation, the city may proceed with a stop work order. In the event the city

violations that must be corrected prior to a city inspection for consideration
of removing the stop work order.
         (e)   The permittee shall notify the city in writing of the
anticipated date for completion of the corrective action(s) and provide at
least two normal business days notice for the city to perform a compliance
inspection.
         (f)   When a stop work order is removed, the city shall provide
written notice to the permittee.
      (7)   Permit suspension or revocation.
         (a)   In the event compliance cannot be achieved within the terms of a

permit suspension or revocation.
         (b)   Land-disturbing activities are not allowed on a project site
when a permit has been suspended or revoked other than those required to
address deficiencies/violations.
         (c)   The written permit suspension or revocation shall be hand-
delivered and/or sent by certified mail to the permittee.
         (d)   A permit suspension requires that the permittee submit a revised
portion of SWQMP as indicated by the city for review and acceptance by the city
of the specific issue of contention. When a permit suspension is removed, the
city shall provide written notice to the permittee.
         (e)   When a permit is revoked, the permittee must reapply for a
permit through the process of requesting a new permit.
         (f)   A permit revocation requires that the permittee resubmit a SWQMP
for a full review and acceptance by the city representative.
      (8)   Compliance order. If a person violates the provisions of this
subchapter, the city, or its designated representative, may give notice to the
owner or to any person in responsible charge of the subject property ordering
that unlawful conditions existing thereupon be abated within a schedule defined
from the date of such notice.
         (a)   The enforcement official shall have the authority to establish
elements of a compliance SWQMP and require the owner to implement such a plan
as may be reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes of this subchapter. The
enforcement official may establish the requirements of BMPs.
         (b)   The notice and order may be given, provided that if in the
opinion of the city or its designated representative, the unlawful condition is
such that it is of imminent danger or peril to the public, then the city or its
designated representative shall, with or without notice, proceed to abate the
same, and the cost thereof shall be charged against the property. The city, as
described further in this section, may recover the cost of such actions from
the property owner.
      (9)   Fines. A person that has been found to have been in violation of
any provision of this subchapter, may be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed
the amount presented in this section.
         (a)   The penalty shall increase by 25% of the previous penalty amount
for every subsequent, but separate offense made by the same person. The penalty
shall be in addition to other enforcement actions of this section.
         (b)   The penalty may be assessed for each day, beyond schedules
applied in compliance orders or other schedules issued to the property owner or
other person responsible, for unauthorized activity defined in this section.
         (c)   In determining the amount of the penalty, a penalty schedule may
be developed by the city representative with confirmation by resolution of the
City Council that shall consider the following:
            1.   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to
the public health or to the public or private property resulting from the
violation;
            2.   The duration and gravity of the violation;
            3.   The effect on ground or surface water quality;
            4.   The cost of rectifying the damage;
            5.   The amount of money saved by noncompliance;

comply with the Water Quality Management Program; and
            9.   The costs of enforcement to the city.
         (d)   The maximum fines will be determined by the type of offense.
This indicates the maximum that may be imposed for a first offense and does not
reflect the increases described above for repeat offenses.
            1.   Development without or inconsistent with permit - up to
$7,500. To engage in any development, use, construction, remodeling or other
activity of any nature in any way without all required permits inconsistent
with any approved plan, permit, certificate or other form of authorization
granted for such activity.
            2.   Violation by act or omission - up to $5,000. To violate, by
act or omission, any term, variance, modification, condition or qualification
placed by the city or its designated representative upon any required permit,
certificate or other form of authorization of the use, development or other
activity upon land or improvements thereon.
            3.   Illicit discharge - up to $5,000. Any person who is found to
have improperly disposed of any substance defined as an illicit discharge, not
an allowable discharge or causes the city to be in noncompliance with any
applicable environmental permit.

have improperly disposed of any substance not included in §
150.104(B) that was purchased over-the-counter for household use, in quantities
considered normal for household purposes, which upon discharge to the MS4 or
drainage network would have an adverse impact on water quality or cause the
city to be in noncompliance with any applicable environmental permit.
         (e)   In the event there are penalties assessed by the state against
the city caused by a person, the person shall be assessed the equivalent amount
of civil penalty. This shall include, but is not limited to, penalties for
improper disposal or illegal dumping, or illicit connection into the MS4.
      (10)   Administrative fee. Any person who undertakes any development
activity requiring a Water Quality Management Plan hereunder without first
submitting the plan for review and approval shall pay to the city, in addition
to any permit or inspection fee, an administrative fee which reflects the
actual cost of the corrective action.
      (11)   Order to clean and abate/restore. Any violator may be required to
clean and/or restore land to its condition prior to the violation.
      (12)   Cost recovery. If corrective action is not taken in the time

action abatement and/or restoration shall be borne by the property owner. If
the invoice is not paid within 90 calendar days, the enforcement official shall
have the authority to place a lien upon and against the property.
Alternatively, if the invoice is not satisfied within 90 calendar days, the
enforcement official is authorized to take all legal measures available to
enforce the lien as a judgment, including, without limitation, enforcing the
lien in an action brought for a money judgment, by delivery to the assessor or
a special assessment against the property.
      (13)   Injunctions and/or proceedings at law or in equity.
         (a)   Any violation of this subchapter or of any condition, order,
requirement or remedy adopted pursuant hereto may be restrained, corrected,
abated, mandated or enjoined by other appropriate proceedings pursuant to state
law.
         (b)   The city shall pursue, through a court of component
jurisdiction, any penalties that are not paid in full.
      (14)   Fee or utility credit revocation or adjustment. This enforcement
tool is intended to be available or used if there are, at any time, provisions
for a property water quality utility user fee funding mechanism managed by the
city. This enforcement tool permits that credits (reductions), adjustments
(increases) or other measures to modify fees or utility charges may be revoked
or added, in full or in part, if any provisions of this subchapter are
violated. The city representative will develop and periodically revise an
adjustment/credit schedule for adoption by resolution of the City Council.
      (15)   Civil actions. In addition to any other remedies provided in this
subchapter, any violation of this subchapter may be enforced by civil action
brought by the city’s attorney. Monies recovered under this section shall be

wildlife, fish and aquatic life.
      (16)   Emergency orders and abatements. The enforcement official may
order the abatement of any discharge from any source to the water quality
conveyance system when, in the opinion of the enforcement official, the
discharge causes or threatens to cause a condition that presents an imminent
danger to the public health, safety or welfare of the environment or a
violation of a KPDES Permit. In emergency situations where the property owner
or other responsible party is unavailable and time constraints are such that
service of a notice and order to abate cannot be effected without presenting an
immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare of the environment or
a violation of a KPDES Permit, the city may perform or cause to be performed
such work as shall be necessary to abate the threat or danger. The costs of any
such abatement shall be borne by the owner and shall be collectable in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (17)   Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the
enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted
to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this subchapter is a threat
to public health, safety, welfare and environment and is declared and deemed a
nuisance, and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief as provided
by state and local law.
      (18)   Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this subchapter are
not exclusive of any remedies available under any applicable federal, state or
local law and the city may seek cumulative remedies.

WATER QUALITY DRAINAGE SYSTEM
§ 150.125 INTENT AND APPLICATION; ESTABLISHMENT OF SYSTEM.
   Pursuant to its authority under the provisions of KRS 82.082 and 91A.510,
the city does hereby establish a Water Quality Drainage System to be acquired,
constructed, improved, operated, maintained and funded as hereinafter set out.
(Ord. 2009-2, passed 6-1-2009)
§ 150.126 PURPOSE OF SYSTEM.
   (A)   The purposes of the establishment of the system are to provide for
possession, control and use of all storm and surface water drainage facilities
in the city, to be responsible for maintenance of all storm water facilities,
improve, manage, operate and repair storm water facilities, provide for
effective management and financing of the system within the city, provide
methods for mitigating the damaging effects of uncontrolled and unplanned storm
water runoff, improve the public health, safety and welfare by providing for
the safe and efficient capture and conveyance of storm water runoff and the
correction of storm water problems, authorize the establishment and
implementation of a master plan(s) for storm drainage including design,
coordination, construction, management, operation, maintenance, inspection and
enforcement, establish a reasonable water quality service charge based on each
property’s contribution of storm water runoff to the system and to encourage
and facilitate urban water resources management techniques including detention
of storm water runoff, minimization of the need to construct storm sewers and
the enhancement of the environment.
   (B)   In order to accomplish such purposes, a water quality service charge
shall be made on all real property within the city. The primary consideration
in setting the service charge shall be each property’s contribution to runoff.
   (C)   The water quality service charge shall be fair and reasonable and bear
a substantial relationship to the costs connected with the system. Rate studies
shall be conducted periodically.
   (D)   Service charges for residential properties of two or fewer dwelling
units shall reflect the relatively uniform effect that residential development
has on runoff. Large residential lots, parcels or tracts generally have a lower
overall intensity of development than small residential lots because a lesser
percentage of larger lots, parcels or tracts are covered with hard surfaced
area. The effect of large residential properties on runoff is lowered by less
imperviousness.
   (E)   Multi-family residential properties and land uses other than
residential shall pay according to the amount of runoff as computed by
multiplying the number of ERU’s times a charge per ERU.
   (F)   An appeal and service charge adjustment process shall be created to
review water quality service charges when unusual circumstances exist which
alter runoff characteristics or when either service or benefit varies from
normal conditions or when computation of ERU is disputed.
(Ord. 2009-2, passed 6-1-2009)
§ 150.127 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL IMPERVIOUS AREA. The average square footage of
impervious area on one- and two-family residential properties in the city as
determined by sampling the one- and two-family residential properties.
   CITY. The City of Pewee Valley, Kentucky.
   DEVELOPED. The condition of real property altered from its natural state by
the addition to or construction on the property of impervious ground cover or
other man-made physical improvements such that the hydrology of the property or
a portion thereof is affected.
   DEVELOPER. A person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity that

   (B)   Demonstration of need for user fee.
      (1)   There is a growing nationwide concern regarding preservation of
waters of the United States, the related management of stormwater and the
associated cost of doing so. These concerns have prompted many communities to
seek dedicated funding mechanisms for the high cost of improving storm drainage
systems, managing flooding issues and controlling stormwater pollution. By
recognizing that storm drainage systems are infrastructure that requires
ongoing management, a water quality utility can provide a source of funding for
that purpose.
      (2)   Currently, the city is responding to public concerns and regulatory
demands to address an increasing level of water quality management needs.
      (3)   Public concerns and regulatory demands for increased water quality
management services can be separated into two major categories: stormwater
quantity (flooding and property protection) and stormwater quality (health and
pollution management). The city is implementing activities to comply with the
unfunded federal/state mandated National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer (MS4) Phase II “Stormwater Quality”
Permit Program. This program, which started November 4, 2003, includes
activities that the city must perform over a five-year permit term. It is
expected that the permit will be indefinitely renewed and modified in five-year
periods, and the increased cost to be borne by the city for this new long-term
program is a primary driver in developing new revenue.
      (4)   As these issues continue to intensify, there is an increased need
to generate revenue to support the identified (and yet to be identified)
unresolved water quantity and quality problems. The program mission statement
shall be as follows: The city will implement a cost-effective water quality
management program to address citizen expectations and regulatory demands for
drainage system maintenance and flood control, to benefit the quality of local
water resources, and to comply with environmental regulations.
   (C)   State enabling authority. Pursuant to state law, the city will
establish a Water Quality Drainage System Ordinance that will include user fees
for stormwater management activities.
   (D)   Organization structure. Through its Mayor-Council form of government,
the city will support and administer a water quality management utility. The
following entities will be responsible for the associated activities.
      (1)   City.
         (a)   Review of proposed construction plans and zoning changes that
impact stormwater quality, including construction site pollution and post-
construction/long-term water quality management;
         (b)   Oversight of inspection of private construction referred in

      (2)   Highway Department.
         (a)   The KYTC is a co-permittee;
         (b)   Maintenance of the drainage and flood control system on a level
that can be achieved with accessible equipment and man-power;
         (c)   Street sweeping, catch basin cleaning, ditch and drainage

      (3)   Oldham County PVA.
         (a)   Coordinate the tracking of new properties, as needed to account
for new impervious area and related billing system issues, with the city; and
         (b)   Coordinate with the necessary entities to maintain data
associated with stormwater user fee billing including hard copy, database and
GIS data.
   (E)   Level and cost of service. The city’s overall goal is to implement a
user fee that is fair, equitable and legally defensible. A principal aspect of
achieving this goal is to ensure that the revenues generated are less than or
equal to the cost of service required to implement the selected and/or desired
level of service. In essence, the city can collect up to, but no more than, the
amount needed to perform the activities associated with stormwater quantity and
water quality management. The city understands that for the water quality
management utility user fee to be successful in the long-term, efforts must be
made to clearly and frequently communicate the level of service. This is
necessary from initial user fee development, through long-term implementation,
to ensure public, elected official and town staff expectations are balanced and
consistent.
      (1)   The water quality management user fee will provide fiscal support
(in part or in total) to:
         (a)   KPDES MS4 ‘Phase II’ Permit. The activities as presented in the
Stormwater Quality Management Plan (SWQMP) Stormwater Permit. This includes
programmatic activities, education, outreach, illicit discharge identification
and elimination, construction site management, post-construction management,
municipal good housekeeping and other related activities.
         (b)   System and facilities maintenance. The repair and replacement,
rehabilitation and otherwise general response maintenance of the stormwater
conveyance and/or treatment systems within the public right-of-way.
         (c)   Capital Improvement Projects (CIP). The construction of
facilities, conveyance or treatment systems within a public right-of-way or
easement.
         (d)   Revitalization. The preventative maintenance activities
associated with drainage infrastructure improvements needed to achieve a
desired average life cycle.
         (e)   Elected official, stakeholder and general public education. The
activities needed to communicate progress and key issues to manage/maintain
service expectations and make certain that demands for service do not exceed
the available resources.
         (f)   Billing system administration and expenses. The costs incurred
by the administration, production and mailing of the bill/invoice for water
quality management fees.
      (2)   It is anticipated that the user fee will not provide fiscal support
to:
         (a)   Work in easements unless it is the judgment of the city that the
improvement will directly benefit or protect the system in the adjacent public
right-of-way;
         (b)   Stormwater system improvements outside of the public right-of-
way unless it is the judgment of the city that the improvement will directly
benefit or protect the system in the adjacent public right-of-way;
         (c)   Mowing or other maintenance activities of systems not within a
public right-of-way; and
         (d)   Mowing or other maintenance activities of public drainage beyond
that of a frequency and extent proportionately given to similar portions of the
city’s system.
      (3)   The revenue generated by stormwater management user fees can only
be used to support stormwater management activities. The General Fund may be
used to augment water quality management user fee revenue, but the water
quality management user fee shall not be used to augment the city’s General
Fund, nor any other activities that are unrelated to water quality management.
   (F)   Utility user fee; rate.
      (1)   Initial rate. An impervious area based user fee rate of $3 per
equivalent residential unit (ERU) per month will become effective July 1, 2009.
This rate is estimated to generate revenue that is not greater than the LOS/COS
defined in division (E) above.
      (2)   Increases in rate. The city recognizes that the user fee rate may,
in time, need to be raised to account for a number of factors including:
         (a)   Increases in services for gradually building a new program/
service;
         (b)   Increases in costs due to inflation;
         (c)   Increases in costs due to inflation effects on labor, equipment
and supplies;
         (d)   Expanded service area;
         (e)   Increases in citizens’ expectations for services;
         (f)   Expanded services mandated by state and/or federal regulations;
and
         (g)   At the discretion of the city, the user fee rate may be
increased to provide funding for issues presented above. The increase may only
be submitted for City Council approval provided that it can be demonstrated
that the new revenue to be generated is not more than the services provided.
      (3)   Fund balance and debt.
         (a)   The revenue generated by the user fee is to be managed in a way
to minimize reliance on debt products such as bonds and loans. The revenue is
to be kept on-hand until it grows to sufficient levels to support program
services. This will necessitate that some fiscal years will have more revenue
than expenditures to account for anticipated liabilities/expenses that are
beyond the fiscal year. However, the revenue reserves will be managed as not to
accumulate monies for expenses/liabilities that are more than 15 years away.
The revenue from this program will be managed with a net positive or null
balance unless the negative balance is offset by debt products or subsidies
from the General Fund made at the discretion of the city.
         (b)   Infrequent large/expensive projects benefitting many property
owners supported by debt products may be utilized with the city’s discretion.
The goal is to keep debt service payments to a small percentage and sustainable
of the total revenue collected annually.
   (G)   Utility user fee billing mechanism.
      (1)   The city will coordinate administration of the stormwater utility
user fee billing. Water quality management user fees will be paid first as the
last service/enterprise fund in the case of partial payments by the user. This
provides that in the event that a partial or no payment is made by the user
then the city has the authority to apply enforcement measures already
prescribed by higher listed services.
      (2)   Data used to support the billing system will be maintained by the
city in coordination with outside contractors.
   (H)   Utility user fee rate structure.
      (1)   Eligible properties.
         (a)   All properties that are expected to participate in other
existing utilities (drinking water and wastewater) are expected to participate
to an equitable level in the water quality management utility user fee. This
includes:
            1.   Privately owned property (including residential, commercial
and industrial);
            2.   Local state and federal governmental facilities;
            3.   Institutional properties (including not for profit entities
such as churches, schools and the like); and
            4.   Publicly owned properties (except for roadways as noted in
division (H)(10) below).
         (b)   Vacant properties that are provided exemption under other
statutes/regulations/ordinances shall not be applied for an exemption of water
quality user fees. As every property owner impacts water quality in some
manner, there are no total exemptions for the user fee. However, public
roadways and rights-of-way are not classified as eligible user fee properties
as described in division (H)(8) below.
      (2)   Rate structure approach.
         (a)   The city is utilizing an impervious area rate structure to serve
as the basis for the user fee. The intent is to mimic the equitability found in
other utilities. For example, the fee for drinking water is calculated by
estimating the cost of treating and conveying the amount of drinking water
measured by a meter. Nationally, the most accepted equivalent measure for
stormwater runoff is estimation and calculation of impervious area, which
correlates to the relative stormwater impact from the property. It is not
intended to measure the specific amount of stormwater runoff that drains off of
a piece of property, but, it provides a quantifiable measure to compare the
wide variety of property types and sizes. In essence, properties with more
impervious area (resulting in more stormwater runoff than other properties)
will pay a higher user fee. While all properties pay at the same rate, their
user fee varies depending on how many “impervious area units” (explained in
more detail in division (H)(3) below) the property has.
         (b)   In example, a residential property will have one impervious area
unit and will pay a flat rate (times one). In contrast, a commercial property
with a large parking lot and building totaling five times more impervious area
(thus having five impervious area units) will pay five times that of the
residential property.
         (c)   An Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) is a calculation/average
from a statistical sampling of all single-family residence (SFR) properties.
The impervious area (rooftops, driveways and the like) is measured for each of
the sample properties using digital orthogonally rectified aerial photography.
ERU’s have been calculated throughout the country, ranging from 1,500 to 4,000
square feet, with many ERU calculations at or around 2,500 square feet. The
city has decided to adopt an ERU based on a statistical sampling of residential
properties in the city of 6,700 square feet, consistent with similar area
utilities.
         (d)   The ERU may be changed at any time the City Council suspects
that new development trends have substantively altered the average or the user
fee rate structure is to be altered in such a way to necessitate change. Any
change in ERU will be based on impervious area calculations of a new
statistical sampling of residential properties in the city, or on a national
average ERU.
      (3)   Property classification.
         (a)   Each residential property shall be assumed to have a single
impervious area unit. That unit shall be referred to as the ERU (as defined in
division (H)(2) above) and shall include land use codes indicated as
residential in the table below. Vacant properties, as indicated in the table
below, shall not be assessed. All other eligible properties that are indicated
as non-residential properties in the table below will be individually assessed
a billing unit based on a measured estimate of impervious area.

Vacant
 
         (b)   The impervious area calculation shall include area estimates
for:
            1.   Rooftops of houses and permanent or semi-permanent buildings;
            2.   Asphalt, concrete and stone;
            3.   Sidewalks and paths;
            4.   Driveways;
            5.   Parking lots;
            6.   Recreational areas such as tennis courts, basketball courts
and the like;
            7.   Motor homes and trailers;
            8.   Permanent and/or semi-permanent covers such as greenhouses;
and
            9.   Areas that appear to have been compacted or modified to
prevent infiltration to the level of the surrounding area as determined by the
city.
         (c)   The impervious area units for non-residential/SFR properties
will not be assessed by an average as explained for residential properties
above. The impervious area and billing units for non-SFR properties will be
individually calculated using digital orthogonally rectified aerial
photography. The ERU will be applied as a factor to the individually calculated
impervious areas of non-SFR properties to determine the user fee. The
individually calculated factor will indicate the number of times more
impervious area that a non-SFR property has. This will be used to calculate the
corresponding fee.
         (d)   For example, if a non-SFR property (corner drug store) has an
impervious area that is four times larger than the ERU/average SFR, then it
will pay a user fee that is four times higher than the residential properties.
The number of ERUs for a non-SFR property will be rounded to the nearest whole
number.
         (e)   In the case of institutional or local, state or federal
government properties that are used for residential purposes, the property will
be billed as residential (one ERU) if the property otherwise meets the criteria
for an SFR (i.e., up to two-family dwellings). Otherwise, the property will be
billed as non-SFR and will be individually assessed based on ERU.
         (f)   The city will determine the impervious area for existing
developments as of January 1, 2009. The city is responsible for determining the
impervious area of new development. After this point; the impervious area will
be determined by as-built plans that have been submitted and approved by the
Planning Commission.
      (4)   Off-site owner properties. For parcels that are utilized as rental
or lease tenant property, the billing will be sent to the property owner’s
address rather than the property address, as provided/determined/maintained by
the county PVA office. However, the city has the discretion, but not the
requirement, as determined appropriate by the county PVA, to send the bill to
the property address for residential property.
      (5)   Property transfers. In the event that a property title is
transferred during the course of a billing year, the buyer and seller will each
pay a prorated stormwater fee based on the recorded date of transfer.
      (6)   Contiguous parcels. Through the long-term history of development
and redevelopment in the city, multiple contiguous parcels have been
consolidated through use, but not through county PVA and other land management
policies. Stormwater user fee charges for multiple parcels may be consolidated
into a single stormwater user fee account provided that the following criteria
are met:
         (a)   The parcels are contiguous - as verified by the city;
         (b)   The parcels have the same specific land use;
         (c)   The parcels have the same owner who is also the user fee charge
recipient; and
         (d)   The owner has completed the certification form in Appendix A.
      (7)   Multiple user/tenant properties. Non-SFR properties that are
utilized by two or more companies, persons or other entities shall be billed to
a single property owner/designated operator regardless of how many sub-parcels
or other utility segregating mechanisms such as water meters it contains. A
single property that has multiple tenants or other segregations may not be
given multiple bills unless the property has been subdivided and each parcel
has a separate owner(s).
      (8)   Condominium properties.
         (a)   Single-level residential condominium properties shall be billed
as non-SFR. However, if requested in writing using the form in Appendix B, the
city may at its discretion apply all charges to a single common property
manager/owner. Multi-level residential condominium properties shall be billed
as non-SFR.
         (b)   Common areas including, but not limited to, pools, outbuildings,
recreation courts and other related impervious area will be charged to the
condominium association operating the properties. If such an association does
not exist, then the individual properties will be evenly assessed the
additional impervious area.
      (9)   Mobile home parks. Mobile home parks will be categorized as non-SFR
properties and billing sent to the property owner. The billing units/ERUs will
be calculated based on the currently available digital orthogonally rectified
aerial photography. If in the city’s opinion, the property has expanded or is
being utilized to a significantly higher level as to require a reassessment,
then the ERUs to be assigned to the property may be estimated by using one of
the following techniques:
         (a)   Field survey;
         (b)   Use of updated digital orthogonally rectified aerial
photography; and
         (c)   Use of the “old” digital orthogonally rectified aerial
photography supplemented by a hand count of occupied trailer lots and the size
of the type of trailer units as estimates from the “old” digital orthogonally
rectified aerial photography.
      (10)   Public roadways and rights-of-way. Public roadways and rights-of-
way collect and convey a significant portion of stormwater runoff, as well as
provide a substantive element of the conveyance system. In this capacity and as
commonly assumed in other water quality management user fees across the
country, these areas will not be assessed a stormwater user fee.
      (11)   Private roadways and rights-of-way. Private roadways and rights-
of-way are a substantive element of the conveyance system. In this capacity and
as commonly assumed in other water quality management user fees across the
country, these areas will not be assessed a water quality user fee.
      (12)   Assumption of partial stormwater bills. On certain parcels of
property, impervious areas were built on the parcel for the exclusive use of
another entity. Examples are pump stations, transmission towers, electrical
substations that may be built on utility easements and private roads that cross
property lines. The entity who built the structure may accept responsibility
for the part of the water quality bill that applies to the structure. An
agreement must be made whereby the entity who built the structure/road agrees
to pay the water quality bill for the impervious area even though it is on the
parcel owner’s property using the form found in Appendix C.
      (13)   Vacant properties. For stormwater, a VACANT PROPERTY is defined as
a property without impervious area. A vacant property will normally not get a
water quality bill. The exception to this case is when contiguous parcels
(division (H)(6) above) include both residential and residential vacant
parcels. In this case the water quality bill may be sent to either the
residential or residential vacant parcel but not to both.
      (14)   Agricultural properties. For this document, AGRICULTURAL
PROPERTIES will be defined as a property that classified as agricultural by the
county PVA. Agricultural properties will be assessed in the same manner as non-
SFR properties.
      (15)   Properties under construction. The water quality fee for
properties under construction will be billed to the owner of record as of
January 1 of the billing year. The builder or developer is responsible for
stormwater charges until such time as the property is sold or transferred, at
which point the buyer and seller will be responsible for prorated charges based
on the date of transfer.
      (16)   Annexation. In the event that a property is annexed into an
incorporated portion of the city during the billing year, the property will be
charged a prorated stormwater fee for the year based on the date of annexation.
      (17)   Initial billing errors. During the water quality billing system
development process, errors will be made and not discovered until after billing
begins. Depending on the type of error that was made, adjustments will need to
be made to a customer’s water quality bill. In the case of a billing error, the
property owner shall have the option to pay the current bill and to have the
corrected water quality charges and any adjustment appear on the next water
quality bill. The threshold for retroactive billing adjustments is six months.
      (18)   Appeals and accountability process.
         (a)   Any non-SFR property may appeal the number of billing units/ERUs
assessed. Any expense necessary for development of data or other materials
shall be borne by the appealing entity/property owner and not borne by the
city. The appeal will be accepted and evaluated by the city. The appeal must
contain the impervious square footage as estimated by one of the following
ways:
            1.   Field survey utilizing total station or GPS data certified by
a land surveyor licensed in the Commonwealth of Kentucky;
            2.   Other survey using digital orthogonally rectified aerial
photography utilized by a land surveyor licensed in the Commonwealth of
Kentucky; and
            3.   As-built plans certified by a land surveyor licensed in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky to be representatively accurate of all “new”
construction and a whole and accurate representation of all “previously
constructed” impervious area on the property.
         (b)   Construction design plans are not acceptable for this
estimation.
         (c)   In the event that the appeal is accepted by the city as
demonstrating a more accurate estimate, albeit of greater or lesser impervious
area, then it will be applied to future billing. If a credit to the property
owner is due, credit will be applied for the difference in the user fee for the
lesser of:
            1.   One-hundred eighty days;
            2.   One billing cycle; and
            3.   The date of property ownership transfer.
         (d)   In the event that the appeal is denied by the city to be a less
accurate estimate, then the property owner has the option to take the matter
before the city for final acceptance or denial. The property owner and the land
surveyor licensed in the Commonwealth of Kentucky who certified the
calculations shall appear before the city to argue for final appeal. The
decision of the city will be final and not to be reconsidered until a time the
property owner can submit other suitable data.

REGULATIONS ADOPTED
§ 151.01 REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY REFERENCE.
   The city adopts in its entirety, as if set forth in full herein, the Oldham
County Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, as recorded in the Oldham County Clerk’s
office.
(Ord. 2007-1, passed 4-2-2007)
AMENDMENTS TO ADOPTED REGULATIONS
§ 151.10 DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR THE SCENIC CORRIDOR.
   The following design guidelines shall be added to the Oldham County
Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, Section 350-200; as applicable to the Scenic
Corridor described therein as KY 146 and KY 22, within the city limits.
   (A)   Applicability. The following design guidelines shall apply to all
property adjacent to KY 146 and KY 22, which lies within 150 feet from either
side of the centerline of each roadway, within the city.
   (B)   Architecture guidelines.
      (1)   Respect and enhance the existing mix of historic design styles and
encourage both restoration and adaptive re-use to maintain the character of the
Pewee Valley Area;
      (2)   Consider the incorporation of elements of nearby historic buildings
in new construction, if appropriate;
      (3)   Large featureless buildings should be discouraged;
      (4)   Promote careful building materials selection that complement and
enhance the rural character of the Pewee Valley Area;
      (5)   Building color scheme of balanced, complementary colors should be
emphasized where appropriate;
      (6)   New residential developments are encouraged to have buildings
facing the street;
      (7)   Emphasize fences to be compatible with the Pewee Valley rural
character such as “diamond” style fencing along the scenic corridors;
      (8)   Use native stone and brick walls and columns rather than
manufactured stone walls and columns for signature entrances and walls;
      (9)   Use weathering steel guardrails with wooden posts as the design
standard where guardrails are required or replaced in the Pewee Valley Area;
      (10)   Low-profile signature entrances along the scenic corridors should
complement the rural character of the corridor; lighting should be directed
toward the sign;
      (11)   For new developments, consider the use of incentives, to include
density bonuses, to provide landscape buffers and/or screening exceeding
existing county requirements, along scenic corridors;
      (12)   Parking lots should be screened by a landscape buffer or other
natural features from view along the scenic corridors;
      (13)   All new buildings should have pre-dominant facades facing the
corridor;
      (14)   Provide a sense of enclosure along the building front to form
street walls where appropriate through design elements including, but not
limited to, street trees, site features such as lampposts and benches. Parking
areas should be located in the rear;
      (15)   Buildings and sites should be designed to emphasize pedestrian
scale architecture and landscaping, while avoiding large expanses of paved
areas, large featureless buildings and monotonous or franchise-style
architecture;
      (16)   Circulation systems should be designed to efficiently facilitate
traffic flow yet discourage speeds and volumes that impede pedestrian activity
and safety such as a grid pattern with short block lengths;
      (17)   Common or shared access points are encouraged. To the maximum
extent feasible, common or shared delivery and service access should be
provided between adjacent parcels or buildings and to the rear of buildings.
Future access easements may be required;
      (18)   A coordinated pedestrian system should be provided throughout the
Mix-Use Village Centers, including connections between uses on the site and
between the site and adjacent properties and rights-of-way;
      (19)   Continuous sidewalks or other pedestrian facilities should be
provided between the primary entrances to buildings, all parking areas that
serve the buildings, pedestrian facilities on adjacent properties that extend
to the boundaries shared with the development, any public sidewalks along
perimeter streets or other community amenities or gathering spaces;
      (20)   Adequate parking should be provided, but excessive parking is
discouraged;
      (21)   The visual impact of parking should be minimized through the use
of interior landscaped islands and through dividing parking spaces into
groupings. The edge of parking lots should be screened through landscaping or
other methods, such as decorative fences;
      (22)   The design of streets, pedestrian ways, landscaping, lighting,
signage, lighting and street furniture should be coordinated and integrated
throughout the site;
      (23)   Vehicular streets and driveways should be designed to be
compatible with pedestrian ways to encourage a pedestrian-friendly environment.
The width of streets should be sensitive to pedestrian scale and building
height;
      (24)   Service areas and mechanical equipment should be screened from
public view;
      (25)   Buildings should be designed to respect and enhance the existing
mix of historic design styles;
      (26)   All sides of a building open to view by the public should display
a similar level of architecture quality and should be subdivided and
proportioned using features such as arcades, awnings, entrances, windows or
other such features;
      (27)   Building facades should have highly visible customer-service
entrances that feature arcades, arches, canopies, display window, distinctive
roof forms, landscaped features or overhangs. Primary entrances should face
streets on which they are located;
      (28)   Buildings should have well-defined rooflines with attention to
architectural detail;
      (29)   Building materials that complement and enhance the rural character
of Pewee Valley should be promoted. For the Pewee Valley Area, exterior
building materials should consist primarily of wood, brick and stone and should
incorporate design features of traditional village character such as paned
windows;
      (30)   Building height should reflect small village scale; and
      (31)   All lighting must conform to the city lighting ordinance (as may
be amended from time to time).
   (C)   Sign guidelines.
      (1)   Design unique Pewee Valley signs that identify the entries to Pewee
Valley.
      (2)   Design signs to identify the stream or creek and its watershed at
every bridge within the Pewee Valley Area.
      (3)   All signage should be integrated with building facade or supporting
structures.
      (4)   Signs attached to buildings are encouraged rather than free-
standing signs.
      (5)   Monument signs are preferred over post-mounted signs to avoid a
temporary and fragile appearance.
      (6)   Landscaping should be planted around the base of free-standing
signs.
      (7)   For multi-tenant buildings, all signage on the facade should be
consistent in color, size and elevation.
      (8)   Back lighting only. No electronic reader signs.
      (9)   All signage must conform to the Pewee Valley sign ordinance (as may
be amended from time to time).
   (D)   Landscaping guidelines.
      (1)   Perimeter landscaping that incorporate buffer-like improvements,
such as berms and dense plantings are encouraged.
      (2)   Parking lots that contain sufficient landscaping to visually soften
views of buildings and parked automobiles are encouraged.
      (3)   Open-space areas that incorporate dense or mature vegetation are
encouraged.
      (4)   Preserve existing trees and under story rather than new plantings
and mounding as the preferred means of buffering.
      (5)   Encourage the planting of three new trees at three inches in
caliper for each existing tree at eight inches in caliper which is removed
within the landscape buffer area.
      (6)   Plant random clusters of trees and other planting materials.
      (7)   Generally avoid a manicured or controlled appearance. Limit formal
landscaping to small/tight areas.
      (8)   Incorporate ground cover and/or bushes into landscaping.
      (9)   Emphasize naturalized berms (with plantings throughout the entire
contour of the berm).
      (10)   Provide a complementary mix of deciduous and evergreen material,
clustering varieties of species and sizes (canopies interspersed with under
stories, bushes and ground cover) and emphasize hardy native species.
      (11)   Where additional screening is desired or required to buffer
different land uses or to protect the scenic nature of an area, a predominance
of evergreens may be required.
   (E)   Environmental guidelines.
      (1)   Encourage use of green-space and limit impervious surface through
innovative materials such as pervious asphalt and concrete and other “green”
type of parking lot materials.
      (2)   Promote water quality through innovative use of “green” technology,
such as diverting rainwater through rain gardens (where possible), filtering
drainage through plant material prior to entering the drainage systems.
      (3)   Where practical, use of innovative design for drainage retention
through the use of “bio-swale” and “bio-retention basins” rather than
traditional drainage structures.
      (4)   Evaluating the effectiveness (in terms of water quality) of any
septic systems in place on the site and where applicable, upgrading those
systems to better protect water quality.
(Ord. 2009-4, passed 4-6-2009)
OVERLAY DISTRICTS ESTABLISHMENT; ADMINISTRATION
§ 151.20 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Preservation. The city has well-established residential and business
districts, and these areas show the unique and significant development of the
city. It is the finding of the City Council that the distinctive and
significant character of these areas can only be maintained by protecting and
enhancing their architectural and cultural heritage by creating overlay
district regulations for design standards and development within those areas so
designated.
   (B)   Goals. The purpose of this chapter is to affect the goals as set forth
in the above declarations of public policy and specifically, but not
exclusively to:
      (1)   Accomplish the preservation, protection, and appropriate design
within the overlay districts having a special character or architectural or
cultural interest and value to this city;
      (2)   Stabilize and improve property values in such districts and the
whole city;
      (3)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable accomplishments of the
past;
      (4)   Strengthen the economy of the city;
      (5)   Protect and enhance the city’s attractions to residents, tourists
and visitors and serve as a support and stimulus to business; and
      (6)   Enhance the visual and aesthetic character, diversity, and interest
of the city.
(Ord. 7, Series 2022, passed 11-2-2022)

   Specific powers. The Commission shall take necessary and appropriate action
to accomplish the purpose of this chapter. These actions may include the
following:
   (A)   Establishing overlay districts. No overlay district may be established
within the city unless the following conditions have been met:
      (1)   The establishment of any overlay district shall begin with the
Commission’s recommendation and finding of fact to the City Council.
      (2)   The recommendation of the Commission shall include a listing of all
the individual parcels in the area to be included in the area proposed, a
recommendation of the design guidelines and regulations to be imposed upon the
area to be protected and findings detailing the reasons why the Commission
believes a certain area should be protected, based upon the following criteria:
         (a)   The value of the site as a reminder of the cultural or
archeological heritage of the location as a site of significant local, state,
or national event, or identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the city;
         (b)   The quality of the site’s architecture and architectural style
is valuable for the study of a period, method of construction, or use of
indigenous materials;
         (c)   The character of the site is an established and geographically
definable neighborhood, united by culture, continuity of sites, architectural
style or physical plan and development; and
         (d)   The desire of the city to the extent possible, preserve the
extensive green space and tree canopy that has characterized the development of
the city area and has contributed to the city’s designation as a Tree City USA
for many years.
      (3)   The City Council shall act upon the recommendation of the
Commission by either accepting the recommendation, denying the recommendation,
or accepting the recommendation with modifications. Such action shall be
memorialized in an ordinance which meets the requirements of KRS 82.650 to
82.670. Prior to the second reading of said ordinance, the city will hold the
public hearing required by KRS 82.650 to 82.670 and shall send a copy of the
draft ordinance to the Oldham County Planning Commission.
      (4)   At the conclusion of the required public hearing the city shall
determine whether to impose the overlay district by deciding whether to approve
the final ordinance.
      (5)   The Commission shall notify each owner in an overlay district of
the designation and shall arrange that the designation of a property as part of
an overlay district be filed by the Oldham County Clerk in the land records by
owner’s name and tax district lot and block number. The Commission shall also
give notice of the designation to the Oldham County Planning Commission.
   (B)   Administering overlay districts. The Pewee Valley Overlay District
Commission is hereby delegated the authority and responsibility for the
administration of any designated overlay district, in accordance with KRS
82.650 to 82.670 and the following:
      (1)   A certificate of appropriateness from the Commission shall be
required before a person may undertake the following actions affecting the
exterior of any property located within a designated overlay district:
         (a)   Construction requiring a building permit;
         (b)   Demolition requiring a demolition permit;
         (c)   Relocation or moving a structure; and
         (d)   Any project requiring a development plan approval, conditional
use permit or site disturbance permit.
      (2)   Any determination of a certificate of appropriateness shall be in
writing and shall be based upon the design guidelines and regulations that were
adopted by the city when the overlay district was established by ordinance. The
Commission shall prepare and keep on file, available for public inspection, a
written annual report of its activities, cases, decisions, qualifications of
members and other work.
      (3)   Overlay district regulations shall not conflict with the zoning
regulations for the city and shall not permit uses prohibited by the underlying
zoning regulations, nor prohibit uses allowed by the underlying zoning
regulations. Overlay district regulations shall supplement the underlying
zoning regulations by establishing additional design standards, guidelines, and
criteria for development with the overlay district to reserve, conserve, or
protect the historical, cultural, architectural, aesthetic, or other
distinctive characteristics of the overlay district.
      (4)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness; provided, the work does not require building
permit, demolition permit, moving a structure, or any project requiring a
development plan approval, conditional use permit or site disturbance permit.
      (5)   When an applicant wishes to demolish a building or structure in an
overlay district, the Commission shall negotiate with the applicant to see if
an alternative to demolition can be found. The Commission may ask interested
individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to
demolition and in obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs for the
threatened building. The Commission may decide that a building or structure may
be demolished if it does not contribute to the district or is too badly damaged
to repair. The Commission shall study the question of economic hardship for the
applicant and shall determine whether property can be put to reasonable
beneficial use without the approval of the demolition application.
      (6)   When a property is damaged by fire, a storm or other unexpected
event, the owner or tenant may receive approval from the Chairperson or Vice-
Chairperson of the Commission for work to be done in response to this
emergency. In situations requiring temporary action, an owner may do work to
protect temporarily his or her property from further damage; provided, he or
she reports this work to the Commission within ten business days.
      (7)   Any applicant denied a permit under KRS 82.650 to 82.670 shall
first have right of appeal to the City Council. The decision of the City
Council is then appealable to Oldham Circuit Court.

situation and may require an application for a certificate of appropriateness
for the work that remains to be done.
      (2)   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness
shall conform to the provisions of such certificate. It shall be the
