submit a written request for an extension of time to the Department for Local
Government on a form prescribed by the Department for Local Government. The

payments to the city, including any funds that were withheld due to the
noncompliance. This division (I) shall not be interpreted or construed to

department. Any person may prefer charges against a member of the police
department, which must be filed in the office of the Mayor, who shall thereupon
communicate said charges without delay to the City Council. Said charges must
be written, signed by the person making such charges and must set out with
clearness and distinctness each and every charge. It shall be the duty of the
Mayor and each member of the City Council, whenever probable cause appears, to
prefer charges against any member of the police department whom he or she
believes to have been guilty of any conduct justifying his removal or
punishment in the interest of public order. The charges thus filed shall be

Council, and within three days after said filing the City Council shall proceed
to hear and examine said charges; provided two days before said hearing the
member of the police department, accused, has been served a copy of said
charges, and a statement of the day, place, and hour at which and when the
hearing of said charges shall begin. The person accused may, however, in

after said charges are filed with the City Clerk. The City Council will have
the power to summon and compel the attendance of witnesses at all hearings or
sittings by said council upon subpoena issued by the City Clerk, and served
upon said witnesses by any officer authorized to serve subpoenas from any court
of justice in the county. If any witness fails to appear in response to a
summons or refuses to testify concerning any matter on which he may lawfully be
interrogated, any district court judge, on application of the commission, may
compel obedience of a subpoena issued from the district court. The member of
the police department, the accused, shall have the right to have subpoenaed, in
his behalf, any witness he may desire, upon furnishing their names to the City
Clerk, and the action and decision of the City Council on said charges shall be
reduced to writing and shall be entered in a book to be kept for that purpose
by the City Clerk of said legislative body, and the written charges filed in
this matter shall be preserved and securely attached to the book containing the
City Council's decisions.
   (B)   In cases where the Mayor or Chief have probable cause to believe that
a member of the police department has been guilty of any conduct justifying
removal or punishment, he may suspend said member from duty, or the Mayor may
suspend from both pay and duty, pending said trial, and said member shall not
be placed on duty or allowed pay thereafter until the charges are heard by the
City Council. The City Council shall fix punishment against a member of the
police department found guilty of any charge by reprimand or suspension for any
length of time in their judgment, not to exceed six months, or by reducing the
rank, if the accused be Chief or other officer, or by combining any two or more
of said punishments, or by removal or dismissal from the service of any such
member of the police department. No member of the police department shall be
reprimanded, removed, suspended, or dismissed from the department until written
charges have been made, or preferred against him, and a trial had as herein
provided.

   (A)   Each burial site on which an authorized above-ground monument has been

"designated landscape area" for placement of appropriate decorations and
mementos.
   (B)   The "designated landscape area" shall extend out into the lot from the

   (D)   No object or item of any nature shall be allowed within a "designated
landscape area" that is considered to be offensive to the general public; that

of visitors or detracts from the dignity and general character of the cemetery.
Such inappropriate items will be immediately removed by the sexton or the
designee of the sexton without additional notice other than that provided by
this section. All items so removed will be stored by the sexton for thirty (30)
days, and if not retrieved by the cemetery patron within that time, will be

to a height greater than the height of the monument, or three (3) feet,
whichever is less, are prohibited.

Shepherd's Hook being utilized for an unauthorized purpose, or that is un-used,
or that has become rusty, unsightly, or has fallen in to disrepair shall be
immediately removed by the cemetery patron and may be removed by the sexton or
the designee of the sexton.
         (b)   Two (2) Shepherd's Hooks are allowed in circumstances where an

§ 35.13 MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   On-going maintenance of monuments is the sole responsibility of the
owner. The city reserves the right to remove any monument which because of its

general character of the cemetery.
   (B)   All maintenance of the cemetery, including but not limited to mowing,
trimming and removal of living plant material, shall be performed solely by the
sexton or others at his or her direction, except within a "designated landscape
area" as described herein. Maintenance within a "designated landscape area"
shall be the sole responsibility of the cemetery patron.
   (C)   No living plant material, outside the boundaries of a "designated
landscape area" as described in §
35.12.01, shall be planted, replanted or replaced on any lot.
   (D)   Except as authorized in division (D) below, personal items may not be
left on any burial site that does not have a "designated landscape area". Any
items may not be left on lots sold after the effective date of this section and
items left contrary to this provision shall be removed by the sexton and kept
for thirty (30) days after which time they will be disposed of by the sexton.
   (E)   Artificial flowers, wreaths and decorations may be placed on the
ground at any grave site during the Christmas, Easter, Memorial Day, Mother's
Day and Father's Day holidays. Such items shall be removed within one (1) week
following the holiday by the cemetery patron and if not removed by the patron,
will be removed by cemetery employees. Such items may also be placed at the
location of any new internment for a period of thirty (30) days.
   (F)   No flower or decoration of any kind may be placed, hung, glued, taped,
wired, secured or affixed to the door of any columbarium niche, the top or any
other part of the columbarium at any time. Live flowers and wreaths may be
placed near the columbarium during funeral services and shall be removed
immediately following the conclusion of such services.
   (G)   It is the policy of the Lawrenceburg Cemetery that the display of the
flag of the United States of America is both appropriate and desirable. To
insure that the United States flag is treated with all due respect, the
following specific rules shall apply to its display in the Lawrenceburg
Cemetery.
      (1)   Burial sites may be decorated with one (1) United States flag for a
period of one (1) week preceding a federal or national holiday and such flag
shall be removed within one (1) week immediately following such holiday.
      (2)   If unfurled, no flag shall be placed on a burial site in any manner
which would prevent it from waving freely or in a manner which cause the flag
to rest on any other object.
      (3)   No United States flag may be placed in the Lawrenceburg Cemetery in
any manner which would violate state or federal law or otherwise detract for
the dignity of the flag itself and the cemetery as a whole.
      (4)   It is the intent of this section to allow the dignified display of
the flag of the United States. It is further intended that flags so displayed
will be generally of a smaller nature and that they are not intended to be a
permanent fixture. The sexton or his designee retains the right to remove any
flag, flag staff or pole, or other such accurtrament that violates the intent
of this chapter.
      (5)   Any flag removed from a burial site by cemetery personnel shall be
disposed of in accordance with all applicable state and federal law and
regulations.
      (6)   Out of the respect and honor due our Nation's Flag, and in
recognition of the difficulty in properly lighting and maintaining a flag, no
permanent flag pole or other display of a flag is allowed on any burial site or
in any designated landscape area.
      (7)   Except as specifically authorized herein, no flag other than the
federally recognized Flag of the United States of America, or any of its
precursors, shall be flown or displayed within any portion of the cemetery
including any and all "designated landscape areas".
   (H)   In recognition of the diverse history of our nation and its citizens,
it is understood that the display of flags associated with other nations, with
the Commonwealth of Kentucky or other states, may at time be appropriate, with
strict guidelines. Cemetery patrons or citizen organizations may request
permission from the sexton or the sexton's designee, to display the flag of
another nation, the flag of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the flag of other
U.S. states or any flag associated with the former Confederate States of
America. Upon receipt of permission from the sexton or the sexton's designee, a
single flag representing any nation or state may be placed on any burial site,
subject to the regulations and restrictions set forth herein. Any flag
representing the Confederate States of America shall be restricted to display
only on the burial site of a Confederate soldier buried within the Lawrenceburg
Cemetery. The display of any flag allowed under this section shall conform in
all respects to the regulations set forth in this chapter as to size and
duration of display.
   (I)   The display of any flag which disrupts the dignity and general
character of the cemetery shall be immediately removed by the sexton or the
designee of the sexton.

   (C)   An applicant may inspect public records during the regular business
hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from the city

described public records which are available within the city. If the person
requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed, the official
custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of
mailing.

require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on

receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is given
for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the public
record will be available for inspection or duplication.

records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are

official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.

three-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific

the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.

required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the general Pretreatment
Regulations (40 CFR, Part 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters so as to cause violations of the city's KPDES permit or
the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system; and
      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contribution to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits
to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements
for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires
user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to the city and to persons outside the city
who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the City Publicly
Owned Treatment Works (POTW). Except as otherwise provided herein, the Public
Works Director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this
chapter.

passthrough of pollutants, sludge contamination or endangerment of POTW
workers), or violate any requirements of this chapter. The city may determine
that an industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards is a non-
significant categorical industrial user rather than a significant industrial
user on a finding that the industrial user never discharges more than one
hundred (100) gallons per day (gpd) of total categorical wastewater (excluding
sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater, unless
specifically included in the pretreatment standard) and the following
conditions are met:
         (a)   The industrial user, prior to the city's finding, has
consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards
and requirements;

      Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in this section has no
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for
violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may at any time,
on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an industrial
user, and in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), determine that
such user should not be considered a significant industrial user.

information required by the Public Works Director. In addition, this report
shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period
exceeded the average daily flow. At the discretion of the Public Works Director
and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, etc., the Public Works Director may agree to alter the months
during which the above reports are to be submitted. All periodic compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12 and §
51.096.
   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep it monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge. All analyses shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to
the city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures
established by the U.S. EPA Administrator pursuant to Section 304 (g) of the
Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto and 40 CFR 261 or
with any other test procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator. Sampling
shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the U.S. EPA
Administrator. Except as indicated in this section, the user must collect
wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Public Works Director. Where time-proportional
composite sampling is authorized by the Public Works Director, the samples must
be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the composting
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
Public Works Director, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
      (1)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (2)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety
(90) day compliance reports required in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of
four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the Public Works Director may authorize a lower
minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial
user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and
assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (C)   Where 40 CFR, Part 136, does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant(s) in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication,
"Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants", April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
   (D)   A Baseline Monitoring Report (BMR) must be submitted to the Public
Works Director by all categorical industrial users at least ninety (90) days
prior to initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. The BMR must contain,
at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Production Data: a process description, SIC code number, raw
materials used, chemicals used, final product, pretreatment industrial category
(if applicable), and a schematic which indicates points of discharge to the
sewer system.
      (2)   Identifying information to include name, address of facility, owner
(s), contact person and any other permits held by the facility.
      (3)   Wastewater characteristics: total plant flow, types of discharges,
average and maximum flows from each process.
      (4)   Nature/Concentration of pollutants: analytical results for all
pollutants regulated by this chapter and/or any applicable federal pretreatment
standard and sample type and location. All analyses must conform with 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto.

facility's discharge.
      (6)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative as defined in §
51.002 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in this section.
   (E)   New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in
sections (3) and (4) above, but at no time shall a new source commence
discharge(s) to the public sewer with known substances that do not meet
provisions of this chapter. All new sources must be in compliance with all
provisions of this chapter, state and federal pretreatment regulations prior to
commencement of discharge to the public sewer.
   (F)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to all compliance schedules required by this chapter.
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards.
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months.
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Public Works
Director no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule
and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule; and in no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Public Works Director.
   (G)   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and
documentation associated with Best Management Practices as may be required.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for
a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall automatically be
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city or
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention by the
Public Works Director.

§ 51.110 APPLICATIONS AND ACCOUNTS FOR SEWER CHARGES.
   (A)   Whenever it is determined by the city to be necessary to classify any
commercial institutions or industries by reason of the unusual purpose for
which water is used, or the character of the sewage, water or other liquid
wastes discharged therefrom, or whenever the established schedules of sewer
service rates and charges for any reason are not applicable, then special sewer
service rates, rentals, or other charges may be established by the city's
governing body, and any person, firm, or corporation being unsatisfied with the
established schedule of sewer service rates, rentals, or other charges by
reason of peculiar or unusual use of occupancy of any premises, and
consequently alleging peculiar or unusual uses of water, may file application
with the city for special sewer service classification rates, rentals, and
charges. The governing body may take such action thereon as it sees fit.
   (B)   In computing the sewer service charge, there shall be excluded from
the gross water bill any portions thereof representing charges for standby
service for sprinkler systems, and for private fire hydrants.
   (C)   Sewer service charges shall not apply to bills representing surplus
water furnished at wholesale to other municipalities, communities, or water
systems; but if any municipality, community, or other entity shall desire to
make arrangements for disposal of all or a part of its flow able sewage wastes
through sewer lines or facilities of the city, same shall be only upon the
basis of special contract specifically approved and authorized in each instance
by ordinance or resolution duly adopted by the city's governing body. The city
recognizes no obligation or duty or any sort to enter into any such contract or
arrangement, and may entertain or refuse to entertain any such proposal as it
sees fit, and regardless of the fact that it may in the past have seen fit or
may in the future see fit, to act otherwise or upon different terms in any
other similar or dissimilar cases.
   (D)   In the matter of the furnishing of sewer service upon a temporary
basis to circuses, carnivals, tent meetings, outdoor athletic events (other
than those carried on by the public school system) and other miscellaneous
temporary uses, a flat rate may be fixed in each individual case and the
service charge shall be paid in advance.
   (E)   The City of Lawrenceburg shall maintain financial records accurately
to account for revenues generated by the treatment system and expenditures for
operation and maintenance of the system, including normal replacement costs.
   (F)   The Board of Council shall review not less often than annually the
wastewater contribution of users, the total cost of OM&R of the wastewater
works, debt service obligations, and user charge rates. Based on such review,
the Board of Council will review, revise, when necessary, the schedule of user
charge rates to accomplish the following:
      (1)   Maintain an equitable distribution of OM&R costs among users of the
treatment system; and
      (2)   Generate sufficient revenues to offset costs associated with the
proper operation and maintenance of the wastewater system and to meet debt
service requirements.
      (3)   Excessive strength and toxicity surcharges shall be reviewed at the
time of and in conjunction with the review of user charges. Surcharge rates
shall be revised where necessary to reflect current treatment and monitoring
costs.
      (4)   Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with
a regular bill of the rate and that portion of the total charge which is
attributable to OM&R of the wastewater system.
   (G)   All users shall be billed monthly. Billings for any particular month
shall be made within fifteen days after the end of the month. Any payment not
received within thirty days after the end of the month shall be considered
delinquent.
   (H)   A late payment penalty of ten percent of the user charge bill will be
added to each delinquent bill for each thirty (30) days or portions thereof of
delinquency. When any bill is more than sixty (60) days in default, water and/
or wastewater service to such premise shall be disconnected until such bill is
paid.

of metered users, and quarterly in the case of flat rate users, and the water
bill and sewer bill shall be rendered at the same time and on the same bill
forms, but as separate charges, and all bills for such service shall be due and
payable when rendered. If not paid by the fifteenth (15) of the month following
the date rendered, the bill shall be delinquent, and a delay penalty equal to
10% of the face amount of the bill shall become due and payable; provided,
however, that if the fifteenth (15) day should fall upon a Sunday or legal

which is not a holiday. If the entire bill for both water service and sewer
service, together with the penalty of 10% thereof, shall remain unpaid for a
period of 30 days after the date the penalty is added, then pursuant to
authority of KRS 96.934 the water service connection to the premises shall be
disconnected, whether the same customer's water service bill has been paid or
not. If any such delinquent customer shall, thereafter, desire reconnection, a
charge in the sum of $40.00 is fixed to cover the expense thereof; and prior to
such reconnection, the customer shall be required to pay the delinquent bill,
the 10% penalty, and the charge for reconnection. Whether or not any premises
are disconnected because of such delinquency, the city attorney is authorized
and directed to enforce and collect the amount of any bills remaining
delinquent for thirty (30) days after penalty is added (including the penalty
and court costs), by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (B)   When it is necessary to enforce collection of sewer bills from
customers who receive sewer service from the city but receive water service
from another entity, such customers shall pay, in lieu of the reconnection
charge set forth in division (A) of this section, all connection,
disconnection, reconnection and other charges payable by the city to the water
provider to obtain enforcement of its sewer bills pursuant to KRS 96.934.

life of the agreement.
      (3)   Prior to the granting of an EDR each potential EDR customer shall
file an initial report with the City Council detailing anticipated increased
employment upon the establishment of the EDR and if the EDR is established,

      (5)   Any EDR agreement negotiated or entered into by the city, shall
contain language which allows the city to unilaterally rescind the EDR
agreement at such time as the city water system does not have adequate reserve
capacity to meet anticipated growth.
      (6)   The city shall demonstrate that rate classes which are not a party
to the EDR agreement will be no worse off than if the transaction had not
occurred.

§ 51.136 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Any user found to be violating any provisions of this chapter,
wastewater permit, or any order issued hereunder, shall be served by the city
with written notice stating the nature of the violations and providing a
reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender
shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all
violations. Within ten (10) days of the receipt date of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to
the Public Works Director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user
of potential liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of
the Notice of Violation.
   (B)   For all violations, the Public Works Director shall receive an
explanation and, as appropriate, a plan from the industrial user to correct a
violation within a specific time period. If the violations persist or the
explanation and/or plan are not adequate, the city's response shall be more
formal and commitments (or schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be
established in an enforceable document. The enforcement response selected will
be related to the seriousness of the violation. Enforcement responses will be
escalated if compliance is not achieved expeditiously after the initial action.
A significant non-compliance as defined in § 50.094 will require a formal
enforcement action.
   (C)   The full scale of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the
Enforcement Response Plan.

straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned

will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop": Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.

grantee's fiscal years. If, as a result of such audit or review, the government
determines that grantee has underpaid its fees in any twelve (12) month period
by five percent (5%) or more, then, in addition to making full payment of the
relevant obligation, grantee shall reimburse the government for all of the
verifiable costs associated with the audit or review, including costs for
attorneys, accountants and other consultants. Any additional amount due to the
government as a result of an audit or review shall be paid within the thirty
(30) days following written notice to the grantee by the government, which
notice shall include a copy of the audit report and copies of all invoices for
which the government seeks reimbursement.

an accord and satisfaction that the amount paid is in fact the release of any
claim that the government may have for further or additional sums payable under
this chapter.

§ 113.10 PUBLICATION COSTS.
   The grantee shall assume the cost of publication of the franchise as such
publication is required by law and such is payable upon the grantee's filing of
acceptance of the franchise.
(Ord. 1999-13, passed 11-8-99)
§ 113.11 TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.
   Whenever this chapter sets forth a time period in which any act shall be
performed, such time shall be deemed of the essence, and failure to perform
within the allotted time shall be sufficient grounds to invoke the remedies
available pursuant to §
113.99 or applicable law; provided, that either the grantee or the government
may waive any time period by failing to provide written notification to the
other of its intent to invoke such remedies within twelve (12) months after the

§ 113.23 LINE EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   Grantee is hereby authorized to extend the cable system as necessary,
as desirable or as required pursuant to the terms hereof within the city.
Whenever grantee shall receive a request for service from at least eight (8)
households within 2,640 feet (one-half mile) of its distribution plant, it
shall extend its cable system to such potential subscribers at no cost other
than the usual connection fees for all subscribers, provided that such
extension is technically feasible and will not adversely affect the operation,
financial condition or market development of the cable system. When counting
the number of potential subscriber households requesting service under this
provision, households then subscribing to a satellite direct-to-home service
shall be counted as one fourth (1/4) household.
   (B)   No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for
special circumstances (such as subscriber's request to locate the cable drop
underground, or the need for under highway crossings, or the existence of more
than two hundred fifty (250) feet between the distribution plant and the
subscriber connection, or a density of less than eight (8) households within
2,640 feet of Distribution Plant), Cable Service may be made available on the
basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including the cost of
material, labor and easements. When counting the number of potential subscriber
households within 500 feet of the distribution plant under this provision,
households then subscribing to a satellite direct-to-home service shall be
counted as one fourth (1/4) household. For the purpose of determining the
amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by grantee
and subscribers in the area in which cable service may be extended, grantee
will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per five
hundred (500) feet, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual
number of potential subscribers desiring service within five hundred (500) feet
of its distribution plant and whose denominator equals eight (8) subscribers.
Potential subscribers will bear the remainder of the construction and other
costs on a pro-rata basis. Grantee may require that the payment of the capital
contribution in aid of construction to be borne by such potential subscribers
be made in advance.
   (C)   Under normal operating conditions, extensions of the cable system made
pursuant to this section shall be completed within forty-five (45) days after
the conditions specified herein have been met and all necessary approvals and
equipment, including without limitation, pole attachment agreements,
governmental permits, and make-ready work, have been obtained or completed.

approvals within ten (10) business days after the conditions specified herein
have been met.

practices. Any interconnection shall be subject to and conditioned upon
financial arrangements which are mutually acceptable to Grantee and the other
broadband communication facility. Grantee shall pursue such negotiations in
good faith.

   The purpose of these regulations is to manage the placement of cellular
communication towers in unincorporated Anderson County and incorporated
Lawrenceburg to provide adequate cellular telecommunication service while
protecting the public and preserving the character and value of surrounding
property. The Lawrenceburg-Anderson County Joint Planning Commission (hereafter
called "Planning Commission"), Anderson County Fiscal Court and Lawrenceburg
City Council have the authority to plan for and regulate the siting of cellular
antenna towers in accordance with locally adopted planning or zoning
regulations, pursuant to KRS 100.987(1)
(Ord. 2010-06, passed 11-8-10)
§ 116.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context indicates or clearly requires a different meaning.
   "ANTENNAS OR RELATED EQUIPMENT." Transmitting, receiving or other equipment,
other than towers, used to support cellular telecommunications service or
personal communication service.
   "CELLULAR ANTENNA TOWER." A tower constructed for, or an existing facility
that has been adapted for, the location of transmission or related equipment to
be used in the provision of cellular telecommunications services or personal
wireless services (hereafter called "tower").
   "CELLULAR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE." A retail telecommunications service
that uses radio signals transmitted through cell sites and mobile switching
stations.
   "CO-LOCATION." Locating two (2) or more transmission antennas or related
equipment on the same cellular antenna tower.
   "GUYED TOWERS." A transmission tower supported by thin guy wires.
   "MONOPOLE TOWER." A slender self-supporting transmission tower.
   "PERSONAL COMMUNICATION SERVICE." As defined in 47 U.S.C. sec. 332(c).

the parties for use of the tower. Any other entity that co-locates transmission
or related facilities on a cellular antenna tower shall do so in a manner that
does not impose additional costs or operating restrictions on the primary user.
   (E)   If the proposed site of a cellular antenna tower is on property
subject to an existing Conditional Use Permit, the property owner shall obtain
approval of a modification request from the Board of Adjustment (BOA) Review of
the Conditional Use Permit plan shall be limited to a determination of the
impact of the cellular antenna tower construction on the requirements of the
Conditional Use Permit. The modification request shall be filed simultaneously
with the request to locate the cellular antenna tower. The property owner shall
be responsible for making any required alterations for the modification of a
Conditional Use Permit, or shall obtain a variance or waiver of any permit
requirement affected by the location of the cellular antenna tower on the site.
   (F)   All information contained in the application and any updates, except
for any map or other information that specifically identifies the proposed
location of the cellular antenna tower then being reviewed, shall be deemed
confidential and proprietary within the meaning of KRS 61.878. The Planning
Commission shall have no authority to grant any public request for the
inspection of this information, whether submitted under Kentucky's Open Records
Act or otherwise, except when ordered to release the information by a court of
competent jurisdiction. Any person violating this subsection shall be guilty of
official misconduct in the second degree as provided under KRS 522.030.

§ 117.15 REGULATORY LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   Pursuant to KRS 243.075, there is hereby imposed a regulatory license
fee upon the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of each
establishment licensed in the city to sell alcoholic beverages.
   (B)   The regulatory license fee authorized hereby shall be established at a
rate that will generate revenue that does not exceed the total of the
reasonable expenses actually incurred by the city in the immediately previous
fiscal year for the additional cost, as demonstrated by reasonable evidence,
of:
      (1)   Policing;
      (2)   Regulation; and
      (3)   Administration, as a result of the sale of alcoholic beverages
within the city.
   (C)   The regulatory license fee established hereby shall become
continuously effective on the first day of January, 2016 and shall apply

beverages.
   (D)   In the first year of effectiveness (FY 2016), the rate of the
regulatory license fee shall be set pursuant to KRS 243.075(5). The regulatory
license fee for Fiscal Year 2019 is established at the rate of five percent
(5%) of the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of each establishment
licensed in the city to sell alcoholic beverages.
   (E)   (1)   Beginning in Fiscal Year 2016-2017 and continuing thereafter,
the regulatory license fee rate for each fiscal year shall be established
according to the requirements set forth in division (B) above. Pursuant to said
requirements, the City Council may in conjunction with the adoption of the city
budget, annually establish the rate at which the regulatory license fee shall
be applied.
      (2)   Failure by the City Council to establish the rate for the
regulatory license fee by the first day of any fiscal year shall result in the
automatic setting of such rate, for that fiscal year, at such rate as was
applied in the immediately preceding fiscal year.
   (F)   (1)   Every establishment licensed in the city to sell alcoholic
beverages shall collect the regulatory license fee on a monthly basis and
shall:
         (a)   Fully and accurately complete a city ABC Regulatory Fee return,
on such form as shall be supplied by the city, reflecting the monthly gross
receipts for the sale of alcoholic beverages for such establishment and the
regulatory fee due thereon;
         (b)   Reporting. Deliver the completed quarterly return and all fees
collected hereunder to the city on a quarterly basis, no later than the 30th
day of the month next following the end of the quarter.
            1.   First quarter: July, August, September - Return due no later
than October 30th;
            2.   Second quarter: October, November, December - Return due no

      (2)   A penalty, payable by the licensed establishment shall be assessed
for failure to either file a return or to deliver all collected fees as
required herein. Said penalty shall be the greater of fifty dollars ($50) per
month for each month of non-compliance, or an amount equal to five percent (5%)
of the regulatory fee due for each month or months for which a return was not
filed or the regulatory fee was not collected and/or delivered.
      (3)   Failure by any establishment licensed in the city to sell alcoholic
beverages to either collect the regulatory license fee, or to deliver the
completed return and fees to the city within ten (10) days of the due date
shall additionally constitute a violation of the city ABC regulations and shall
subject the licensee to possible license suspension or revocation.
   (G)   All revenue received from the imposition of the regulatory license fee
authorized by this section, shall be:
      (1)   Deposited into a segregated fund established by the city;
      (2)   Spent only in accordance with the requirements of the Kentucky
Revised Statutes and this section; and
      (3)   Audited under an annual audit performed pursuant to KRS 43.070,
64.810, and 91A.040.

licenses permitted by law, but a credit against the fee shall be allowed in an
amount equal to any licenses or fee imposed by the city pursuant to KRS 243.060
and KRS 243.070.

   (B)   In determining the amount and method of paying a fine for commission
of a felony, the court shall consider, among others, the following factors:
      (1)   The defendant's ability to pay the amount of the fine;
      (2)   The hardship likely to be imposed on the defendant's dependents by
the amount of the fine and the time and method of paying it;

ability to make reparation or restitution to the victim; and
      (4)   The amount of the defendant's gain, if any, derived from the
commission of the offense.
   (C)   When a defendant is convicted of two or more felonies committed

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky has in KRS 82.082 delegated to local government units the authority to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council, hereby adopts the
following floodplain management ordinance, as follows.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundations which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by
the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood- prone areas in
such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
and
      (7)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in
a special flood hazard area.
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.

§ 154.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter it's most reasonable application.
   “A ZONE.” Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).” A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principle structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   “ACCESSORY USE.” A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without

compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.

to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty
(50) to one hundred (100) years. Structures that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In
addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject
to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance
rates.

appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (2) above.
      (4)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Ch. 350 shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Ch. 151 concerning the regulation of dams,
levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across or
along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Ch. 350 for surface coal mining operations.

accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation
is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set forth in the
citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or requesting a
hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the citation is issued
does not respond to the citation within seven days, that person shall be deemed
to have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a violation
occurred shall be considered final.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 154.20 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Council of Lawrenceburg hereby appoints the Mayor or designee to
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting
or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein
referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.21 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (A)   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or
other development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
154.04. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
      (1)   Application stage.
         (a)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
         (b)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level to which any
non-residential structure will be flood-proofed;
         (c)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood- proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§
154.31 and
154.33;
         (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      (2)   Construction stage. Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before
construction continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it
shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator and to the State a certification of the elevation of the lowest
floor or flood-proofed elevation, as built, in relation to Mean Sea Level. In
AE, A1-30, AH, and A zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base
flood elevation, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same.
   (B)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 154.30 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   In all special flood hazard areas the following provisions are
required:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy;
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or fame ties to ground anchors. This standard
shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for
resisting wind forces.
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
      (4)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (5)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding; and if
      (6)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (7)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
      (8)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;
   (B)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and
   (C)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter;
   (D)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not furthered, extended, or
replaced.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   (A)   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have
been provided, as set forth in §
154.04, the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential Construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor; including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
no lower than at or above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation
perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with standards of division(A)(3).
         (a)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth
number is specified.
         (b)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated at or above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states
as a part of the technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The
applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and
thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA
maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
(0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
         (c)   In all other Zones, elevated at or above the base flood
elevation.
         (d)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the
lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non- residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A)(1) or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities:
         (a)   Be floodproofed below an elevation at or above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         (b)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
         (c)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than at or above the level of the base flood
elevation; or
         (d)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall
be provided to the official as set forth in §
154.21(A)(1)(c).
         (e)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (A)(4).
         (f)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation at or above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
            1.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect; or
            2.   Have a minimum of two (2) openings with a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
      (3)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements
of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
         (a)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
            1.   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area
of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or
higher than the exterior foundation grade); and,
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
         (b)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and,
         (c)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
      (4)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
         (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include: On individual lots or
parcels:
            1.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            2.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
            3.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions; or
            4.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
            5.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result
of a flood.
         (b)   All manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than at or above the
level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
         (c)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage
as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that
the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than at or above the level of the base flood elevation, or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
         (d)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-
30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for "manufactured
homes".
         (e)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the state motor vehicle regulations, is
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
      (5)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established
in §
154.04, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
         (a)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
         (b)   If this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
154.30 et seq.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.32 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
154.04, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with this
chapter.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.33 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
154.04, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,

elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one (1) foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §
154.31(B).
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.34 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available
(Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood

certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.35 STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE
LETTER 'A'.
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated ‘A’
the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Structure must be non-habitable;
   (B)   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;
   (C)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one (1) foot above
grade, total openings are to be one (1) square inch per one (1) square foot of
floor area, at least two openings required on opposite walls;
   (D)   Built of flood resistant materials below a level at or above the base
flood elevation;
   (E)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;
   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking;

§ 154.36 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of the base flood
elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 154.45 NATURE OF VARIANCES. 
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.

§ 154.46 DESIGNATION OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
   The City Council shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of the City
Council.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.47 DUTIES OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
   (A)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
   (B)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local Circuit Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.48 APPEALS/VARIANCE PROCEDURES. 
   In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and the:
   (A)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
   (B)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   (C)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
   (D)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed
facility;
   (E)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of
functionally dependent facility;
   (F)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
   (G)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
   (H)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
   (I)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   (J)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
   (K)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.49 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES. 
   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (A)   Variances shall not be issued within, any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard.
"Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard. In
the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be made that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic
character and design of the structure.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under "PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE"), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
   (G)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of this section are satisfied and
that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize
flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats
to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.50 VARIANCE NOTIFICATION. 
   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that:
   (A)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25) for one hundred dollars ($100)
of insurance coverage; and
   (B)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Lawrenceburg Recorder and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.51 HISTORIC STRUCTURES. 
   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic
structures" (see definition) upon determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.52 NO IMPACT CERTIFICATION WITHIN THE FLOODWAY. 
   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 9-14-09)
§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and in addition, shall pay all
costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the Floodplain Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

CHAPTER 155: HISTORIC DISTRICTS
Section
   
155.01   Purpose
   
155.02   Definitions
   
155.03   Designation of historic districts, landmarks, and landmark sites
   
155.04   Changes to landmarks or property in historic districts; certificate of
appropriateness required
   
155.05   Maintenance, repair of landmarks or property in historic districts
   
155.06   Property assessment moratorium authorized
 
   
155.99   Penalty
§ 155.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council finds that losses of buildings downtown and vacancies
have resulted in concern about the future of the central business district,
that the city has begun a Main Street Program in cooperation with the state
government to help the central business district, the city has been involved in
the creation of a Preservation Council, and that the city has applied for
designation as a Renaissance City in recognition of its efforts to maintain a
vibrant central business district.
   (B)   The Council finds that many buildings having historic, architectural,
aesthetic, or cultural interest and value have been neglected, altered, or
destroyed notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of preserving and
continuing the use of such buildings and without adequate consideration of the
irreplaceable loss to the people of the city.
   (C)   The Council finds that neighborhoods and areas of the city have been
damaged and have deteriorated or are threatened because of new construction,
demolitions, alterations, and relocations that have harmed or will harm the
historic and architectural character of these neighborhoods and areas
notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of preserving and improving
these neighborhoods and areas through appropriate changes.
   (D)   The Council finds that the historic character of the central business
district is of vital importance in maintaining the economy of the city.
   (E)   The Council finds that the city has played an important role in the
development of Central Kentucky and that this growth is shown today through
buildings representing the city's role as a governmental, agricultural, and
commercial center. The Council finds that the city has buildings, historic
sites, and areas that represent the persons who live and work or who have lived
and worked in the city during its first 185 years. It is the finding of the
City Council that the distinctive and significant character of this city can
only be maintained by protecting and enhancing its historic, architectural,
aesthetic, and cultural heritage and by preventing unnecessary injury or
destruction of its landmarks and historic districts which are civic and
community assets.
   (F)   The Council finds that the federal and Kentucky governments have
passed laws to protect and preserve landmarks and historic districts, that some
of these laws provide incentives for historic preservation, and that the
National Historic Preservation Act was amended in 1980 to establish a certified
local government program creating a new federal-state-local partnership to
encourage the efforts by cities to protect and preserve their landmarks and
historic districts.
   (G)   The Council finds that this chapter benefits all residents of the city
and all owners of property.
   (H)   The Council declares as a matter of public policy that the
preservation, protection, perpetuation, and use of landmarks and historic
districts is a public necessity because they have a special or distinctive
character or special historic, architectural, aesthetic, or cultural interest
and value and thus serve as visible reminders of the history and heritage of
this city, state, and nation. The Council declares as a matter of public policy
that this chapter is required in the interest of the health, prosperity,
safety, welfare, and economic well-being of the people.
   (I)   The purpose of this chapter is to effect the goals as set forth in the
above findings and declarations of public policy and specifically, but not
exclusively, to do the following:
      (1)   Effect and accomplish the preservation, protection, perpetuation,
and use of historic districts, landmarks, and landmark sites having a special
or distinctive character or a special historic, architectural, aesthetic, or
cultural interest and value to the city, state, and nation.
      (2)   Promote the educational, cultural, economic, and general welfare of
the people and safeguard the city's history and heritage as embodied and
reflected in such landmarks, sites, and districts.
      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values in such districts and in the
city as a whole.
      (4)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable accomplishments of the
past.
      (5)   Strengthen the economy of the city.
      (6)   Protect and enhance the city's attractions to residents, tourists,
and visitors and serve as a support and stimulus to business and industry.
      (7)   Enhance the visual and aesthetic character, diversity, and interest
of the city.
      (8)   Enhance and preserve available housing stock within the city.
      (9)   Facilitate coordination between various city agencies having
jurisdiction over buildings and their use in the city.
   (J)   The Council finds that the loss of a building or structure on a
historic property causes irreparable harm to all the citizens of the city who
cannot be made whole by the mere payment of monetary damages.

§ 155.03 DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC DISTRICTS, LANDMARKS, AND LANDMARK SITES.
   (A)   The Commission shall recommend to the City Council the designation of
individual landmarks and landmark sites and historic districts, and the City
Council may make these designations by enactment of ordinances.
   (B)   Consideration of the designation of a landmark and landmark site or a
historic district may be originated by the Commission or by the filing of an
application for designation by a property owner, any resident of the city, or
any organization in the city. A person or an organization proposing a
designation shall give the Commission the names and addresses of the owners of
the affected property and the owners of all adjoining property as listed on the
tax rolls of the city.
   (C)   The Commission shall assemble information about a property or district
being considered for designation and shall schedule a public hearing on the
proposed designation. Advertised notice of the hearing shall be given,
including conspicuous posting on the property or in the proposed district. At
least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing written notice shall be
given by first class mail to the owners of property under consideration and the
owners of all adjoining property. The Coordinator of the Commission or other
officer of the Commission shall certify that the notices were mailed. Written
notice shall be considered sufficient when it is mailed to the person or
persons listed as owning affected property on the tax rolls of the city.
   (D)   The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and such
other guidelines of general application as the Commission may from time to time
adopt after public hearing shall apply to all designated property in the city.
Before each public hearing on a designation, the Commission may adopt
additional guidelines that will supplement the Secretary's guidelines and will
apply to the property under consideration if it is designated. The guidelines
shall not limit new construction to any one architectural style but shall seek
to preserve the character and integrity of the designated property. The
guidelines may suggest changes that would be appropriate for designated
property. After a designation, the Commission may expand or amend the
guidelines it has adopted provided it holds a public hearing on the changes and
submits the proposed changes to the Joint Planning Commission and the City
Council for their comments.
   (E)   A landmark or historic district shall qualify for designation when it
meets one (1) or more of the following criteria which shall be discussed in a
Commission report making its recommendations to the City Council.
      (1)   Its value as a reminder of the cultural or archeological heritage
of the city, state, or nation.
      (2)   Its location as a site of a significant local, state, or national
event.
      (3)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the city, state, or nation.
      (4)   Its identification as the work of a master builder, designer, or
architect whose individual work has influenced the development of the city,
state, or nation.
      (5)   Its value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that retains sufficient elements showing its architectural
significance.
      (6)   Its distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style
valuable for the study of a period, method of construction, or use of
indigenous materials.
      (7)   Its character as a geographically definable area possessing a
significant concentration, or continuity of sites, buildings, objects, or
structures united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical
development.
      (8)   Its character as an established and geographically definable
neighborhood, united by culture, architectural style, or physical plan and
development.
   (F)   After evaluating the testimony at its public hearing, survey
information, and other material it has assembled, the Commission shall make its
recommendation to the City Council with a written report on the property or
area under consideration. The report shall contain information about
significant buildings, structures, established trees, and other site
characteristics included in the proposed designation. The recommendation and
the report shall also be sent to the Joint Planning Commission.
   (G)   The Joint Planning Commission shall then report on the relationship
between the proposed designation and existing and future plans for the
development of the city. If the Joint Planning Commission approves of the
proposed designation, it shall amend the comprehensive plan to include the
proposed designation and shall recommend a change in the zoning map to show the
proposed historic designation. The Joint Planning Commission shall forward its
comments, the Comprehensive Plan Amendment, and the zoning map change to the
City Council. If the Joint Planning Commission does not approve of the proposed
designation, it shall forward its comments to the City Council. The Joint
Planning Commission shall provide its comments and any Comprehensive Plan
Amendment and zoning map change to the City Council within sixty (60) days of
receiving the Commission's recommendation. Failure of the Joint Planning
Commission to take any action within this time shall be deemed a favorable
comment upon the Commission's recommendation.
   (H)   The City Council shall approve, modify, or disapprove the proposed
designation within sixty (60) days after receiving the recommendation of the
Commission and the material from the Joint Planning Commission. If the City
Council decides to make a designation and no comprehensive plan amendment has
been adopted and no zoning map change has been recommended, the City Council
shall request the Joint Planning Commission to reconsider its earlier decisions
and shall provide that the designation shall take effect after these
preliminary steps have been approved. If the City Council fails to take action
on the recommendation of the Commission within this time, the recommendation of
the Commission shall be deemed approved by operation of law.
   (I)   The Commission shall notify each owner of the decision relating to his
property and shall record the designation of a property as a landmark or as a
part of a historic district in the land records of the county. The Commission
shall ask that fees be waived for the city documents recording the
designations. The Commission shall also give notices of the decision to the
government offices in the city and county which shall retain them for future
reference.
   (J)   The amendment or rescission of any designation shall be accomplished
through the same steps as were followed in the original designation.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 2-13-06)
§ 155.04 CHANGES TO LANDMARKS OR PROPERTY IN HISTORIC DISTRICTS; CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED.
   (A)   The owner(s) or others acting on behalf of an owner(s) shall apply for
a certificate from the Commission before undertaking new work affecting a
historic property. No fee shall be required for applications timely filed
before new work has begun.
   (B)   The Commission may delegate its authority to issue certificates for
new work to its staff in appropriate instances. The Commission shall prepare a
list of routine alterations that shall receive immediate approval from its
staff without a public meeting when an applicant complies with the
specifications of the Commission.
   (C)   The owner(s) or persons acting on behalf of the owner(s) who apply for
a certificate after new work has begun on a historic property shall pay a fifty
dollar ($50) application fee to cover administrative costs and the application
shall be heard by the Commission.
   (D)   All applicants for certificates shall supply the Commission with scale
drawings of the proposed work, photographs of the existing building or
structure or site and adjacent properties, and information about the building
materials to be used. Commission staff may waive any of these requirements in
an appropriate case.
   (E)   No building permits, zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, or
demolition permits shall be issued by the Code Enforcement Officer or any other
officer of the city unless the application for the permit or certificate of
occupancy is accompanied by a certificate issued by the Commission, a
resolution of City Council under division (O) of this section, or a final order
of the Circuit Court.
   (F)   In the event new work is being performed without the required
certificate, a Stop Work Order shall be issued by the Police Chief or the City
Clerk upon written request of the Commission. Once a copy of the issued Stop
Work Order has been posted on the affected historic property, all work shall
cease on the designated property and no additional new work shall be undertaken
as long as such Stop Work Order shall continue in effect. Any law enforcement
officer may cite violators of a Stop Work Order in District Court and the
Commission may apply in Circuit Court for an injunction to enforce its Stop
Work Order.
   (G)   (1)   The Coordinator shall review all applications upon receipt and
shall present those which are complete to the Commission for its review. Any
application which does not include all required information shall be returned
to the applicant and shall not be considered by the Commission.
      (2)   The Commission shall review at a regular monthly public meeting
each application for certificate within thirty (30) days after a completed
application is received by the Commission except for applications which are
staff-approvable as provided in division (B). The Commission shall make a
decision on the application within forty-five (45) days after the meeting at
which it is first considered provided that the Commission may extend the time
for decision an additional sixty (60) days for a total of 135 days from receipt
of a completed application when the application is for demolition, relocation,
or new construction. The Commission shall approve or disapprove each
application, and it shall give its reasons for its decision using the criteria
contained in this section and in its guidelines. The Commission may suggest
modifications to an application and may then approve a certificate
incorporating those modifications. If the Commission fails to decide on an
application within the specified time period, the application shall be deemed
approved unless the applicant and the Commission have agreed in writing to an
extension. Applicants shall be given notice of the public hearings and meetings
relating to their applications and shall be informed of the Commission's
decision.
      (3)   Any application, other than an application brought by the Code
Enforcement Officer under division (O) of this section, which has been
disapproved by vote of the Commission, shall not become final for ninety (90)
days during which period the Commission and the applicant shall continue
negotiations in an effort to agree upon an alternative which will comply with
the Commission's guidelines. The Commission, after notice to the applicant, may
hold additional hearings and hear additional evidence, and may reconsider its
initial disapproval. All of these actions shall become a part of the
administrative record.
      (4)   A certificate shall remain valid for one (1) year after it is
issued. Work is required to start before the end of the one (1) year period. If
the approved work has not been completed within two (2) years after the
certificate was issued, the Commission shall review the situation and may
require a renewed application for a certificate for the work that remains to be
done.
   (H)   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall be aware
of the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the applicant.
The Commission shall also recognize the importance of approving plans that will
be reasonable for the applicant to carry out. Before an applicant prepares his
plans, he may bring a tentative proposal to the Commission for its comments.
   (I)   In reviewing applications involving signs, the Commission shall use
guidelines it has prepared that have been approved by the City Council. Owners
and tenants shall apply to the Commission before their signs are made.
   (J)   As the purpose of this chapter and the Historic District Commission,
as set forth at length in the legislative findings in §
155.01, is to prevent demolition of historic properties, applications for
permits to demolish will be granted only in extraordinary circumstances. Any
owner(s) or person acting on behalf of the owner(s) who applies for a
demolition permit shall, as part of the application, give written permission to
the Commission to make or have made such inspections of the building or
structure for which the permit is sought as the Commission finds are
appropriate and for the Commission to take any temporary measures it deems
necessary to prevent further deterioration of the building or structure while
the matter is under consideration. Any inspections or temporary remedial
measures taken by the Commission shall be at its cost. An application for a
permit for demolition may be approved by the Commission only if the applicant
proves, to the satisfaction of the Commission, at least one of the following:
      (1)   That the building or structure or portion thereof which the
applicant seeks to demolish is not original to the structure and does not
contribute to the structure or district.
      (2)   That the structure or building has, through no fault of the owner
(s), deteriorated to such an extent that it is no longer significant under the
criteria listed in §
155.03(E).
      (3)   That the structure or building has deteriorated to such an extent
it cannot be rehabilitated without economic hardship to the owner(s).
         (a)   If the deterioration has been caused or allowed to continue
after the owner(s) have been given notice to repair the building or structure
by the Historic District Coordinator or Code Enforcement Officer, the
Commission may table the application for a period of one year from the hearing.
         (b)   In considering the economic hardship to the owner(s), the
Commission may exclude the costs of repair and rehabilitation which have been
caused by the failure of the owner(s) and any previous owner(s) within the five
years prior to the date of the application to take appropriate remedial action
after receiving notice from the Historic District Coordinator or Code
Enforcement Officer.
         (c)   During the period when the application for demolition permit is
lying on the table, the City or the Commission may make such temporary repairs
to the building or structure as either deems necessary to prevent further
deterioration of the building or structure.
      (4)   That the structure or building has deteriorated to such an extent
that, even if rehabilitated, the owner(s) could not earn a return on investment
in the building or structure commensurate with that earned by owners of
similarly situated historic properties which have been maintained in sound
condition.
   (K)   When the applicant wishes to move a building or structure on a
historic property or wishes to move a building or structure to a historic
property, the Commission shall consider the following:
      (1)   The contribution the building or structure makes to its present
setting.
      (2)   Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated.
      (3)   Whether the building or structure can be moved without significant
damage to its physical integrity.
      (4)   The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed site
and adjacent properties.
      (5)   Those criteria set forth in §
155.03(E), above.
   (L)   Except as provided in division (O) of this section, the applicant may
appeal to the Circuit Court within thirty (30) days after an adverse decision
of the Commission on an application for a certificate becomes final. All final
actions of the Commission which have not been appealed within thirty (30) days
shall not be subject to judicial review.
   (M)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be undertaken without a
certificate provided this work on a historic property does not change its
exterior appearance that is visible to the public.
   (N)   In any case where the Code Enforcement Officer determines that there
are emergency conditions immediately dangerous to life, health, or other
property affecting a historic property, he may order the remedying of these
conditions by the owner(s) in a manner consistent with this chapter and the
guidelines of the Commission without the approval of the Commission. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall promptly notify the Chairman and Coordinator of the
Commission of the action being taken.
   (O)   If, in the judgment of the Code Enforcement Officer, the only viable
remedy for the emergency conditions requires demolition of a historic property,
he shall seek approval of the Commission which shall meet within twenty-four
(24) hours of receipt of notice from the Code Enforcement Officer to consider
the request.
      (1)   If the Commission concurs with the recommendation of the Code
Enforcement Officer, it shall issue an emergency certificate.
      (2)   If the Commission concludes that further information is needed to
consider the request, it may defer decision on the matter for fourteen (14)
days during which it may seek expert advice on the condition of the historic
property and means for remedying the emergency condition. If at the end of the
fourteen (14) days the Commission concurs with the Code Enforcement Officer, it
shall issue an emergency certificate.
      (3)   If the Commission concludes that there are other viable means for
remedying the emergency condition, it may deny the request of the Code
Enforcement Officer.

damaged or otherwise fall into a state of disrepair.
   (B)   The purpose of this section is to prevent a person from forcing the
demolition of his building by neglecting it and permitting damage to the
building by weather or vandalism. No provision of this chapter shall be
interpreted to require an owner or tenant to undertake an alteration or to
restore his building to its original appearance for that purpose only.
   (C)   The Commission shall request in writing a meeting with a property
owner when his historic property is in poor repair, and the Commission shall
discuss with the owner ways to improve the condition of his property. The
notice shall also inform the owner that, if he does not make satisfactory
progress in improving the condition of the property within thirty (30) days of
the notice, the matter shall be heard at the next regular meeting of the
Commission following the thirty (30) day notice, at which hearing the property
owner shall be entitled to appear before the Commission.

has failed:
      (1)   To prevent the property from becoming unfit for human habitation,
occupancy, or use, or
      (2)   To remedy any condition which is dangerous or injurious to the
health or safety of the occupants of the structure, the occupants of
neighboring structures, or other residents of the city, the city shall, at the
request of the Commission, undertake necessary remedial measures, including but
not limited to boarding doors, windows, and other parts of the building, and
additional steps to stabilize walls, roofs, and other parts of a building or
structure.
   (E)   The city shall have a lien against the property for the reasonable
value of labor and materials used in remedying the situation. The affidavit of
the Code Enforcement Officer or Historic District Coordinator shall constitute
prima facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the regularity of the
proceedings pursuant to this chapter, and shall be recorded in the office of
the Anderson County Clerk. The lien shall be notice to all persons from the
time of its recording and shall bear interest thereafter until paid. The lien
created shall take precedence over all other subsequent liens, except state,
county, school board, and city taxes, and may be enforced by judicial
proceeding.
   (F)   In addition to the remedy prescribed in division (F) of this section
or any other remedy authorized by law, the owner of a property upon which a
lien has been attached pursuant to this section shall be personally liable for
the amount of the lien, including all interest, civil penalties, and other
charges and the Commission may bring a civil action against the owner and shall
have the same remedies as provided for the recovery of a debt owed.
   (G)   The provisions of this section shall be in addition to all other
provisions of the Kentucky Building Code and Chapters 92 and 150 of the
Ordinances of the City of Lawrenceburg requiring buildings and structures to be
kept in good repair.

Enforcement Agency of the city prior to allowing discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2014-006, passed 10-13-14)
§ 156.025 OTHER DISCHARGES.
   The prohibition of discharges or flows shall not apply to any non-stormwater
discharges permitted under a NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered by the Kentucky Division of Water
under the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the
discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver,
or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
(Ord. 2014-006, passed 10-13-14)
§ 156.026 STORM DISCHARGE PERMIT.
   Discharges pursuant to a valid and effective NPDES permit issued by the
Commonwealth of Kentucky are not prohibited by this section. Any person,
company, developer or any other entity subject to a construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit or land disturbance permit shall comply with all
provisions of such permits. Proof of compliance with such permits may be
required in a form acceptable to the city.
(Ord. 2014-006, passed 10-13-14)
§ 156.027 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Elimination of illicit discharges. Notwithstanding the requirements of
this section herein, the Enforcement Agency of the city may require by written
notice that a person responsible for an illicit discharge immediately, or by a
specified date, discontinues the discharge and, if necessary, take measures to
eliminate the source of the discharge to prevent the occurrence of future
illicit discharges.
   (B)   Monitoring of discharges. Upon written request to the person, the city
shall have safe and easy access to the areas to be inspected and/or monitored.
Temporary or permanent obstructions to safe and easy access to the site to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner at the written
or oral request of the Enforcement Agency of the city. The city shall be
provided access to all parts of the premises subject to this section for the
purposes of inspection, monitoring, sampling and for the performance of other
duties necessary to determine compliance with this section. The person
responsible for any violation of this chapter with regard to illicit discharges
shall be liable for expenses incurred by monitoring and analyses.
      (1)   The Enforcement Agency of the city has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (2)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
   (C)   Remediation. Any person responsible for illicit discharges and who
fails to correct any prohibited condition or discontinue any prohibited
activity at the order of the city, shall be liable to the city for expenses
incurred in abating pollution. This may include expenses incurred in testing,
measuring, sampling, collecting, removing, treating, and disposing of the
polluting materials and preventing further noncompliance and/or illicit
discharges.
   (D)   Accidental discharges. 
      (1)   If an emergency response by governmental agencies is needed, the
owner or operator should call 911 immediately to report the discharge. A
written report must be provided to the city within five days of the time the
discharger becomes aware of the circumstances, unless this requirement is
waived by the city for good cause shown as determined by the city or its
designee on a case-by-case basis, containing the following information:
         (a)   A description of the discharge including volumes and
concentrations;
         (b)   The exact dates and times of discharge; and
         (c)   Steps being taken to eliminate and prevent recurrence of the
discharge.
      (2)   The discharger shall take all reasonable steps to minimize any
adverse impact to the MS4 or the Waters of the Commonwealth, including
accelerated or additional monitoring necessary to determine the nature and
impact of the discharge. It shall not be a defense, for the discharger in an
enforcement action, to claim that it would have been necessary to halt or
reduce the business or activity of the facility in order to maintain storm
water quality and minimize any adverse impact that the discharge may cause.
   (E)   Notification of spills, non-hazardous. In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Enforcement Agency for
the city in person, by phone, email, city’s website, or facsimile no later than
5:00 p.m. of the next business day. Notifications shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the
notice.

§ 156.028 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The Enforcement Agency of the city will adopt requirements identifying Best
Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause
or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2014-006, passed 10-13-14)
§ 156.029 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, yard waste, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of
water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2014-006, passed 10-13-14)
§ 156.030 INSPECTION AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Inspection. Whenever the Enforcement Agency of the city has cause to
believe that there exists, or potentially exists, any condition which
constitutes a violation of this section, the Enforcement Agency of the city may
enter the suspect property, MS4, community waters and waters of the
Commonwealth at all reasonable times to inspect the same. If it is determined
an illicit discharge emanates from private premises, the owner or operator of
the premises will be notified in accordance with the provisions of this
section. Copies of records of stormwater compliance shall be provided to the
Enforcement Agency of the city.
   (B)   Sampling devices and testing. During any inspection as provided
herein, the Enforcement Agency of the city may take any samples and perform any
testing deemed necessary, including long-term monitoring, to aid in the pursuit
of the inquiry or to record site activities. The cost of all testing may be
passed on to the owner or operator of the premises where the illicit discharge
emanates.

§ 156.045 EPSC REQUIREMENTS.
   The city shall review all EPSC plans for compliance with the following
general standards and review criteria:
   (A)   A design removal efficiency goal of 80% for total suspended solids
from land disturbing activities shall be applied to the design, review, and
approval of EPSC plans. The following structural and non-structural standards
are to be utilized to achieve this goal.
      (1)   Compliance with the Stormwater Manual, as it may be revised from
time to time, for the City of Lawrenceburg.
      (2)   Non-structural site management practices to prevent erosion and
minimize sediment discharge shall be considered. Such practices include the
following standards:
         (a)   Minimize site disturbance to preserve and maintain existing
vegetative cover;
         (b)   Limit the number of temporary access points to the site for land
disturbing activities;
         (c)   Phase and sequence construction activities;
         (d)   Locate temporary and permanent soil disposal areas, haul roads
and construction staging areas to minimize erosion, sediment transport and
disturbance to existing vegetation.
   (B)   Where attainment of this design removal efficiency goal through the
use of structural and non-structural measures is not practicable, the permittee
shall submit written justification to the city for review and approval.
(Ord. 2014-006, passed 10-13-14)
§ 156.046 PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Erosion protection and sediment control for construction projects
requires continual planning, observation and action for all components of the
overall plan. The process will be documented through requirements established
by the Kentucky Division of Water, and implemented in their KYR10 permit. While
stormwater management plans typically contain permanent treatment practices
(PTPs) instead of temporary practices, the initial plan submittal must address
permanent stormwater management including water quality. A general description
of each type of plan follows:
      (1)   Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan. A Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) is a living document that is first submitted for
approval to the City and to the KDOW. It will be updated, as necessary, as
development continues. It includes site map(s), an identification of
construction/contractor activities that could cause pollutant discharges into
stormwater and a description of measures or practices to control these
pollutants. The SWPPP is required by KYR10. It includes the EPSC Plan and
Stormwater Management Plan. Once the development plan has been approved, a copy
of the SWPPP must be maintained onsite and should include copies of all permits
issued for the site. Inspection documentation and plan revisions must also be
documented in the SWPPP once site development has begun.
      (2)   Construction EPSC Plan. Once the erosion prevention and sediment
control (EPSC) plan has been approved, it becomes a component of the SWPPP. The
EPSC Plan is a set of plans prepared by or under the direction of a licensed
professional engineer detailing the specific measures and sequencing to be used
to control sediment and erosion on a development site during and after
construction. It includes supporting calculations, a construction schedule, and
schematics and cross-sections for clarification, as well as any other material
in support of the EPSC plan. As the project progresses, revisions and
modifications should be tracked in the SWPPP, with major modifications
requiring prior approval by the city before implementation.
      (3)   Post-construction Stormwater Quality Management Plan. The post-
construction stormwater quality management plan (P-SWQMP) contains permanent
water quality treatment devices, such as detention structures, outlet
protection, stormwater conveyance devices, and bioretention areas. Once
approved, the P-SWQMP becomes a component of the SWPPP. Some of these
components will not be installed during initial construction activities.
However, knowing the proposed locations during early construction activities
can be beneficial so areas can be appropriately staged. For example, permanent
detention structures can first function as sediment basins. Once permanent
controls have been installed, they should be protected from sediment laden
runoff, as many permanent water quality treatment devices rely on infiltration
for treatment and can easily be overwhelmed.
   (B)   Sites where land disturbance activities are proposed will require a
complete Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) approved by the Issuing
Authority of the city.
   (C)   The SWPP plan shall be prepared by a licensed engineer. The engineer
shall be required to visit the site, in person, to evaluate the existing
conditions before preparation of the SWPPP. The engineer shall notify the city
at least five days prior to the visit. The city may choose to visit the site
with the engineer. The engineer shall prepare the report, including all of the
maps and sketches required.
   (D)   The report shall be bound, on 8 ½" x 11" paper. All plan drawings
shall be folded and inserted (the size and scale of the plans may vary
depending on the nature of the project; some critical areas might require an
enlargement, or “blow-up sheet”). The report may be placed in a folder, binder
or three-ring binder, depending on the scope and size of the report. If the
report is in a folder or binder, the outside of the folder/binder shall include
as a minimum: Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, the name and address of the
project, any additional documentation to identify the project per city
requirements, the owner of the project, the consultant’s name and contact
information and date of submission.
   (E)   The SWPPP and EPSC plans shall be readily available at the
construction site from the date of project initiation (NOI) to the date of
Notice of Termination (NOT).
   (F)   Format and contents of the SWPPP will follow the outline presented in
the Stormwater Manual.

POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 156.060 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The primary objective of the city’s NPDES Phase II Stormwater Program
is to protect and enhance the pre-development stormwater runoff
characteristics; reduce stream bank and channel erosion; reduce siltation and
sedimentation in the community waters and waters of the Commonwealth; and lower
the discharge of pollutants from impervious areas.
   (B)   The city is required to address runoff from post-construction areas to
fully comply with federally mandated stormwater regulations including
activities such as establishing policies, procedures, standards and criteria
relating to stormwater runoff quality and quantity, and establishing
maintenance agreements for long term operation and maintenance of BMPs.
(Ord. 2014-006, passed 10-13-14)
§ 156.061 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Post-construction stormwater management in areas undergoing new
development or redevelopment is necessary because runoff from these areas has
been shown to significantly affect receiving water bodies. Post-construction
pollutant loadings will be controlled through the six minimum control measures
under the KPDES stormwater permit.
   (B)   Redevelopment projects are required to meet 20% of the local water
quality standard.
   (C)   The design of structural BMPs shall be by a professional engineer
licensed to practice in the field civil engineering.
   (D)   The property owner shall be responsible for all maintenance and record
keeping and reporting as detailed in the maintenance agreement.
   (E)   The city and its agents shall have right of entry to inspect, observe,
test or perform any other activity related to the operation, maintenance and
function of the stormwater infrastructure.
   (F)   General requirements for post-construction stormwater control
requirements for design, maintenance and a menu of BMPs are located in the
post-construction section of the city’s Stormwater Manual. These regulations in
the manual shall be the standard practice for post-construction compliance in
the city.
   (G)   Stream corridor protection BMPs shall be utilized to protect
designated streams and waterways through conservation methods. These methods
may include buffer strips, greenways, vegetated channels, stream bank
stabilization and restoration.
   (H)   Impervious area runoff controls shall be utilized to address high
levels of runoff quantity and reduced quality associated with high-density
developments. These controls may include preservation of open space, minimizing
impervious surfaces, porous pavement, utilization of grass swales instead of
curb and gutter, reduced pavement widths and similar measures.
   (I)   Discharge control BMPs shall be utilized to provide flow attenuation
for post-development runoff. These BMPs may include detention facilities,
extended detention basins, retention facilities and artificial wetlands.
   (J)   If a new development or redevelopment project contributes runoff to
downstream receiving waters that are impaired or infrastructure that does not
have sufficient capacity, the city may, at its discretion, require stormwater
management controls greater than the minimum required by this section. Drainage
calculations shall be provided by the developer’s engineer to demonstrate the
integration with the downstream hydraulic system.
   (K)   All facilities must be designed to require minimal maintenance to
ensure that the facilities do not become nuisances or health hazards.
Maintenance expectations shall be clearly stated in the maintenance agreement.
   (L)   The Approving Agency of the city, at its discretion, may require the
developer of a new development or redevelopment project to pay a stormwater
improvement fee in lieu of the installation of stormwater BMP improvements. The
requirements set forth in this section are intended to:
      (1)   Develop and implement strategies which include a combination of
structural and/or non-structural best management practices (BMPs) that prevent
or minimize water quality impacts from developments in the City of
Lawrenceburg;
      (2)   Ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of BMPs;
      (3)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities; and
      (4)   Encourage the preservation of floodplains, floodways and open
spaces to protect and benefit the community’s quality of life and natural
resources.
(Ord. 2014-006, passed 10-13-14)
§ 156.062 APPLICATION.
   (A)   This section shall apply to any of the following:

(Ord. 2014-006, passed 10-13-14)
§ 156.064 REVIEW AND ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   The city shall require all new development and redevelopment to develop a
maintenance plan and enter into a long-term operation and maintenance agreement
with approved best management practices for all stormwater quality BMPs.
   (A)   Maintenance agreements.
      (1)   Any stormwater management facility or BMP that is not owned by the
city will be required to have a maintenance agreement.
      (2)   Any storm water management facility or BMP which services
individual property owners shall be privately owned. General routine
maintenance (controlling vegetative growth and removing debris) shall be
provided by the owner(s). The owner shall maintain a perpetual, non-exclusive
easement that allows for access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the
city. The city has the right, but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency
repairs.
      (3)   Any storm water management facility or BMP which services an
individual residential subdivision in which the facility or BMP is within
designated open areas or serves as an amenity with an established homeowners
association shall be privately owned and maintained consistent with provisions
of this chapter. The owner shall maintain a perpetual, nonexclusive easement
which allows access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The
City has the right, but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (4)   Any storm water management facility or BMP which services
commercial and industrial development shall be privately owned and maintained.
The owner shall maintain a perpetual, nonexclusive easement which allows access
for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The city has the right,
but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (5)   All regional storm water management control facilities proposed by
the owners, if approved and accepted by the city for dedication as a public
regional facility, shall be publicly owned and/or maintained. All other storm
water management control facilities and BMPs shall be privately owned and/or
maintained unless accepted for maintenance by the city.
      (6)   The city may require dedication of privately owned storm water
facilities, which discharge to the city storm water system. This shall be at
the approval of the Board of Commissioners.
      (7)   The maintenance and proper operation of all privately owned
stormwater management facilities, including nonstructural practices, shall be
ensured through the creation of a formal and enforceable maintenance agreement
that must be approved by the City and recorded in the office of the County
Clerk as a deed restriction on the property prior to final plan approval. This
agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and
inspect the stormwater management practices, and will outline the procedures
and schedule to be followed to perform routine maintenance as necessary to
ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management practice. Maintenance
may include vegetation clearing, mowing, and removing accumulated trash,
debris, sediment pollutants and other forms of pollution. In addition, the
legally binding agreement shall identify the parties responsible for the proper
maintenance of all stormwater treatment practices and include plans for
periodic inspections by the owners, or their designated agent, to ensure proper
performance of the facility. The maintenance agreement shall be consistent with
the terms and conditions of the “Stormwater Control Facility Maintenance
Agreement”.
      (8)   The city may accept, at its discretion, dedication of any existing
or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such
facility meets all the requirements of this chapter and includes adequate and
perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection
and regular maintenance. The city will not accept any facility that serves as
an amenity feature for any property or development. A maintenance agreement
will not be required in this instance.
   (B)   Maintenance easement. The applicant or owner of the site must execute
a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on the owner, its
administrators, executors, assigns, heirs, and any other successors in interest
of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall
provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection
by the City of Lawrenceburg, or their contractor or agent, to ensure that the
facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and
any other provisions established by this chapter and to, if necessary,
implement emergency repairs to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
public. The easement dimensions shall be as directed by the city and the
easement agreement shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk, with a
copy provided to the city. All stormwater management facilities within
subdivision plats shall also be protected by a permanent easement for the same
purposes as above and also to prohibit any construction on the easement that
would be detrimental to the performance of those facilities.
   (C)   Requirements of maintenance agreements. 
      (1)   The post-construction maintenance plan shall ensure that BMPs are
operated and maintained to achieve the goals of this chapter, and not permit
the required facilities from becoming nuisances or health hazards.
      (2)   Written procedures for operation and maintenance and training new
maintenance personnel.
      (3)   An annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs to
ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter and accomplishment of
its purposes. These needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other debris
from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation
removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation.
      (4)   Any maintenance needs found must be identified in writing, along
with the schedule and methods to be employed to complete the maintenance. The
maintenance repairs and restoration schedules are to be approved by the city
prior to commencing the work and the city shall inspect the facility upon
completion of the work. The inspection and maintenance requirement may be
increased by the city as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the
stormwater management facility.
   (D)   Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management
facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and
repairs, and shall retain the records for at least five years. These records
shall be made available to the city during inspection of the facility and at
other reasonable times upon request.
   (E)   Maintenance guarantees for privately owned stormwater facilities.
      (1)   Single entity ownership – Where the permanent storm water runoff
control facilities are designed to manage runoff from property in a single
entity ownership, the maintenance responsibility for the storm water control
facilities shall be with the single entity owner.
      (2)   A single entity shall be defined as an association, public or
private corporation, partnership firm, trust, estate or any other legal entity
allowed to own real estate exclusive of an individual lot owner.
      (3)   Upon approval of the storm water quality BMPs by the city, the
facility owner(s) shall demonstrate the ability to guarantee and apply the
financial resources necessary for long-term maintenance requirements. The
funding mechanism shall be in a form approved by the city. The city will only
approve funding mechanism(s) for long-term maintenance responsibilities that
can be demonstrated to be permanent or transferable to another entity with
equivalent longevity.
      (4)   In the event that proposed funding is through an owners
association, then it must be demonstrated that the association may not dissolve
unless long-term operation and maintenance activities are accepted by another
entity with equivalent longevity and adequate funding. Furthermore, the owners
association’s responsibility must be stated in the association’s declaration,
covenants, or by-laws, as appropriate.
      (5)   Unless made specifically clear in the preliminary stages of the
site design and construction plan review procedure, it will be assumed that all
storm water detention, retention, treatment or storage facilities and/or
devices shall be owned, operated and maintained by a single entity as defined
above.
      (6)   Where stormwater management and erosion and sediment control
facilities are to be operated and maintained by the applicant or by a
corporation that owns or manages a commercial or industrial facility, the
applicant, prior to construction, may be required to provide the city with an
irrevocable letter of credit from an approved financial institution or surety
to ensure proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater management and
erosion control facilities both during and after construction, and until the
city acknowledges compliance with all details of approved site plan. If the
applicant or landowner fails to properly operate and maintain stormwater
management and erosion and sediment control facilities, the city may draw upon
the account to cover the costs of proper operation and maintenance, including
engineering and inspection costs, until the city acknowledges compliance with
all details of approved site plan.
