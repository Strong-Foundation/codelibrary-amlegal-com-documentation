require the applicant to provide a statement in the written application of the
manner in which the applicant is a resident of the Commonwealth under KRS

      (1)   The written application shall be:
         (a)   Hand delivered;
         (b)   Mailed;
         (c)   Sent via facsimile; or
         (d)   Sent via e-mail to the public agency's official custodian of
public records or his or her designee at the e-mail address designated in the
public agency's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to KRS 61.876.
      (2)   A public agency shall not require the use of any particular form
for the submission of an open records request, but shall accept for any request
the standardized form developed under KRS 61.876(4). (KRS 61.872(2))
   (B)   All public records shall be open for inspection by any resident of the
Commonwealth, except as otherwise provided by KRS 61.870 to 61.884, and

copies of public records from the offices of any public agency without the
written permission of the official custodian of the record. (KRS 61.872(1))
   (C)   A resident of the Commonwealth may inspect the public records:
      (1)   During the regular office hours of the public agency; or
      (2)   By receiving copies of the public records from the public agency
through the mail. The public agency shall mail copies of the public records to
a person whose residence or principal place of business is outside the county
in which the public records are located after he or she precisely describes the
public records which are readily available within the public agency. If the
resident of the Commonwealth requesting the public records requests that copies
of the records be mailed, the official custodian shall mail the copies upon
receipt of all fees and the cost of mailing. (KRS 61.872(3))
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all written public records. When copies are

requirements, the public records may be provided in this alternate electronic
format for standard fees as specified by the public agency. Any request for a
public record in a form other than the forms described in this section shall be
considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(2)(b))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure

this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the

require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost

for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the public
record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies thereof. However, refusal under this section must be sustained by
clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.

request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific

   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or

General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action. (KRS
61.880, 61.882)

electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and the format conforms
to the requestor's requirements, the public record may be provided in this

§ 37.02 ESTABLISHMENT; DUE DATE; DELINQUENCY AND PENALTY.
   (A)   An ad valorem tax in an amount as established by ordinance of City
Council from time to time on each $100 value of real estate, personal and mixed
property, subject to taxation for the fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending
June 30 of each year, for ordinary municipal purposes to carry on the
government of this city, including police protection, fire protection, repairs
to streets, and furnishing street lighting, is hereby established. By separate
ordinance, the city also levies a waste collection assessment per dwelling unit
which is billed and collected simultaneously with this ad valorem real estate
tax. All of the payment, collection and penalty provisions of this section
shall also apply to the waste collection assessment.
   (B)   All real and personal property taxes levied by the City Council each
year shall be due and payable to the City Treasurer. All real and personal
property taxes shall be due and payable on December 31 of each year. The city
will not accept any partial payments towards its real estate taxes; all such
tax bills must be paid in full.
Payments of real estate taxes shall be actually received by the city by 5:00
p.m. E.S.T. on or before December 31, unless December 31 falls on a Saturday or
Sunday, in which case the tax payment must be received by the city's last
business day of the year, deemed to be the Friday immediately before December
31. Provided however that payments received subsequent to the deadline which
contain valid postmarks stamped by the United States Post Office dated on or
before the due date will be received and honored as timely payments. Anyone
failing to pay the tax by December 29, 2023 shall be deemed delinquent and the
bill shall have added thereto a penalty of 20% of the amount thereof and shall
bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum from January 3, 2024, until paid.
The delinquent taxpayer shall also pay all costs and expenses incidental to any
action taken by the city for collection of the delinquent tax bill, including
court costs and attorney's fees. When a delinquent taxpayer is required to pay
penalty, interest and the city's attorney's fees pursuant to the foregoing, the
charges shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The calculation of interest shall be 12% per annum, calculated on a
monthly compound basis, such that after each calendar month of delinquency, an
additional 1% becomes due.
      (2)   If a real estate tax bill is unpaid when due, the city may engage
its City Attorney to send a letter to the taxpayer, identifying the unpaid tax
bill, stating the amount due and the fact of its delinquency; the fee agreed
upon by the city and the City Attorney for such letters shall be assessed to
the taxpayer.
      (3)   If a real estate tax bill is unpaid when due, the city may engage
its City Attorney to draft and record a statement of lien with the County
Clerk; the fee agreed upon by the city and the City Attorney for such letters
shall be assessed to the taxpayer.
      (4)   If the city is named as a party defendant in any debt collection
action against a taxpayer incident to the city's unpaid tax bill, including
actions for foreclosure of other liens against the subject real estate, the
city may engage its City Attorney to draft and file in said action an answer
and affidavit to set forth the city's claim, protect its lien, and demand
payment of all sums due to the city; the fee agreed upon by the city and the
City Attorney for such letters shall be assessed to the taxpayer.
      (5)   The set amount fees established by the agreement between the city
and the City Attorney are deemed reasonable.
      (6)   If the city engages its City Attorney, or other legal
representation, for collection of real estate taxes on a special basis or
program, other than as above, said fees shall be added to the tax bills for the
sums actually incurred by the city.
   (C)   The city has a lien upon the property assessed under the terms of this
chapter for the taxes levied upon the property under the terms of this chapter
and for all penalties, interest, fees, commissions, charges, and other
expenses, including court costs and attorney's fees, incurred by reason of
delinquency in payment of the tax bill or in the process of collecting it. Such
a lien has priority over all other obligations or liabilities for which the
property is liable.

standards in this Code of Ethics.

§ 38.12 INCOMPATIBLE OFFICES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 165 of the Kentucky Constitution, no officer or
employee of the city may also be a state officer, deputy state officer, member
of the General Assembly, or may fill more than one municipal office at the same
time, whether in the same or a different city.
   (B)   Pursuant to KRS 61.080, no city officer may also hold a county office.
In addition, the statute states that the following city and consolidated local
government offices are incompatible with any other public office:
      (1)   Member of the legislative body of cities of the First Class;
      (2)   Mayor and member of the legislative council of a consolidated local
government; and
      (3)   Mayor and member of the legislative body in cities of the Home Rule
Class.
   (C)   In addition to the constitution and statutory provisions, there are
common law incompatibilities defined by the courts. City officers and
employment positions are deemed incompatible when one office or position of
employment was inherently inconsistent in function with the other. This
incompatibility occurs when there arises an implication that the duties and
responsibilities of both cannot be performed at the same time with a necessary
degree of impartiality and honesty.
   (D)   KRS 61.090 provides that the acceptance of an incompatible office
operates to vacate the first office.

§ 38.13 WITHDRAWAL FROM PARTICIPATION.

public meeting conducted under KRS 61.810 and KRS 61.815.
   (B)   Withdrawal at a meeting requires public announcement, on the record,
of the reason for withdrawal.
(Ord. 09-2024, passed 8-21-24)
§ 38.14 RECEIPT OF GIFTS.

only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or "Go": Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop": Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed

Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a "Yield Right-of-Way"
sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a speed in excess
of 15 miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not apply to vehicles
entering an expressway.
   (G)   Lane lights: When lane lights are installed over any street for the
purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing amber lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from
that lane. Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles shall not move
against them. If flashing amber lights show above a lane, that lane shall be

as the personal direction of a police officer.
Penalty, see § 70.99

device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 91.01 SIDEWALK POLICY AND CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE PLAN.
   (A)   Introduction.
      (1)   This Sidewalk Policy and Construction and Maintenance Plan
("Policy") shall cover the construction of new sidewalks and the repair of
existing sidewalks that are located in the public right-of-way and that have
been dedicated and accepted by the city for public use.
      (2)   It is the goal of the policy to address the following sidewalk
issues, listed in descending order of importance.
         First:      Repairing severely damaged (hazardous) sidewalks.
         Second:   Filling in missing short sections between sidewalks.
         Third:      Filling in large areas without sidewalks.
         Fourth:      Aesthetic considerations.
   (B)   Sidewalk fund. The City Council has approved a capital projects
program fund, which includes an annual budgeted line item earmarked for the
maintenance and construction of sidewalks located in the public right-of-way.
This fund ("the Sidewalk Fund") will be used to purchase materials, equipment,
labor, and professional services necessary to implement the policy.
   (C)   Sidewalk Committee. A Sidewalk Committee is established under this
policy to oversee the policy. The Sidewalk Committee is comprised of the
Council members appointed to the Community Preservation Committee, the City
Administrative Officer, and the Public Works Director. The Committee will meet
periodically, but at least annually, to review the work schedule and make
recommendations for changes and adjustments whenever necessary.
   (D)   Implementation plan. In order to provide for the efficient and orderly
implementation of the policy, the city is divided into six sidewalk districts
(see map attached to Ord. 3-2017).
   (E)   Sidewalk inventory and condition assessment.
      (1)   The Public Works Department shall periodically inventory as many
sidewalks as allowed by time and budget, for the purpose of creating a sidewalk
condition index (the "Index").
      (2)   When inventorying sidewalks, the Public Works Department shall use
the following rating system to compile data to form the Index:
         (a)   "Slight Cracking" denotes a crack that is superficial up to 1/8"
in width and/or vertical displacement less than 1/8". (1 point)
         (b)   "Moderate Cracking" denotes a crack that is between 1/8" and 1/
4" in width and/or slight vertical displacement up to 1/2". (2 points)
         (c)   "Severe Cracking" denotes a crack that is over 1/4" in width
and/or has a vertical displacement of 1/2" to 1". (3 points)
         (d)   "Vertical Separation" denotes a section of sidewalk in which the
vertical separation is greater than 1". (5 points)
   (F)   Prioritization Plan.
      (1)   Each district shall be ranked based upon the results of the
sidewalk inventory. Priority will be determined by the highest point total in
the most recent index.
      (2)   Once the Public Works Department has begun work in a district, it
will continue in that district until all sidewalks have been inspected and the
required repairs and replacements have been made.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the above sentence, the Sidewalk Committee may
consider other factors in determining whether an exception to the general
policy is warranted, on a case-by-case basis. These factors include, but are
not limited to: natural disasters, emergencies, or other extraordinary
circumstances, the volume of pedestrian traffic, proximity to public
transportation boarding and drop off points, and proximity to schools.
   (G)   Criteria for sidewalk repair and replacement. Upon inspection,
sidewalks in the prioritized district shall be repaired and/or replaced if the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   Vertical offset at joints larger than one inch.
      (2)   Intersecting cracks in one panel subject to displacement.
      (3)   Settlement in sidewalk larger than four inches in an eight-foot
span.
      (4)   Rough surface due to deterioration of concrete that is determined
hazardous.
   (H)   Sidewalk specifications.
      (1)   All sidewalk repairs, replacement, and construction shall comply
with the Kenton County Subdivision Regulations. This provision shall apply to
any developer who builds sidewalks in residential and commercial subdivisions.
      (2)   Any sidewalk construction or repair shall be subject to inspection
by the City Public Works Department for compliance with the abovementioned
standards or quality of material and workmanship.
   (I)   Trees and tree roots in the vicinity of sidewalks. In certain
locations trees have been planted in close proximity to sidewalks. Roots of
such trees may have caused severe damage to sidewalks, the repair of which may
require the cutting of these roots. In the event a sidewalk cannot be repaired
or rendered compliant without the removal of the tree, the tree shall be
removed. If such a tree is in the right-of-way, the sidewalk fund shall pay for
the removal. If the tree is on private property, the property owner shall be
responsible for the removal.
   (J)   Damage to sidewalks due to private construction activity or individual
acts. If a private construction activity or individual act causes damage to a
public sidewalk, the party causing the damage shall be responsible for
repairing and/or replacing the damaged sidewalk.
   (K)   Repair or replacement of sidewalks by others. If a resident or group
of residents choose to repair or replace a damaged sidewalk that meets the
replacement criteria of division (G) above, before the scheduled repair or
replacement, the sidewalk program may pay for the concrete used to complete
such work, provided yearly budgeted funds are available. A resident making such
a request shall employ a bonded contractor or provide surety to the city in the
amount of $1,000. The resident or contractor performing such work must obtain
all proper permits. Such work will be subject to inspection by the Public Works
Department.
   (L)   Utilities. Utility companies shall comply with the provisions of their
franchise agreement with the city.
   (M)   Construction of sidewalk by others. If a resident or a group of
residents or a private or public entity chooses to construct a sidewalk in the
right-of-way where none exists, the sidewalk program may pay for the concrete
used to complete such work provided yearly budgeted funds are available. A
resident making such a request shall employ a bonded contractor or provide
surety to the city in the amount of $1,000. The resident or contractor
performing such work must obtain all proper permits. Such work will be subject
to inspection by the Public Works Department.
   (N)   Sidewalk program management and construction.
      (1)   The policy shall be managed by the city Public Works Department.
The City Council, City Administrator, and Community Preservation Committee
shall provide guidance in the implementation of the policy.
      (2)   In order to obtain the most efficient use of the sidewalk fund, the
Public Works Department may perform the sidewalk repairs, replacement and
construction of sidewalks. If, due to heavy workload, the Public Works
Department cannot perform the work in a timely manner, then this work may be
bid and awarded to a private contractor.
   (O)   Repair or replacement of sidewalks as part of city road construction
projects. The City Council has approved a capital projects program fund, which
includes an annual budgeted line item earmarked for the maintenance, repair,
and replacement of city streets (the "Street Repair Program"). If a sidewalk is
repaired or replaced in conjunction with a project under the street repair
program, the sidewalk fund shall cover the costs associated with the repair or
replacement of sidewalk.
   (P)   Requests for exceptions and appeals. A Fort Wright resident may
request an exception to the policy. The resident's request must identify an
exception listed in division (F)(1) above. The Sidewalk Committee's decision
with respect to the resident's request shall be final.

cover up, or in any form obliterate that strip of land between the street and
the sidewalk commonly known as "tree lawn" within the confines of the city,
excepting the planting of grass or trees or as otherwise provided in this
section.
   (B)   The City Council may in its discretion and in conformity with the
general intent of this section, grant approval by written permission for
blacktopping, concreting, macadamizing, or other use of the strip of land
commonly referred to as the "tree lawn." This approval is to be granted by the
City Council after first consideration is given to maintaining the uniformity,

§ 93.31 SMOKE DETECTORS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Subject to such exceptions and conditions for compliance as stated
herein, six months after the effective date of this subchapter, smoke detectors
shall be required in all dwellings privately owned or rented for occupancy. It
shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new or existing occupied
dwelling unit to install smoke detectors in each dwelling unit as hereinafter
provided. The smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing visible or invisible
particles of combustion and providing a suitable audible (or visual for the
deaf or hearing-impaired) alarm.
   (B)   This subchapter shall apply to any and all dwellings or dwelling
units, new or existing, which do not fall under the jurisdiction of the
currently adopted Kentucky Building Code or the currently adopted Life Safety
Code (LSC 101).
(Ord. -1985, passed - -85)
Penalty, see § 93.99
§ 93.32 TYPE AND PLACEMENT.
   (A)   In order to comply with this subchapter, only ionization or
photoelectric type detectors approved by a nationally-recognized testing
laboratory shall be installed. As an alternative to self-contained smoke
detectors, under certain limited conditions (i.e., battery-powered smoke
detectors), an approved fire detection system or a combination thereof may be
installed. The City Fire Inspector may subjectively, and on a case-by-case
basis, approve each and every alternative system in written form.
   (B)   Smoke detectors in new residential dwellings shall be wired directly
(hard wired) to the building's power supply. In existing buildings, it is
preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power supply; however,
the detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery or operated by an
electrical plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device,
provided that the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the main
power supply.
   (C)   Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with applicable N.F.P.A.
Standards (see § 93.34). Detectors may be ceiling or wall mounted, provided
that if wall mounted they shall be within 12 inches, but not closer than six
inches, of the ceiling.
   (D)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area. A sleeping area is defined as the area or areas of the dwelling
unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping rooms) are located. Where bedrooms or
rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other used areas (such as
kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section. In a
dwelling unit which contains a well-defined sleeping room separated from the
other activity areas of the same unit, the detector shall be located in the
corridor within the unit or interior area giving direct access to the rooms
used for sleeping purposes. Where sleeping areas are separated or where a
single smoke detector will not adequately service all sleeping areas, there
shall be smoke detectors installed adjacent to each sleeping area.
   (E)   In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally located on the
ceiling.
   (F)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any rooming
unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each
dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally located
common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately service all sleeping
areas.
(Ord. -1985, passed - -85)
Penalty, see § 93.99
§ 93.33 INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The owner of the dwelling shall be responsible for supplying and
installing in an operable condition the required detectors and for providing
maintenance and testing in an owner- occupied residence; or for providing the
manufacturer's maintenance and testing instructions to a tenant in the case of
rental property.
   (B)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for maintenance and
testing of detectors, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, which are
located in common areas or detectors in rooming units where the tenant usually
has short periods of occupancy (hotels, motels, rooming or tourist homes).
   (C)   The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and testing the
detector, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, which are within
his exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant shall be
responsible for notifying, in writing, the owner when a detector becomes
inoperable, whereafter the owner has ten days in which to repair or replace in
operable condition the detector. In the battery-operated type of detector,
battery replacement shall be the responsibility of the tenant.
   (D)   At every change of tenancy, it shall be the duty of the owner to test
and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition prior to re-renting the unit.
   (E)   At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by or
incidental to a sale, lease or sub-lease of the unit, it shall be the duty of
the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor or sub-lessor, as the case may
be) to provide, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke detectors
as required by this section (or other applicable laws) are installed and in
proper working condition. Failure to comply with this division shall be
punishable as set forth herein; provided, however, that this division shall not
be construed to violate or render void any contract, lease, or sub-lease
subject hereto.
   (F)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly connected
(permanently wired) to the electrical system of a structure without the proper
electrical certification.
(Ord. -1985, passed - -85)
Penalty, see § 93.99
§ 93.34 SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS.
   This subchapter is intended to be used with, and supplemented by, the
applicable provisions of the National Fire Protection Standards Nos. 72-E and
74 (current edition) which are hereby incorporated herein; however, if there
shall be any conflict between this subchapter and the supplemental standards,
this subchapter and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall
prevail. All amendments to or changes in N.F.P.A. Nos. 72-E and 74 shall be
adopted and made part thereof without further reference.
(Ord. -1985, passed - -85)
§ 93.35 ENFORCEMENT.

employees, and volunteers of the Fire Department of the city; and all other
officers, employees, and the city all information relevant thereto acquired by
them in the course and scope of their employment or association with the city.
No licenses, permits, or certificates of any kind or nature shall be issued on
behalf of the city in regard to the condition of or any activity within any
dwelling unit unless smoke detectors have been installed and located therein
according to the requirements and specifications hereof.
(Ord. -1985, passed - -85)
§ 93.36 CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   All owners of dwellings, dwelling units, or rooming units shall,
within six months of the effective date of this subchapter, certify in writing
on a form to be provided by the Fire Department, to the Chief of the Fire
Department, compliance with this subchapter. The failure of any owner to so
certify compliance shall give rise to a presumption of noncompliance and shall
be grounds for citing the owner under the penalty section hereof.
   (B)   The presumption of noncompliance may be rebutted by evidence
established during an inspection as provided in § 93.99.
(Ord. -1985, passed - -85)

93.36 is $250. The penalty for noncompliance is automatically waived if the
dwelling unit is brought into compliance with §§
93.30 through
93.36 within 30 days of the original violation. The property owner must request
an inspection from the Fire Department to verify compliance and have the waiver
provision applied. Continued failure to comply may result in a maximum penalty

substantial covering in such manner that the same cannot fall or be blown from
such vehicle.
   (B)   No person shall operate on any street, alley, or other public place a
vehicle with mud, dirt, sticky substances, litter, or foreign matter on its
wheels or other parts, if such operation results in the depositing or tracking

other public place. No person being the owner of real property or a prime
contractor in charge of a construction site shall maintain such property or

restored within 12 hours, the City Administrator is authorized to cause such
mud, dirt, substances, litter, or foreign matter to be cleaned from such street
and to charge the cost thereof to the person or persons responsible. The cost
of cleaning shall be collected by civil suit. The term "responsible person" as
used in this section shall mean the driver of the vehicle which deposited or
tracked the mud, dirt, substances, litter, or foreign matter on the street, or
the driver's employer, or the owner of the real property or prime contractor in
charge of a construction site from where the deposited or tracked mud, dirt,

mud, dirt, sticky substances, litter, or foreign matter originated and to which
the offending vehicle was proceeding to secure the costs of removing same and
cleaning the street, alley, or other public place pursuant to this section, and
further to secure the expenses incurred by the city in the collection of the
aforesaid costs. Such lien may be enforced by an action for the foreclosure
thereof.

BUSINESS TAXATION
§ 110.25 LEVY AND IMPOSITION.
   For the purpose of providing funds for the general operating expenses of the
city and the municipal services and functions provided thereby, and subject to
the provisions of KRS 67.750 through 67.795, and except as provided in §
110.28, an occupational license fee is hereby levied and imposed upon everybody
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other businesses in
the city, for the privilege of that engagement.
(Ord. 10-07, passed 12-05-07)
§ 110.26 RATE.
   The occupational license fee that is levied and imposed by this chapter is
at the rate of:
   (A)   Employees. Ninety-nine one-hundredths percent (0.99%) of all
compensation earned by an employee for labor, work or services provided in the
city.
   (B)   Those not employees. Seven and one-half one-hundredths percent
(0.075%) of the taxable gross receipts of everybody, other than employees,
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business in

   (C)   The occupational license fee enacted herein will apply only to taxable

§ 110.27 APPORTIONMENT OF GROSS RECEIPTS.
   (A)   Pursuant to the authority of KRS 67.753(4), it is hereby determined
that the apportionment provisions of KRS 67.753 do not fairly represent the
extent of the engagement in the city of those, other than employees, who are
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business both
within and outside of the city; and
   (B)   Accordingly, the following described property factor is hereby added
to the payroll factor and the sales factor provided in KRS 67.753 for the
apportionment of the gross receipts of those, other than employees, who are
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business both
within and outside of the city.
      (1)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or
rented and used in the city during the computation period, and the denominator
of which is the average value of all of the taxpayer's real and tangible
personal property owned or rented and used anywhere during the computation
period. In the determination of the property factor:
         (a)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.
Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight (8) times the net annual
rental rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any
annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub-rentals.
         (b)   The average value of property shall be determined by averaging
the values at the beginning and ending of the computation period, but the City
Administrative Officer may require the averaging of monthly values during the
computation period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value
of the taxpayer's property.
      (2)   The proportion of the total gross receipts everywhere of those,
other than employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business both within and outside of the city that are
subject to the occupational license fee established by this chapter, shall be
determined by multiplying the total gross receipts thereof everywhere by the
quotient of the total of the payroll factor and the sales factor described in
KRS 67.753(2) and (3), and the property factor described in division (1), that
the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the city
during the tax period, divided by the total number of those factors that the
franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the city
during the tax period . The total number of those factors that the franchise,
trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the city during the tax
period will always be either 1, 2 or 3. For example, if the franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business:
         (a)   Had only the sales revenue factor in the city, during the tax
period, without either the property factor or the payroll factor in the city,
the total number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business had in the city during the tax period would be 1;
or
         (b) Had both the sales revenue factor and the payroll factor in the
city, during the tax period, without the property factor in the city, the total
number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business had in the city during the tax period would be 2; or
         (c)   Had the sales revenue factor, and the payroll factor, and the
property factor in the city, during the tax period, the total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the city during the tax period would be 3.
(Ord. 10-07, passed 12-05-07)
§ 110.28 EXEMPTIONS.

exempt such ordained minister of religion from the necessity of paying a
license fee for work done or services performed in the city in activities not
connected with his regular duties as a minister of religion.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean the employees of
churches, religious congregations, or religious societies of all creeds (except
duly ordained ministers) shall be relieved from the payment of any occupational
license fee in compliance with all regulations established by the License
Inspector with respect to making returns and payment of the fees.
