§ 2.36.020 PROCEDURES.
   The following procedures shall be followed by persons making a request to
inspect public records and by the official custodian and/or custodians of those
public records.
   (A)   Initial request with immediate inspection.
      (1)   As defined in §
2.36.010, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
2.36.030, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of a
governmental unit of the city shall make a request and/or complete a written
application for such records at the office of the official custodian during
regular office hours, Monday through Friday of each week, except during legal
holidays.
      (2)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in
compliance with the Open Records Law being KRS 61.870 through 61.884 and that
the requested records are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver
such records for inspection. Suitable facilities shall be made available for
the inspection, and no person shall remove original copies of public records
from the offices of any public agency without the written permission of the
official custodian of the record.
      (3)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all written public records. When written copies
are requested, the custodian may require a written request and advance payment
of the prescribed fee as defined in §
2.36.010.
   (B)   Referral to proper custodian. If the Mayor or Clerk of the city does
not have custody or control of the public record or records requested, the
Mayor or Clerk shall so notify the applicant and shall furnish the name of
location of the custodian of the public record, if such facts are known by the
Mayor or Clerk.
   (C)   Public records not immediately available. If the public records are in
active use, in storage, or not otherwise available, the official custodian
shall immediately so notify the applicant and shall designate a place, time,
and date for inspection of the public record, not to exceed three days
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from receipt of the
application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is given for further
delay as well as the place, time, and earliest date on which the public record
will be available for inspection and/or duplication.
   (D)   Refusal; when authorized; sustenance. If the application places an
unreasonable burden in producing voluminous public records or if the custodian
has reason to believe that repeated requests are intended to disrupt other
essential functions of the public agency, the official custodian may refuse to
permit inspection of the public records; however, refusal under this chapter
must be sustained in writing by clear and convincing evidence and placed in the
appropriate files.
   (E)   Time limitation; denial of inspection.
      (1)   The city, by the official custodian or his or her designee, upon
any request for records made under this order, shall determine within three
days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the receipt of
any such request whether to comply with the request and shall notify in writing
the person making the request, within the three-day period, of its decision.
Any response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record shall
include a statement of the specific exception authorizing the withholding of
the record and a brief explanation of how the exception applies to the record
withheld. The response shall be issued by the official custodian, or under his
or her authority; and it shall constitute final action of the agency of the
city.
      (2)   A copy of the written response denying inspection of a public
record shall be forwarded immediately by the city to the Attorney General of
the commonwealth. Upon the Attorney General’s request, the agency of the city
will provide additional documentation.
      (3)   If, upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney
General reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding in whole or
in part, the request for inspection, the agency of the city may institute
proceedings within 30 days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the County
Circuit Court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request or if
the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General’s opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
the County Circuit Court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such
action.
   (F)   Concealment or destruction of records; access to records.
      (1)   No official of the city shall wilfully conceal or destroy any
record with the intent to violate the provision of the law or this order.
      (2)   Any person shall have access to any public record relating to him
or her or in which he or she is mentioned by name and upon presentation of
appropriate identification, subject to the provisions of §
2.36.030.
(Ord. 1992-3, passed - -1992)
§ 2.36.030 EXCLUSIONS.
   The following public records are excluded from the application of the
provisions herein, and these records and regulations shall be subject to
inspection only upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction:
   (A)   Public records containing information of a personal nature where the
public disclosure thereof would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy. Examples include acquisition, relocation, and rehabilitation
of files on families disclosing income or other personal data;
   (B)   (1)   Records confidentially disclosed to any agency of the city and
compiled and maintained for scientific research and regulation of commercial
enterprise, including mineral exploration records, nonpatented secret
commercially-valuable plans, appliances, formulae, or processes which are used
for the making, preparing, compounding, treating, or processing of articles or
materials which are trade commodities obtained from a person and which are
generally recognized as confidential, or for the grant or review of a license
to do business, and if openly disclosed would permit an unfair advantage to
competitors of the subject’s enterprise; and
      (2)   This exemption shall not, however, apply to records the disclosure
or publication of which is directed by the common laws or statutes of the

§ 3.16.010 METHODS OF PROCUREMENT.
   Procurement shall be made by one of the following methods.
   (A)   Small purchases.
      (1)   Purchases of supplies, equipment, and services that cost over $200,
but less than $20,000, will require written estimates, but no legal
advertisement is required. The city will solicit written responses from at
least three vendors, and if no such responses are available, a statement
explaining the procurement will be prepared and filed.
      (2)   Purchases that cost between $50 and $200 require three over-the-
telephone quotations of rate, price, and the like. A memorandum will be
prepared setting forth the date of the calls were made, parties contacted, and
prices obtained. For purchases of less than $50, efforts will be made to get
the lowest and best price, but written records of such efforts are not
necessary.
   (B)   Competitive sealed bids.
      (1)   Bidding will be employed when detailed specifications for the goods
or services to be procured can be prepared and the primary basis for award is
cost. When the cost of a contract, lease, or other agreement for materials,
supplies, equipment, or contractual services other than those personal or
professional exceeds $20,000, an invitation for bids (IFB) notice will
generally be prepared. This notice will be published at least once in at least
one official newspaper of general circulation within the community and either
distribute the IFB to qualified contractors or publish the notice in a
regionally circulated newspaper. This newspaper notice will appear not less
than seven days and not more than 21 days before the due date for bid
proposals. The city may also solicit sealed bids from responsible prospective
suppliers by sending them a copy of such notice.
      (2)   The IFB will include a general description of the goods or services
to be procured, the bid deposit and bond performance required (if applicable),
the location where bid forms and specifications may be secured, the time and
place for opening bids, and whether the bid award will be made on the basis of
the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated price. If the lowest evaluated
price is used, the measurable criteria to be utilized must be stated in the
IFB. The newspaper notice must also contain language that calls to the
attention of bidders all applicable requirements that must be complied with
such as § 3 of the 1968 Housing Act being 42 U.S.C. § 3603, § 109 of the 1974
Housing and Community Development Act being 42 U.S.C. § 5309, the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 being 42 U.S.C. §§ 1404a et seq., Exec. Order 11246, and the Davis-
Bacon Act being 40 U.S.C. §§ 276a to 276a-5.
      (3)   (a)   In addition to price, the following are bid evaluation
criteria which may be used with varying weight dependent upon the particular
procurement to be made.
         (b)   The criteria and their weights will be established by the IFB:
            1.   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience,
and efficiency of the contractor;
            2.   The ability of the vendor to provide the material or service
promptly or within the time specified, without delay or interference;
            3.   The quality of performance by the vendor on previous
contracts, orders, or services; and
            4.   The ability of the vendor to provide future maintenance and
service for all equipment purchased from the vendor.
      (4)   The criteria upon which a bid will be awarded will be established
by a review committee which will include, if possible, persons with applicable
technical skills. The city will appoint the reviewers, making certain that
these individuals have no potential conflicts of interest with the firms or
individuals under review. The committee will have no less than three members.
The committee will maintain written records of its deliberations, including an
evaluation of each bid received.
      (5)   Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place stated
in the IFBs. The city will tabulate the bids at the time of bid opening. The
results of the tabulation and the bid documents will be evaluated by the review
committee, which will make recommendations to the city. The city will make the
decision as to which the contract shall be awarded. After the city makes the
bid award, a contract will be prepared for execution by the successful bidder.
After the contract is signed, all bid deposits will be returned to all
unsuccessful bidders.
      (6)   The city may cancel an invitation for bid or reject all bids if it
is determined in writing that such is in the best interests of the city. The
city may allow a vendor to withdraw a bid if requested at any time prior to the
bid opening. Bids received after the time set for bid opening shall be returned
to the vendor unopened.
   (C)   Competitive negotiation.
      (1)   (a)   The city will utilize competitive negotiations, regardless of
contract amount, upon a written determination that:
            1.   Specifications cannot be made specific enough to permit the
award of a bid on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest
evaluated bid price (in other words, bidding is not feasible); and
            2.   The services to be procured are professional or personal in
nature.
         (b)   With the exception of procurement of certain professional
services (principally engineering services), competitive negotiations will
proceed as follows.
            1.   Proposals will be solicited through newspaper advertisement;
additionally, a request for proposal (RFP) may be prepared and mailed to
qualified vendors. The newspaper advertisement must be published at least seven
days and not more than 21 days before the date for receipt of the proposals.
The RFP will describe services needed and identify the factors to be considered
in the evaluation of proposals and the relative weights assigned to each
selection factor. The RFP will also state where further details regarding the
RFP may be obtained. The RFP will call attention to the same regulations
discussed in the bidding process. Requests for proposals will always include
cost as a selection factor except for engineering services.
            2.   Awards must be made to the offeror whose proposal is
determined in writing by a review committee to be the most advantageous to the
city. Evaluations must be based on the factors set forth in the request for
proposal and a written evaluation of each response prepared. The review
committee may contact the firms regarding their proposals for the purpose of
clarification and record in writing the nature of the clarification. If it is
determined that no acceptable proposal has been submitted, all proposals may be
rejected. New proposals may be solicited on the same or revised terms or the
procurement may be abandoned.
      (2)   For the procurement of certain professional services, an
alternative to RFPs may be used. The city may publish a request for
qualifications (RFQ). RFQs are handled in a similar method to RFPs with the
exception that cost is not a factor in the initial evaluation. A review
committee will evaluate the responses and rank them by comparative
qualifications. The highest scoring person or firm will be contacted and the
selection committee will negotiate cost. If the committee is unable to
negotiate a satisfactory cost arrangement, the second highest scoring person or
firm will be invited to negotiate. The committee will maintain a written record
of all such negotiations.
   (D)   Non-competitive negotiations.
      (1)   Non-competitive negotiations may be used for procurements in excess
of $20,000 when bidding or competitive negotiations are not feasible.
      (2)   The city may purchase goods and services through non-competitive
negotiations when it is determined in writing by the city that competitive
negotiation or bidding is not feasible and that:
         (a)   An emergency exists which will cause public harm as a result of
the delay caused by following competitive purchasing procedures;
         (b)   The product or service can be obtained only from one source;
         (c)   The contract is for the purchase of perishable items purchased
on a weekly or more frequent basis;
         (d)   Only one satisfactory proposal is received through RFP or RFQ;
and
         (e)   The state has authorized the particular type of non-competitive
negotiation (example - the procurement of services by an area development
district).
      (3)   Procurement by non-competitive negotiation requires the strictest
attention to the observation of impartiality toward all suppliers. The
commonwealth must approve all procurements by non-competitive negotiation when
only one supplier is involved or only one bid or response to an RFP/RPQ is
received.
   (E)   The City of Olive Hill, by and through the City Council hereby adopts
the Kentucky Model Procurement Code as set forth in KRS 45A.343 through
45A.460, along with any applicable amendments which the Kentucky General
Assembly may adopt, said code to be incorporated in full herein by reference.
Said adopted Code is to be made available to the public and located in the City
Clerk's Office.

§ 3.16.020 CONTRACTS.
   (A)   Generally, all procurement in excess of $200 will be memorialized and
supported by a written contract. Where it is infeasible or impractical to
prepare a contract, a written finding to this effect will be prepared and some
form of documentation regarding the transaction will also be prepared.
   (B)   The contractual provisions required by “the common rule” will be
included in all contracts.

purchase orders, invoices, RFP/RFQ data, and bid materials) will be retained
and filed in an appropriate manner. Where feasible, source documents pertinent
to each individual procurement shall be separately filed and maintained. Where
it is infeasible to maintain individual procurement files, source documents
will be filed and maintained in a reasonable manner (examples include
chronologically, by vendor, by type of procurement, and the like).
   (B)   Whatever form of documentation and filing is employed, the purpose of
this section is to ensure that a clear and consistent audit trail is
established. At a minimum, source document data must be sufficient to establish
the basis for selection, basis for cost (including the issue of reasonableness
of cost), and basis for payment.

   (C)   A list of locally-owned, minority-owned, female-owned and small
businesses and also minority businesses located within the trade region shall
be maintained and utilized when issuing IFBs, RFPs, and RFQs. This list shall
also be consulted when making small purchases.

members, or an ________ organization which employs or intends to employ any of
the above has a financial or other interest in any of the competing firms.
   (B)   Acceptance of gratitude. No elected official, employee, or designated
agent of the city shall solicit or accept gratuities, favors, or anything of
monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, subcontractors, or
potential subcontractors.

   (A)   Any elected official, employee, or designated agent of the city who

to civil suit by the citizens of the city without the legal protection of the
city. Furthermore, such a violation of these procurement standards is grounds
for dismissal by the city.

   (B)   The functions of the Administrator shall be the same with respect to
city licenses and regulations as the functions of the Commonwealth Alcoholic

regulations, except that no amendment to these regulations proposed by the

beverage control, or than regulations of the ABC Board.

coordinated with the applicant’s quarterly regulatory fee filings.

God, casualty, death, the acquisition of the premises by any federal, state,
city or other governmental agency under power of eminent domain, whether
acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of
landlord to renew an existing lease; provided, however that prior to the
expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to the
Administrator a verified statement setting forth the fact that the licensee is
unable to continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set forth
herein, and the Administrator may grant an extension of the dormancy with the
license continuing to remain in effect during the license period or until same
is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no business
is transacted during said period; provided, in addition, however, that no such
license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted there under
within 12 months from the date of notice to the Administrator.
         (b)   Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the Administrator deems appropriate in the exercise of his or
her sound discretion.

under this section must possess a city issued permit, be observant of and
attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers,
other motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. All persons who operate or ride

   (C)   Water taps and connections.
      (1)   Whenever the city determines it to be feasible to provide water
service to a customer, the city shall install, maintain, and operate a main
distribution pipeline or lines from the system’s source of water supply and
shall further install and maintain, at the city’s expense, such portion(s) of
the necessary water service lines as may be needed to bring water from a water
main to the lot or easement line of a customer; provided, however, that if the
necessary water service line from the water main to the water meter of a
customer is unusually long, as determined by the manager within guidelines
fixed by the city, the customer may be required to pay a portion of the cost of
such service line.
      (2)   The expense borne by the city in any event shall include the
necessary tap, fittings, and shutoff valve, which items shall belong to the

of this section and to such further rules and regulations as may be prescribed
by the city; provided, however, that should a customer sell or dispose of a
portion of his or her property or subdivide the same, he or she or the new
owner of each such new tract may not demand water and taps without paying
connection fees for each such tract to be served.
      (2)   In the event that the total water supply shall be insufficient to
meet all the needs of the customers, or in the event there is a shortage of
water, the city or its manager may prorate the water available among the
various customers on such basis as is deemed equitable by the city or its
manager, and may also prescribe a schedule of hours covering use of water and
require adherence thereto or prohibit the use of water for specified purposes
for such appropriate period of time as may be necessary under the
circumstances.

WATER RATIONING
§ 13.08.100 WATER RATIONING GENERALLY.

of rationing for equitable distribution of critically short water supplies.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to interfere with common law
riparian or statutory water rights.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ALLOTMENT. The maximum quantity of water allowed for each customer over
any applicable period as established in the provisions of this section.
      CUSTOMER. Any person using water for any purpose from the city’s water
distribution system and for which either a regular charge is made or, in the
case of bulk sales, a cash charge is made at the site of delivery.
      EXCESS USE. The usage of water by a customer in excess of the water
allotment provided under the provisions of this section for the customer, over
any applicable period.
      NONRESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER. Commercial, industrial, institutional, public,
and all other such users, with the exception of hospitals and health care
facilities.
      RATIONING. Procedures established to provide for the equitable
distribution of critically-limited water supplies, in order to balance demand
and limited available supplies, and to assure that sufficient water is
available to preserve public health and safety.
      RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER. Any customer who receives water service for a
single- or multi-family dwelling unit. The term RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER does not
include educational or other institutions, hotels, motels, or similar
commercial establishments.
      SERVICE INTERRUPTION. The temporary suspension of water supply, or
reduction of pressure below that required for adequate supply, to any customer,
portion of water supply, or entire system.
      WATER SUPPLIES. Water available to the City of Olive Hill for treatment
by virtue of its water rights or withdrawal permit or any treated water
introduced by the city into its water distribution system, including water
offered for sale.
   (C)   Declaration of rationing. Whenever the governing body of the city
finds a need to provide for the equitable distribution of critically limited
water supplies, in order to balance demand and limited available supplies, and
to assure that sufficient water is available to preserve public health and
safety, it shall be empowered to declare by resolution the adoption of
mandatory rationing.
   (D)   Objectives of rationing.
      (1)   It is imperative that water customers achieve an immediate further
reduction in water use in order to extend existing water supplies and, at the
same time, assure that sufficient water is available to preserve the public
health and sanitation and to provide fire protection service.
      (2)   Should shortages continue, further reductions in usage may be
required. The additional usage reduction in the rationed area must be a valid
and attainable goal reflective of the conditions which currently exist.
      (3)   The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage and for
equal sacrifice on the part of each water customer. The success of this section
depends on the cooperation of all water customers in the emergency area.
   (E)   Water use rationing and residential customers.
      (1)   Metered residential water customers and allotments.
         (a)   The number of permanent residents in each dwelling unit
(household) will determine the amount of water that each household will be
allowed.
         (b)   Each dwelling unit (household) shall be allotted 40 gallons per
day for each resident of the household. Households with only one permanent
resident will have a daily allotment of 55 gallons.
         (c)   1.   Residential water customers are required to provide city
and utility personnel with reasonable access to read meters as necessary to
this rationing declaration.
            2.   Where access is not readily available, all reasonable efforts
to contact customers in order to arrange for access to read meters shall be
made.
            3.   In the event a water customer does not allow entry to read the
meter after reasonable efforts to arrange for such access, the dwelling unit
(household) allotment will be reduced to 55 gallons per day; 40 gallons for
household with only one permanent resident.
         (d)   1.   Where the residential water allotment provided under this
division (E)(1) would create an extraordinary hardship, as in the case of
special health-related requirements, the water customer may apply to the city
for an exemption or variance from these requirements. If it is found that the
allotment provided in this section would impose an extraordinary hardship, a
revised allotment for the particular customer may be established; or
            2.   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an
exemption or variance may file a complaint with the city’s governing body in
accordance with the city’s normal administrative procedures.
      (2)   Non-metered residential water customers and allotments.
         (a)   In order to effectively implement and monitor the residential
water conservation effort, a water allotment shall be established for the
entire water system based on 40 gallons per day per capita served or 50% of the
water used by the entire system during the month of August, 1998.
         (b)   The city and the utility will establish a communication system
with the customers through public media to inform them of the possible
conservation measures that customers may employ, the system allotment, and a
regularly scheduled report of whether the usage was within the allotment.
      (3)   Metered and non-metered residential customers of the same water
supply system. Where a water supply system serves both metered and non-metered
residential customers, the allotments and procedures provided under both in
divisions (E)(1) and (E)(2) above shall be applied, as appropriate.
   (F)   Water use rationing for nonresidential water customers.
      (1)   Nonresidential water customers shall further reduce their water
usage to 50% of use levels during the month of August, 1998.
      (2)   It is the primary responsibility of each nonresidential water
customer to meet its mandated water use reduction goal in whatever manner
possible.
      (3)   The city will establish a water allotment for each nonresidential
water customer, based upon a required further reduction of water usage from the
rate of water used by the customer in effect on August 31, 1998, or the last
recorded use level if no meter readings record the rate of the customer’s use
on August 31, 1998.
      (4)   Each nonresidential water customer shall provide access to city
personnel for purposes of meter reading and monitoring of compliance with this
section. All reasonable efforts will be made to contact customers to arrange
for access.
      (5)   (a)   If the mandated further reduction in water usage cannot be
obtained without imposing an extraordinary hardship which threatens health and
safety, the nonresidential customer may apply to the city for a variance. For
these purposes EXTRAORDINARY HARDSHIP means a permanent damage to property or
economic loss which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne by
other water users subject to this section. If the further reduction would cause
an extraordinary hardship or threaten health or safety, a variance may be
granted and a revised water use reduction requirement for the particular
customer may be established.
         (b)   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such a variance
rendered may file a complaint with the city’s governing body in accordance with
established procedures.
      (6)   The city’s normal administrative procedure.
   (G)   Water use rationing for hospitals and health care facilities.
      (1)   Hospitals and health care facilities shall comply with all
restrictions imposed on residential and nonresidential water customers as may
be applicable to each individual institution, to the extent compliance will not
endanger the health of the patients or residents of the institution.
      (2)   Each hospital or health care facility shall survey its water usage
patterns and requirements and implement such additional conservation measures
as may be possible without endangering the health of its patients or residents
to achieve a further reduction in the institution’s water usage.
      (3)   The city will provide each hospital and health care facility with
suggested means to reduce usage levels.
   (H)   Enforcement of water rationing.
      (1)   The city, or its water utility, will have primary responsibility
for monitoring of compliance with the water rationing ordinance.
      (2)   The following provisions shall govern the implementation of service
interruptions.
         (a)   In order to effectuate compliance with this section, the city is
hereby authorized and required to plan and implement service interruptions to
all or part of its water supply system, as may be deemed appropriate, when any
and/or all of the following conditions are determined to exist:
            1.   The mandated reduction in system-wide usage has not been
achieved;
            2.   The mandated reduction in system-wide water usage has been
achieved, but has failed to have a significant impact in extending limited
water supplies; and/or
            3.   Service interruptions are necessary in order to further extend
limited and/or dwindling water supplies.
         (b)   1.   In the event it is determined that service interruptions
are necessary, the city shall notify its customers that a planned service
interruption is to be imposed. This shall be done through the public media
(newspapers, radio, and television) and at least one day prior to the service
interruptions.
            2.   Such notice shall:
               a.   State the day or days when the planned service
interruptions will occur;
               b.   State the time(s) when such planned service interruptions
will commence, and the time(s) such interruptions will cease;
               c.   State whether the planned service interruptions are to be
imposed on the entire system, or part thereof, and, if only part(s) of the
system will experience planned service interruptions, identify geographic
boundaries within which such interruptions will occur; and
               d.   Advise all customers within the area affected by planned
service interruptions how to treat any water received from the system, for
human consumption, during the period(s) of such interruptions and for such
additional time as may be necessary until full pressure is restored to the
system.
         (c)   If a planned service interruption is imposed as authorized and
required by this section, it must provide for the continued delivery of water
to health care facilities within the area(s) affected by such interruptions, by
means of any adequate, alternative delivery measures that may be necessary.
         (d)   If a planned service interruption is implemented, it must make
provision, by any means possible, for the continued delivery of such water as
may be necessary for the proper operation of sewage collection, treatment, and
disposal systems and facilities.
      (3)   Any residential or nonresidential water customer who exceeds the
allotments established pursuant to this water rationing will be subject to the
following excess use charges.
         (a)   Excess use charges will be collected based on the amount by
which a customer’s use exceeds the water allotments established pursuant to the
local water rationing declaration, computed in accordance with the following
schedule.
 
Excess Usage Per Month                 Charge For Excess
First 2,000 gallons or portion thereof $15 per 1,000 gallons or portion thereof
Each 1,000 gallons or portion thereof, $30
thereafter
 
         (b)   Any monies collected through excess-use charges shall not be
accounted for as income, but shall be placed in reserve account that is
dedicated to addressing water shortage problems and water conservation
initiatives.
      (4)   In addition to the excess-use charge, noncompliance with the water
rationing provisions of this section will result in the following.
         (a)   For the first excess use, a warning of possible discontinuation
shall be issued to the customer.
         (b)   For the second or subsequent excess use, service to the customer
may be interrupted or shut off for a period not to exceed 48 hours, or, if the
customer provides access, a flow restrictor may be installed in the customer’s
service line for the duration of the emergency. The cost incurred to interrupt
or shut off and reinstate service, or to install and remove a flow restrictor,
shall be assessed to the water customer.
      (5)   Meter reading schedules are authorized to be altered to assure
adequate monitoring of compliance with this section.
      (6)   Any customer or other person aggrieved by a decision or action
imposing an excess-use charge or other remedy for noncompliance with the
requirements of this section may proceed in accordance with the following
provision: the city shall adopt procedures which provide an opportunity for the
customer or aggrieved party to rebut the finding of a violation, or provide
evidence of circumstances beyond the customer’s control which resulted in the
violation. A record of evidence regarding disputed violations shall be kept,
and written notice of the city’s final decision and action in such cases shall
be provided to the customer or aggrieved party.

13.16.030   Gas line distribution system; depth
   
13.16.040   Gas line distribution system; distributing; required notification
§ 13.16.010 RATES; DESIGNATION.
   (A)   Minimum bills for gas service. The customer charge shown below will be
charged to each property owner or tenant who has a gas meter located on the
property. This minimum charge will be assessed on each account even if no gas
was used during the billing period. There are costs associated with having gas
available for use, such as meter reading, salaries, debt, maintenance of lines,
depreciation, materials and supplies and insurance that the city must recover.
   (B)   Calculation of rates.
      (1)   The monthly rates are determined based on two separate components,
the cost of purchased gas and the operation and maintenance expenses. The price
of purchased gas changes each month and the city must be able to pass the gas
costs on to its customers in a timely manner. Therefore, each time the cost of
gas is increased or decreased to the city from its supplier, the schedule of
gas rates as heretofore set out shall be adjusted by the Utility Department.
The city will not adopt a new ordinance at the time of said adjustment.
      (2)   The operation and maintenance portion of the rates are only changed
after a review of all expenses, less purchased gas, and approved by city
ordinance. Based on the latest rate analysis (August 2015), the operation and
maintenance portion of the rate is:
 
Inside City
Customer charge $10.05
All usage*      $4.75 per 1,000 cubic feet
*In addition to the above rates, a charge per 1,000 cubic feet will be
assessed based on the current cost of gas in order for the city to pay its
supplier.
 
 
Outside City
Customer charge $13.05
All usage*      $4.75 per 1,000 cubic feet
The customer charge is charged to all customers and does not include any usage
allowance.
*In addition to the above rates, a charge per 1,000 cubic feet will be
assessed based on the current cost of gas in order for the city to pay its
supplier.
 
   (C)   Deposits for gas service.
      (1)   Every person or business applying for utility service from the City
of Olive Hill shall place with the Utility Clerk a customer deposit to secure
the payment of his or her utility bill. Utility deposits may not be transferred
from one location to another and utility service will not be connected until
deposits are paid.
      (2)   Deposit rates:
 
   Residential Deposits
Landowner     $175
Renter/Tenant $200
   Small Commercial Deposits
Deposit       $300
   Large Commercial/Industrial Deposits
Deposit       $1,000
 
      (3)   A customer deposit refund will be made when the customer requests a
discontinuation of the service and all claims due to the city have been paid.
Any residential customer who owns and resides in the residence may request a
refund of their customer deposit following two years of continuous residency
and that possess a good payment record with the city. Any customer who owns
real estate and has been a resident for two years with a good payment record
with the city will not be required to make customer deposits on additional
residences in their name. All businesses must place deposits with the city
regardless of prior deposits made. Customer deposits held for businesses and
non-property owners will not be refunded until all claims due to the city are
paid in full.
      (4)   Customer deposits shall be refunded plus the amount of interest
accrued, less 1% administrative costs.
   (D)   Tap fees and connections to gas system. Only property owners can apply
for and obtain a gas tap.
   Inside City
Residential tap fee         $300
Commercial - small or large $400
Industrial                  $500
   Outside City
Residential tap fee         $400
Commercial - small or large $500
Industrial                  $600
 
   (E)   Disconnection of services.
      (1)   If the bill for service is not paid in full on dates due,
(fifteenth of each month) a 10% penalty will be added after 10:00 a.m. the
following work day and the account or accounts deemed delinquent. A cutoff list
will be provided for the meter readers or other city workers for disconnection
of utility service and delinquent utility accounts shall be disconnected
beginning the twenty-sixth day of the month during which they become
delinquent.
      (2)   If all past utilities and reconnects are not paid in full by the
month following disconnection, the account will be deemed final and all
deposits held on the account will be applied. In order to initiate new services
the occupant will be required to apply new deposits with the city utilities and
pay all back bills that the previous deposits did not cover.
   (F)   Reconnection fees. There will be a $25 reconnect fee per utility if
disconnection of services occurs.
   (G)   Meter testing. In the event of a customer complaint that metering
equipment is not valid the customer shall place with the city a $50 deposit and
the City of Olive Hill Utilities will have meter tested at the expense of the
city. If said meter is found to be functioning properly, there will be no
refund of the deposit and all amounts and penalties will be due by the due
dates. If said meter is found to be incorrect in reading, the city shall
replace said meter and refund the customers deposit of $50. The customer is
responsible for the payment of current bill during the time of testing and all
penalties will occur on scheduled dates.
   (H)   Returned checks and fees. Returned checks will be assessed a $25
returned check fee. After receiving two returned checks the customer will be
notified either in writing or per phone that the utility company will not
accept their personal check as payment for utility payments for a period of one
year. Returned checks that are not paid for in full within two weeks of the
date of issue will be disconnected for nonpayment of services.
   (I)   Theft of services. Any person or persons found attempting to bypass or
tamper with any utility recording instrument will be prosecuted to the fullest
extent of the law and shall have all services disconnected until Utility Clerk
approves reinstatement.
   (J)   Additional services.
      (1)   The city will commence at a point on an existing gas main, make a
tap, furnish and install gas line to the property boundary or 100 feet,
whichever is less. If it is necessary to cross roads or go through rock, the
extra expense will be borne by the customer. The customer is responsible for
the gas line from the gas meter to the building. The city will furnish the gas
meter and regulator.
      (2)   All utilities must be installed in accordance with previously
adopted codes and state regulations and will be subject to inspection at any
time.
      (3)   Under no circumstances shall the City Council, City Clerk or Office
of the Mayor interfere in the payment of these bills when due. Also, there
shall be no guarantee of payment from Council Members, City Clerk or Mayor
unless full payment is made at the time by check, cash or money order to the
Utility Office. The Utility Department Office shall enforce the section and
shall not deviate from this section under any circumstances.

   (D)   Power cost adjustment.
      (1)   Applicability. The power cost adjustment (PCA) is applicable to all
residential, commercial, and industrial customers and adjusts the rates therein
for changes in the cost of wholesale power purchased. The changes in wholesale
power cost are equal to the current cost of wholesale power per kWh sold, less
the average cost of power included in the currently effective rates. The PCA is
determined on a monthly basis and will both increase and decrease consistent
with the changes in wholesale power cost.
      (2)   Calculation.
 
The PCA is calculated pursuant to the following formula
 
PCA = PC / kWh x LL - APC
 
PCA = The adjustment factor per kWh applicable to all kWh billed during the month
 
PC = The total cost of power purchased on the most recent bill from the city’s
wholesale power supplier
 
KWh = The total kWh purchased on the most recent bill from the city’s wholesale
power supplier
 
LL = The factor to adjust the average power cost for line losses. The current
adjustment is 8.0%
 
APC = The average power cost per kWh included in the city’s current rates. The
current average cost is $0.07986

utility pole available for that purpose.
      (2)   The monthly charges for security lights shall be as follows:
additional line or service if it is necessary for the city to provide
additional line or service to the customer, then an estimated bill will be
presented to the customer and said amount must be deposited with the City
Utility Clerk before the service is provided. If the charge is determined by
the city to be excessive after work is completed, then a refund will be made by
the city to the customer. If the charge is found to be insufficient, the
customer shall be responsible for the difference.
   (F)   Service entrances/compliance with applicable codes and regulations.
      (1)   If the city determines that major reworking of any service entrance
is required in order to be safe or to be adaptable to proper metering, then the
customer shall be notified in writing by the City Utility Clerk. Such customer
will be permitted 30 days to rework their service entrance. If the customer
fails to rework the service entrance, then the service shall be disconnected
until such time the service has been reworked and inspected by the Commonwealth
Electrical Inspector. Such customer shall be charged a reconnect fee. A
customer may be granted an additional 30-day extension to comply if it is
determined that a hardship exists. To request an extension due to hardship, the
customer must request same in writing.

entrance may request in writing to have their service entrance checked for
legitimacy to avoid prosecution or if such customers recently moved into a new
business or house.
      (3)   All utilities must be installed in accordance with all applicable
local, state, and national codes/regulations and will be subject to inspection
at any time.
   (G)   Disconnection of services.
      (1)   If electric service is not paid in full on dates due (fifteenth of
each month), a 10% penalty will be added after 10:00 a.m. the following work
day and the account or accounts deemed delinquent. A cutoff list will be
provided for the meter readers or other city workers for disconnection of
utility service and delinquent utility accounts shall be disconnected beginning
the twenty-sixth day of the month during which they become delinquent.
      (2)   If all past utilities balances and reconnects are not paid in full
by the month following disconnection, the account will be deemed final and all
deposits held on the account will be applied. In order to initiate new
services, the occupant will be required to apply new deposits with the city
utilities and pay all back bills that the previous deposits did not cover.
      (3)   Under no circumstance shall the City Council, City Clerk, or Office
of the Mayor interfere in the payment of these bills when due. Also, there
shall be no guarantee of payment from Council members, City Clerk, or Mayor
unless full payment is made at the time by check, cash, or money order to the
utility office. The Utility Department office shall enforce the ordinance and
shall not deviate from this subchapter under any circumstances.
   (H)   Reconnection fees. There will be a $25 reconnect fee per electric
service if disconnection of services occurs.
   (I)   Meter testing. In the event of a customer complaint that the city’s
metering equipment is not valid, the customer shall place with the city a $50
deposit and the City Utilities will have meter tested at the expense of the

returned check fee. After receiving two returned checks, the customer will be
notified either in writing or by phone that the utility company will not accept
their personal check as payment for utility payments for a period of one year.
All returned checks and returned check fees that are not paid in full within
two weeks of the date of issue will result in their electric service being
disconnected for nonpayment of services.
   (K)   Theft of services. Any person or persons found attempting to bypass or
tamper with any electric metering or recording instrument, shall be prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law and shall have their electric service
disconnected until such time that the city approves reinstatement. All
customers are responsible for the legitimacy of their own service entrance. If
such service entrance is found to be wired in such a way as to steal electrical
service or the metering device has been tampered with, turned upside down, or
bypassed, such customer shall be charged with the appropriate offense,
including theft of services. In the event that such customer’s electric service
is to be reconnected, they shall be charged with the normal reconnect fee.
   (L)   Tree trimming.
      (1)   In order to provide safe and reliable service, trees and other
vegetation must not be allowed to interfere with power lines and other

power distribution systems. Therefore, all customers receiving electric service
from the city shall be deemed to have given permission for city personnel to
enter upon their premises for the purpose of maintaining and protecting the
city’s power lines and other equipment.
      (2)   In order to maintain the integrity of the electric distribution
system, the city shall, in its discretion, remove vegetation and remove, cut,

dying, or severely damaged. It may also include removal of trees that would
have to be trimmed to such an extent that the tree would be in danger of dying
or become unsightly.
      (4)   The city may move power lines or shut off service so that trees can
be trimmed or removed safely. The city does not trim or remove trees around
secondary or low-voltage service lines coming into a customer’s building. The
integrity of any such line is the responsibility of the customer.
   (M)   Controlling law, effective date, and the like.
      (1)   Any provision contained herein which is determined to be contrary

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 15.08.010 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the commonwealth has in Kentucky Revised Statutes
delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed
to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council, hereby adopts the following floodplain management
ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 6-28-2005)
§ 15.08.020 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundations
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 6-28-2005)
§ 15.08.030 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 6-28-2005)
§ 15.08.040 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area, and;
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 6-28-2005)
§ 15.08.050 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A ZONES, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations, and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is a new construction.
   A1-30 AND AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   A99 ZONE. The part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO and AR/A ZONES. Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three
feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage areas less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD). BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate
map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and AR/AO
that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1%
or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its flood subgrade (below ground
level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally above ground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other human-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition of STRUCTURE.
   C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES. Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety,
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular
program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not
limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to
avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and
equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during, and after a flood, public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood; and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials, or hazardous waste
   D ZONE. An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or permanent storage
of materials or equipment.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor

floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975 for
FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to
as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the City of Olive Hill
based on specific technical base flood elevation data which established the
area of special flood hazards.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-YEAR FLOOD have a moderate to
low risk of flooding.
   FLOOD, FLOODING or FLOODWATER.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See MUDSLIDES.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See FLOOD-
RELATED EROSION.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing

community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinance, and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state, and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOOD-PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOOD-PROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification, stating that a nonresidential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is water-tight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. The area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory
floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/
or hydrologic analysis.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
15.08.140, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100
years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs convenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be
insured only at very height flood insurance rates.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure, or other
development which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL.
      (1)   The possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the
release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or misoperation of
a dam or appurtenances.
      (2)   The  HAZARD POTENTIAL CLASSIFICATION of a dam does not reflect in
any way the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g.,
safety, structural integrity, and flood routing capacity.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;

drainage districts, flood control districts, or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation, or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill, or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction, or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the Cabinet and a permit
issued; however, the Cabinet, by regulation, may exempt those dams,
embankments, or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to
require approval by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water
supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier, or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the Cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (1) above.

jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance, or operation of any drainage district, ditch, or
system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the
same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by
the Cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water
resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control
thereof so notified. The Commonwealth Bureau of Surface Mining through KRS Ch.
350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Ch. 151 concerning the

Federal Emergency Management Agency, thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 6-28-2005)
§ 15.08.130 ENFORCEMENT; VIOLATION OF NOTICE.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and
any approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or agent of the
Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a person has
caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and conditions of
a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications thereof, a duly
authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a notice to the
person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner, stating the
facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/or of the
permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be remedied to bring
the development into conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit,
and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which period of time
shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the violation, and
whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard.
      (2)   The remedy may include an order to stop work on the development.
The notice shall also state that a citation may be forthcoming in the event
that the requested remedies and corrective actions are not taken, which
citation will request a civil monetary fine, and shall state the maximum fine
which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation; notice of violation.
      (1)   If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or agent of the
floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a person has
caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and conditions of
a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications thereof, a duly
authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a citation to the
offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation issued, how the
violation is to be remedied to bring the development into conformity with this
chapter or with the approved permit, and with what period of time the remedy is
to occur, and what penalty or penalties are recommended.
      (2)   When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation
is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set forth in the
citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or requesting a
hearing before the Code Enforcement Board. If the person to whom the citation
is issued does not respond to the citation within development permit seven
days, that person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.

§ 15.08.140 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variance.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Appeal Board. The Planning and Zoning Board of
Adjustment is hereby designated as the Appeal Board for the purposes of this
chapter.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the County District Court in the same
manner as provided for in §
2.48.030.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of fractionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions of variance. Upon consideration of the factors listed above
and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
      (1)   (a)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a
lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of §§
15.08.200 through
15.08.260 and
15.08.300 through
15.08.320 have been fully considered.
         (b)   As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)   (a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter.
         (b)   For example, in the case of variances to an elevation
requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the
applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant
proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will both
provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (4)   (a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard.
         (b)   In the instance of an historical structure, a determination
shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and
not destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
15.08.050 under “public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section), or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (7)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (8)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use, provided, that the provisions of divisions (A)
through (D) above and this division (E) are satisfied and that the structure or
other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during
the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and
does not create a public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator at the office of the County Clerk and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
and
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition in §
15.08.050) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 6-28-2005)
§ 15.08.150 PENALTY.
   (A)   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions,
shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction
thereof, be fined no less than $100, nor more than $250 and shall pay all costs
and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. Violations shall be handled procedurally pursuant to, and under the
authority of §
2.48.030 pertaining to the establishment of a Code Enforcement Board.
Jurisdiction for enforcement of the provisions of this chapter is hereby
specifically granted to the

(Ord. 2005-04, passed 6-28-2005)
§ 15.08.210 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
15.08.070, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood

structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of division (C)
below.
      (1)   In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified. (The commonwealth recommends that the lowest floor be elevated
above the highest adjacent grade to a height exceeding the depth number
specified in feet on the FIRM by at least one foot, or elevated at least three
feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.)
      (2)   (a)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. (The commonwealth recommends the
lowest floor be elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation.) The
Floodplain Administrator will determine the method by which base flood
elevations are determined.
         (b)   Methods include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data
can be produced. Title 401 KAR Ch. 4, Regulation 060, § 5(5)a, states as a part
of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: the applicant
shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and their
base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are
not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and
shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot.
         (c)   Cross-section elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the Cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
      (3)   (a)   In all other zones, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation. (The commonwealth recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least
one foot above the base flood elevation.)
         (b)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor and verified by the community building
inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and
verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

      (6)   (a)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood-resistant materials below an
elevation of one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater.
         (b)   Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this
requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect; and
            2.   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood
elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to
allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior wall.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow

            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above
the level of the base flood elevation, (the commonwealth recommends at least
one foot above the base flood elevation); and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (2)   (a)   Excepting manufactured homes that have incurred substantial
damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated
so that:
         (b)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement,
so that either the:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A,
A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highways use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this

licensed and insured in accordance with the commonwealth’s motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways.
      (1)   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
15.08.070, are areas designated as floodways.
      (2)   Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has
erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; and

no greater than a two-to-one ratio unless a stability analysis is provided by a
registered professional engineer.
      (3)   The top of the fill shall be no lower than one foot above the base
flood elevation; however, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a structural
engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the structure from damage
due to erosion, scour, and other hydrodynamic forces.
      (4)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
      (5)    (a)   All new structures built on fill must be constructed on
properly designed and compacted fill (ASTM D-698 or equivalent) that extends
beyond the building walls before dropping below the base flood elevation and
has appropriate protection from erosion and scour.
         (b)   The design of the fill or the fill standard must be approved by

his or her duties, the assistance and cooperation of the Chief of Police and/or
County Sheriff’s office in enforcing orders of the City and/or County Attorney
in prosecuting violations, and of other officials.
      (2)   (a)   The Administrative/Enforcement Officer shall be authorized to
issue building permits. The Administrative/Enforcement Officer shall keep
accurate records in a permanent file and/or certificates of occupancy in
accordance with the literal terms of this chapter, but may not have the power
to permit any construction, or to permit any use or any change of use which
does not conform to the literal terms of this chapter, for the issuance of
building permits, certificates of occupancy, inspections, violations, stop-
orders, and condemnations.
         (b)   If the Administrative/Enforcement Officer finds any provisions
of the ordinance being violated, the person or persons responsible for such
violation shall be notified by the Admin istrative/Enforcement Officer through
registered mail. Said notification shall order the discontinuation of any
illegal use of land, buildings, and/or structures.
      (3)   Any permit or certificate of occupancy issued in conflict with the
provisions of this chapter shall be null and void.
      (4)   The Administrative/Enforcement Officer shall be required to inform
and/or report his or her actions to the Planning Commission. Said report shall
be in writing and issued to the Planning Commission on or before each monthly
meeting.
   (B)   Building permits.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful to commence the excavation for or the
construction of any building, including accessory buildings over 200 square
feet, or to commence the moving, alteration, or demolition of any building,

istrative/Enforcement Officer has issued a building permit for such work.
      (2)   Building permits shall be required for all structures over 200
square feet with a roof.
      (3)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be required in
the following cases:

   (C)   Procedure.
      (1)   Application. In applying to the Administrative/Enforcement Officer
for a building permit, the applicant shall submit a plan along with the
application; drawn to scale, showing the dimensions of the lot to be built
upon, the outside dimensions of all structures to be constructed or altered,
and all existing structures the use of structures, yard depths, and any other
information necessary for determining compliance with this order. The City

      (3)   Restraint of construction without permit. If no building permit has
been issued and a builder begins or continues to build, a restraining order may
be obtained upon application to the proper court of record. Evidence of the
lack of a building permit shall establish a prima facie case for the issuance
of the restraining order.
      (4)   Validity. The issuance of a building permit shall not waive any
provisions of this regulation.
      (5)   Duration. A building permit shall become void one year from the
date of issuance unless substantial progress has been made by that date on the
construction or alteration authorized therein. A building permit may be renewed
without fee upon review by the Administrative/Enforcement Officer before it
becomes void.
   (D)   Certificate of occupancy. No land or buildings or part thereof
hereafter erected or altered in its use or structure shall be used until the
Administrative/Enforcement Officer shall have issued a certificate of occupancy
stating that such land, building, or part thereof and the proposed use thereof,
are found to be in conformity with the provisions of this regulation. Within
three days after notification that a building or premises or part thereof is
ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty of the Administrative/
Enforcement Officer to make a final inspection thereof and to issue a
certificate of occupancy if the land, building, or part thereof and the
proposed use thereof, are found to conform with the provisions of this
regulation; or, if such certification is refused, to state refusal in writing
with the cause, and immediately thereupon to mail notice of such refusal to the
applicant at the address indicated in the application.

reported to the City and/or County Attorney who shall initiate prosecution
procedures.

§ 17.04.100 NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES, AND USES.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit nonconforming lots,
structures, and/or uses to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival.
      (2)   It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded, extended, or be used as grounds for adding
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots of record.
      (1)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a
single-family dwelling and permitted accessory uses, including manufactured and
certified mobile homes as permitted in §§
17.04.600 through
17.04.680, may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership
and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
      (2)   (a)   This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area and width or both that are generally applicable in
the district; provided, that yard dimensions and requirements other than those
applying to area or width or both of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located.
         (b)   Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through
action of the Board of Adjustment.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses of land and structures.
      (1)   Where, at the time of passage of this chapter, the lawful use of a
building or premises exists which would not be permitted by the regulations
imposed by this chapter; and
      (2)   The use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise legal with
the following limitations.
         (a)   A nonconforming use shall not be extended, enlarged, or moved to
occupy any portion of land or structure except in conformity with this chapter.
         (b)   A nonconforming use shall not be reestablished after
discontinuation for a period of six months. Vacating of premises or building or
non-operative status shall be evidence of a discontinued use.
         (c)   1.   A nonconforming structure damaged to an extent greater than
50% of the current replacement value may be repaired and restored only to a
structure and use conforming to the provisions of this chapter; provided,
however, that a nonconforming residential structure may be rebuilt in the same
general yard area if such damage is due to fire or natural causes and if
rebuilt within six months of the date of damage.
            2.   Manufactured and certified mobile homes are only placed on
lots in conformance with §§
17.04.600 through
17.04.680.
            3.   Restoring to a safe condition of any structure declared to be
unsafe by any public official shall not be prohibited by this regulation.
         (d)   All nonconforming uses shall be changed only to a conforming
use; provided, however, that dimensional variances may be granted.
         (e)   1.   An owner claiming a continuing nonconforming use shall bear
the burden of showing that said use was in existence as of the effective date
of this chapter and has not been discontinued for a period of one year since
said effective date.
            2.   An owner may register a continuing nonconforming use with the
Administrative/Enforcement Officer within 12 months of the adoption of this
chapter to establish that said use was in existence as of the effective date of
this chapter.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures.
      (1)   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
      (2)   Any proposed addition or substantial remodeling of a nonconforming
structure may be granted after public hearing as a dimensional variance by the
Board of Adjustment. The Board must first determine that the proposed addition
or substantial remodeling will not facilitate or expand a nonconforming use
before such variance can be granted.
   (E)   Ordinary repair and maintenance.
      (1)   Work may be done on ordinary repair and maintenance, or on repair
or replacement of non-load-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing.
      (2)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition a building or other structure in
accordance with the order of an appropriate public agency which declares such
building or other structure to be unsafe and its restoration to a safe
condition.

§ 17.04.120 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   Existing parking spaces. Existing off-street parking provided for any
building or use at the time of adoption of this chapter shall not hereafter be
reduced if such reduction results in parking area less than that required by
this chapter. Any existing building or use not provided with a conforming
parking space shall be provided with an off-street parking space in conformance
with this chapter at the time of any structural alteration of the building or
expansion of the use.
   (B)   Required off-street parking spaces. When any building is built or any
use of the land is initiated, there shall be provided sufficient off-street
parking space on the premises so that no automobile parking on any street will
result from the normal activity. If the off-street parking capacity is exceeded
and street parking is generated more often than six times during a six-month
period, this shall be considered as resulting from normal activity, and
additional off-street parking shall be provided. The Board of Adjustment shall
interpret the amount of parking space required for any building or use,
assisted by the following standards, whenever the Administrative/Enforcement
Officer is unable to apply the following standards literally or determines a
parking space deficiency. In either case, he or she shall apply to the Board
for an original interpretation.
   (C)   Off-street parking standards. The following standards comprise the
minimum off-street parking requirements for the several common types of
building and uses listed:
      (1)   Dwelling. Two parking spaces per dwelling unit;
      (2)   Indoor retail businesses. One parking space for each 250 square
feet of commercial floor area, plus one space for every truck operated by the
business;
      (3)   Industrial Plants. One parking space for every two employees at
maximum employment on a single shift, plus one space for every truck operated
by the plant;
      (4)   Places for public assembly, institutions, and recreational
facilities. One parking space for every five persons based on maximum capacity;
and
      (5)   Additional parking standards. The Board of Adjustment may alter the
standards listed above when necessary to conform with division (B) above and
shall use similar criteria of floor area, employment, or capacity to interpret
standards for buildings and uses not specifically listed above.
   (D)   Off-street loading and unloading space regulations for trucks.
      (1)   All buildings and uses which generate regular trucking traffic
shall be provided with sufficient loading and unloading space on the premises
so that they will generate no loading or unloading activity on their required
parking spaces or on any street.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall interpret the amount of loading and
unloading space required for any building or use whenever the Administrative/
Enforcement Officer is unable to apply this standard literally and applies to
the Board for an original interpretation.
   (E)   Additional parking, loading and unloading regulations.
      (1)   Arrangement of off-street parking space. Off-street parking space
required for any building or use may be located within walking distance or 400
feet from the premises it serves but detached therefrom and may be consolidated
into a large parking area serving other buildings and uses if approved by the
Board of Adjustment. The Administrative/Enforcement Officer shall apply to the
Board for an original interpretation when building permits are requested in
such cases. The Board may not authorize the total amount of parking space
required for all buildings and uses to be diminished except as follows: If a
consolidation parking area serves buildings or uses which do not generate
automobile parking at the same time, e.g., churches and stores, total parking
space may be diminished to the maximum required by those buildings and uses
which do generate the parking of automobiles at the same time.
      (2)   Proof of availability. The Board of Adjustment may require a plat,
deed, and any other proof necessary to show that required parking space, if
located off the premises it serves, is controlled by and available to the
applicant for a building permit.
      (3)   Surfacing of parking, loading and unloading spaces. Parking,
loading, and unloading spaces and the access thereto shall be surfaced in a
manner adequate to eliminate dust and mud.
   (F)   City ordinances. Nothing in this section shall be construed to be in
conflict with this code of ordinances and any other city ordinances regarding
the parking of vehicles on city streets.

§ 17.04.140 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Generally. Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general

Commission and subject to procedures by law, amend, supplement, change, or
repeal the regulations, restrictions, and boundaries or classification of
property.
   (B)   Application for amendment.
      (1)   A proposal for amendment to the official zoning map may originate
with the Planning Commission, the City Council, any other government body, the
owner of the subject property, or by a person having written authorization from
the owner of the subject property. A proposal for amendment to the text of this
chapter may originate with any person or governmental body. Regardless of the
origin of the proposed amendment, an application must be filed with the
Planning Commission requesting the proposed amendment in such form and
accompanied by such information as required by this chapter and the Planning
Commission.
      (2)   The Planning Commission will require the prior submission of a
development plan prepared in accordance with §
17.04.130, which when approved by the Commission, shall be followed. At the
time of filing an application, a filing fee shall be paid according to the

   (C)   Planning Commission Procedure. Upon the filing of an application for
an amendment to the official zoning map or the text of this chapter, the
Planning Commission shall study and review the application as provided in
ordinance and the by-laws of the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission
shall then hold at least one public hearing after notice as required by KRS Ch.
424 and KRS Ch. 100, and shall make findings of fact and a recommendation for
approval or disapproval of the proposed amendment to the various legislative
bodies involved. A tie vote shall be subject to further consideration by the
Planning Commission for a period not to exceed 30 days, at the end of which if
the tie has not been broken, the application shall be forwarded to the or
legislative body without a recommendation for approval or disapproval.
   (D)   Notice of public hearing.
      (1)   Notice of the time, place, and reason for the required public
hearing shall be given by one publication in the newspaper of general

before the public hearing in accordance with KRS 424.130 and KRS 100.211.
      (2)   Any published notice shall include the street address of the
property in question, or if one is not available or practicable due to the
number of addresses involved, a geographic description sufficient to locate and
identify the property, and the names of two streets on either side of the
property which intersect the street on which the property is located, and when
the property in question is located at the intersection of two streets the
notice shall designate the intersection by name of both streets rather than
name two streets on either side of the property.
      (3)   When a hearing is scheduled on a proposal by a property owner to
amend any zoning map, the following notice shall be given in addition to any
other required by statute, local regulation, or ordinance.

            3.   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to post the
sign conspicuously on the property. The Enforcement Officer shall verify to the
Planning Commission at the hearing that placement occurred pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter.
         (c)   Notice of the hearing shall be given at least 14 days in advance
of the hearing by first class mail, with certification by the Commission’s

classification of which is proposed to be changed. It shall be the duty of the
person or persons proposing the map amendment to furnish to the Planning
Commission the names and addresses of the owners of all adjoining property.
Records maintained by the Property Valuation Administrator may be relied upon
conclusively to determine the identity and address of said owner. In the event
such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, then the
person notified by mail shall be the president or Chairperson of the owner
group which administers property commonly owned by the condominium or
cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two or more co-owners of an
adjoining property who are listed in the Property Valuation Administrator’s
records as having the same address.
         (d)   In addition to the public notice requirements of this section,
when the Planning Commission or legislative body of any planning unit

§ 17.04.330 GENERAL BUSINESS DISTRICTS (B-1).
   (A)   The purpose of the General Business District is to provide retail
stores and personal service outlets to meet the need of the people in adjacent
or nearby residential areas for convenient services. These districts are
closely related to residential districts but they are also commercial areas
that generate activities that can be disruptive in residential areas unless
they are properly regulated.
   (B)   (1)   The intent of these regulations is to make the B-1 Districts as
compatible as possible with associated residential districts while permitting
commercial activity.
      (2)   This District also includes highway-oriented commercial
development:
         (a)   Permitted uses.
            1.   Any convenience- and vehicular-oriented type of retail
business or service establishment such as follows: groceries; drug stores; shoe
repair shops; hardware store; barber and beauty shops; clothing shops; garages
for motor vehicle repair within an enclosed building; restaurants; self-service
laundries; filling stations; places of amusement and assembly; car washes; and
antique shops. Any other retail business or service establishment which is
determined by the Board of Adjustment to be of the same general character as
the above mentioned uses.
            2.   Single-, double-, and multi-family dwelling units are
permitted. Manufactured units must comply with §§
17.04.600 through
17.04.680;

customarily carried on as a business government offices; and
            2.   The Board of Adjustment may attach certain conditions to its
approval which it feels are necessary to preserve and protect the character of
the district in which the proposed use would locate.
         (c)   Accessory uses. Any accessory use or building customarily
incidental to the above permitted uses is permitted, including dwelling units
occupying the same building as the principal commercial use and being for use
by the owner/operator;
         (d)   Required conditions.
            1.   Screening. Where a side lot line is shared with an adjoining
residential lot, a well maintained compact hedge, a solid fence or similar
solid screening device at least six feet in height shall be installed to screen
the business use from the adjoining lot in the Residential District. The screen
shall begin at the front building line and extend along the common side lot
line to the rear property line.
            2.   Access to highways and streets.
               a.   In all commercial zones, points of access to highways and
streets shall be controlled by the Planning Commission pursuant to §
17.04.430. Before any building permit for any structure in a B-1 District may
be issued, the prospective building or operator of the proposed B-1 activity
shall submit a sketch of the layout and design of the proposed structure and/or
use and its access points to the highway and/or street to the Planning
Commission.
               b.   The Planning Commission may require that when two or more
consumer commercial establishments adjoin along one side of any street or
highway that they share access points to the street. When more than four
consumer commercial establishments adjoin along any highway or street, a road
parallel to the highway or street may be built, at the expense of all adjoining
consumer commercial establishments, to provide service to all consumer
commercial establishments on the same side of the street or highway.
               c.   This road shall have access to the highway or street at no
more than two points for every four consumer commercial establishments. The
provisions of §§

report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time that it is
furnished to the Chairperson of the Board.
      (3)   If the Board finds that the facts alleged in the report of the
Administrative/Enforcement Officer are true and that the landowner has taken no
steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the
hearing, the Board may authorize the Administrative/Enforcement Officer to
revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause
the termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit
authorizes.
   (E)   Once the Board has completed a conditional use permit and all the
conditions required are of such type that they can be completely and
permanently satisfied, the Administrative/Enforcement Officer upon request of
the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the
conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts which indicate that the
conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of
the conditional use permit which is on file with the County Clerk, as required
by KRS 100.237. Thereafter, said use, if it continues to meet the other
requirements of the regulations, will be treated as a permitted use.

§ 17.04.1040 DIMENSIONAL VARIANCE.
   (A)   (1)   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide on
applications for dimensional variances where, by reason of the exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of a site on the effective date of
this chapter or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or some other
extraordinary situation or condition of that site, the literal enforcement of
the dimensional requirements (height or width of building or size of yards, but
not population density) of this chapter would deprive the applicant of
reasonable capacity to make use of the land in a manner equivalent to the use
permitted other landowners in the same district.
      (2)   The Board may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions on
any variance it decides to grant.
   (B)   Before any variance is granted, the Board must find all of the
following, which shall be recorded along with any imposing conditions or
restrictions in its minutes and records and issued in written form to the
applicant to constitute proof of the dimensional variance:
      (1)   The specific conditions in detail which are unique to the
applicant’s land and which do not exist on other land in the same zone;
      (2)   The manner in which the strict application of the provisions of the
ordinance would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land in the
manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone;
      (3)   The unique conditions and circumstances are not the result of
actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance;
      (4)   Reasons that the variance will preserve, not harm, the public
safety and welfare and will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood;
      (5)   Consideration of all adjoining property owners’ comments regarding
the variance request. The Board shall not possess the power to grant a variance
to permit a use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by
the ordinance in the district in question, or to alter density requirements in
the district in question; and
      (6)   A dimensional variance applies to the property for which it is
granted, and not to the individual who applied for it. A variance also runs
with the land and is transferable to any future owner of the land, but it
cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different site.

§ 17.04.1060 EXISTING NONCONFORMING USE, CONTINUANCE, AND CHANGE.
   (A)   The lawful use of a building or premises, existing at the time of the
adoption of this chapter affecting it may be continued, although such use does
not conform to the provisions of such regulation, except as otherwise provided
herein. (See §
17.04.100 for details.)
   (B)   The Board of Adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or extension
of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at the time
the ordinance, which makes its use nonconforming, was adopted, nor shall the
Board permit a change from one nonconforming use to any other nonconforming
use.

§ 17.04.1070 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   (A)   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide cases where it is
alleged by an applicant that there is error in any order, requirement,
decision, grant, or refusal made by the Administrative/Enforcement Official in
the enforcement of this chapter.
   (B)   A request for review shall be taken within 30 days after the applicant
or his or her agent receives notice of the action alleged to be in error.

§ 17.04.1080 PROCEDURES FOR ALL APPEALS TO THE BOARD.
   (A)   (1)   Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person or entity
claiming to be injuriously affected or aggrieved by an official action or
decision of any officer enforcing this chapter. Such appeal shall be taken
within 30 days after the appellant or his or her agent receives notice of the
action appealed from by filing with said officer and with the appropriate Board
a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and giving notice of such
appeal to any and all parties of record.
      (2)   Said officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken and shall
be treated as and be the respondent in such further proceedings.
      (3)   At any hearing by the Board, any interested person may appear and
enter his or her appearance, and all shall be given opportunity to be heard.
   (B)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give
public notice in accordance with KRS Ch. 424, as well as written notice to the
appellant and the Admin istrative/Enforcement Official at least one week prior
to the hearing, and shall decide it within 60 days. The affected party may
appear at the hearing in person or by attorney.
   (C)   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any final
action of the Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment may appeal from the
action to the County Circuit Court in which the land lies.
   (D)   (1)   All appeals shall be taken in the Circuit Court within 30 days
after the action or decision of the Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment
and all decisions which have not been appealed within 30 days shall become
final.
      (2)   After the appeal is taken, the procedure shall be governed by the
rules of civil procedure. When an appeal has been filed, the Clerk of the
Circuit Court shall issue a summons to all parties, including the Planning
Commission in all cases, and shall cause it to be delivered for service as in
any other law action.
