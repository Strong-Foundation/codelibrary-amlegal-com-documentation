PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 31B.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)   As defined in §
31B.01 , and subject to the limitations set forth in §
31B.12 , any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a written application, signed by the applicant with his or her name
and contact information printed legibly on the application/request, describing
the records to be inspection, at the office of the City Clerk during regular
office hours, except during legal holidays or to be copied. Additionally, the
applicant shall provide a statement, in the written application, of the manner
in which the applicant is a resident of the Commonwealth under KRS 61.870(10)
(a) to (f) and §
31B.01  herein. The application shall be hand delivered, mailed, sent via
facsimile, or sent via e-mail to:
      (1)   If via mail or hand delivery: City Clerk, City of Morehead, 314
Bridge Street, Morehead, KY 40351;
      (2)   If via facsimile: City Clerk, 606-784-2216; or
      (3)   If via e-mail: City Clerk or City Attorney.
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in compliance
with the open records law and the requested records are available, the
custodian shall make the records available for inspection within five (5) days
(excepting, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) of receipt of the request.
Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk
during regular business hours of the city for the inspection. No person shall
remove original copies of public records from the offices of the city without
the written permission of the official custodian of the record. The applicant
shall have the right to make abstracts of the public records and to obtain
copies of public records not exempted under this chapter, the Kentucky Revised
Statutes, or federal law. Payment of the prescribed fee in §
31B.01  shall be required for all copies.
   (C)   An applicant may request copies of said public records in lieu of
inspection. If requested, the custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of
all fees and the cost of mailing.
   (D)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the city
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. The city is not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
   (E)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than 8-1/2 inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor’s requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
   (F)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
   (G)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (F) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
   (H)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the city.
If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means and the public
agency agrees to provide online access, the city may require that the party
enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with the agency, and may
charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (F).

§ 31B.07 PUBLIC RECORDS IN ACTIVE USE, STORAGE OR NOT OTHERWISE AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed five (5) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.

Statutory reference:
   For similar provisions under state law, see KRS 61.872(5)
§ 31B.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the city, the official
custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or mail copies
of public records. However, refusal under this section must be sustained by
clear and convincing evidence.
(Am. Ord. 15:2021, passed 8-9-21)

   For similar provisions under state law, see KRS 61.872(6)
§ 31B.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five (5) day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or
in part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian’s authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General’s request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General’s opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.

initial membership, and thereafter in July of each year, elect from its members
a chairman and a vice chairman. It may, in its discretion, employ an Executive
Director and a Secretary-Treasurer, neither of whom shall be a member of the
Board; provided, however, if the creation and establishment of the Authority is

time prescribe and alter such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary.
   (C)   The Executive Director, if and when employed in the discretion of the
Board, shall be experienced and knowledgeable in the field of transportation;
and if and when employed, such Executive Director shall be the Chief Executive
Officer of the Authority, having such powers and duties as the Board may
prescribe. Such Executive Director may recommend the establishment or
alteration of rules and regulations, and of rates and charges for use of the
services and facilities of the mass transportation system of the Authority; but
action in such respects, and in the issuance of revenue bonds or mortgage bonds
of the Authority, and in requesting the issuance of general obligation bonds by
other public bodies for the benefit of the Authority for financing purposes,
shall be taken by the Board, or by the Executive Committee of the Board if
properly thereunto authorized.

Board, and shall also keep a set of books showing the receipts and expenditures
of the Board. He shall preserve on file duplicate vouchers for all expenditures
and shall present to the Board, upon request, complete reports of all financial

Director, if and when such Executive Director shall be employed, each to
execute bond in favor of the Authority, in such respective penal sums as the
Board may fix, in favor of the Authority, and conditioned upon faithful
performance of the duties of such offices and full accounting to the Authority.
Each such bond shall be with corporate surety, provided by a corporate surety
company qualified to transact business in the state and approved, in each
instance, by the Board. The Board may in like manner require similar bonds,
with corporate surety, to be given by other officers, agents and employees in

   Authority and may be chargeable as an operating expense of the Authority.
   (F)   The Board shall fix the salaries, wages or other compensation of the
officers, agents, and employees whom it may engage from time to time; in each
case within such limitations, if any, as may be prescribed in the proceedings
or joint proceedings set forth in the establishment of the Authority, or as
such proceedings may be amended; but such salaries, wages or other compensation
shall constitute obligations of the Authority only, and shall be payable from
the Authority's revenues and any other available resources, and shall not
constitute obligations of any city or county participating in the creation or
subsequent enlargement, of the Authority.
   (G)   The Board may, by resolution duly adopted and spread at large upon its
public records, establish an executive committee, composed of such members of
the Board as may be specified in such resolution and may authorize such
executive committee to exercise in intervals between Board meetings any powers
of the Board except those powers which are expressly required by this
subchapter or by other controlling provisions of law to be exercised by the
Board.
   (H)   The Board may create such other committees of its members as it may
deem necessary or proper; but the same shall be advisory in nature and shall
report to the Board or to the executive committee, and shall not be authorized

§ 34.80 ACQUISITION OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS BY PURCHASE OR CONDEMNATION;
SUBSIDIES.
   (A)   A Transit Authority may establish mass transportation within its
transit area and adjoining areas, but may not inaugurate service in direct
competition with any existing certificated carrier.
   (B)   In addition to the power conferred upon the authority by KRS Chapter
96A, the Authority may acquire real or personal property, easements,
franchises, but certificates, or other rights by any lawful means necessary to
its operation of any existing mass transit system within its transit area and
adjoining areas, provided that having acquired an existing transit system it
shall not thereafter inaugurate service in direct competition with any other
existing certificated carrier.
   (C)   The Authority may, if unable to contract or agree with the owners
thereof, acquire real and personal property, franchises, bus certificates,
easements and other rights when necessary in and to the accomplishments of the
public purposes of the Authority, through exercise of the power of eminent
domain; provided, however, that in acquiring any private bus company pursuant
to this section, the Authority may not do so piecemeal but shall acquire the
entire system including that which may be outside the area then included with
the Authority. The Authority shall not condemn any real and personal property,
franchises, bus certificates, easements, and other rights of a private bus
company the majority of whose passengers move between termini without the
transit area. Any exercise of such power shall be initiated by resolution of
the board of the Authority identifying the properties or rights to be acquired,
reciting the board's determination that acquisition by such means is necessary,
and authorizing initiation of proceedings as required by law; and such
resolution of the board of the Authority shall not be conclusive of such
determination but shall be subject to the approval of the fiscal court or
courts of the county or counties in which the property sought to be condemned
is located.
   (D)   Proceedings in the exercise of the power of eminent domain herein
vested in the Authority shall, except where inconsistent with KRS Ch. 96A, be
such as are prescribed for the Bureau of Highways by the Eminent Domain Act of
Kentucky, and as the same may be amended and supplemented from time to time.
All such proceedings shall be governed by the provisions of the Rules of Civil
Procedure except where the provisions of KRS Ch. 96A or of the Eminent Domain
Act of Kentucky specifically or by necessary implication provide otherwise. If
a privately owned mass transportation system, or other property sought to be
acquired by the Authority, shall have been acquired or improved in whole or in
part at the expense of the Authority, the cost and value of such acquisitions
and improvements shall be excluded in any proceedings to establish the fair
value thereof.
   (E)   During any period when negotiations for the purchase of a mass transit
system are in progress, and/or during any period when proceedings for
acquisition of transportation system through exercise of the power of eminent
domain may be pending, the Authority may make reasonable subsidy payments to
the owner or owners of such mass transit system if, in the judgment of the
board of the Authority, such subsidy payments are necessary in order to give
reasonable assurance that there will be no substantial reduction of
transportation service to the public, such subsidy payments may be made by the
Authority from any resources available to it, or from appropriations made or
agreed to be made to it by any public body having an interest in the
preservation of mass transit service to the public; and if bonds are ultimately
issued for the purchase or other acquisition of such mass transit system, the
aggregate amount of such subsidy payments may be included as a part of the cost
of acquisition and made payable from the proceeds of such bonds. In no event,
however, shall any action on the part of a board of the Authority in this
connection create an indebtedness of the Authority beyond its available
resources or such appropriations or the proceeds of such bonds, if and when
bonds are issued.
(Ord. passed 10-8-91)
§ 34.81 APPROPRIATIONS AND GRANTS.
   (A)   The Transit Authority of Morehead-Rowan County shall not be vested

and establishment of the Authority, or in the subsequent enlargement thereof,
may, in the proceedings or joint proceedings, or by subsequent action,
appropriate and pay over to the Authority from its general funds or from other
resources not required by law to be appropriated for other purposes, any sum or
sums of money, or any property which such public body shall determine to be
necessary or advisable in furtherance of the public purposes of the authority
as set forth in KRS Ch. 96A. The Authority may receive monies or property from
any such source, and may use the same in furtherance of its proper purposes;
but the Authority shall not pledge anticipated appropriations from any such
source for any period beyond the period for which any such appropriations shall
be made, except to the extent of committing that any such appropriation, when
and if actually received by the Authority, without commitment as to the
possible amount thereof, will be applied by the Authority in certain specified
ways.
   (C)   The Authority may accept gifts, grants, or loans of money or other
property from the United States, the state or any person or entity for such
purposes, may enter into any agreement required in connection therewith, may
comply with any federal or state laws or regulations applicable thereto, and
may hold, use, and dispose of such money or property in accordance with the
terms of the gift, grant, loan, or agreement relating thereto.

federal agencies appropriations or grants to accomplish the promotion and
development of mass transit services in Kentucky, and to receive and accept aid
or contributions from any source of either money, property, labor, or other
things of value to promote mass transit services. Subject to the provisions of
Section 230 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, any funds,
property, or things of value received by the department of transportation may
be given directly to a local transit authority as created under this subchapter
or to a city or a county, in order to accomplish the purposes of this section.
   (B)   The department of transportation is authorized and directed to apply
for any available federal funds for operating subsidies, either on a matching
basis or otherwise and to make any said funds received available to transit
authorities created under this subchapter or to a city or a county in order to
accomplish the purposes of this section, or in such cases where federal laws or
regulations preclude the department of transportation from direct application
for such federal funds the department is authorized and directed to provide
assistance to local transit authorities or a city or a county as necessary to
enable it to apply for and obtain such federal funds, in order to accomplish
the purposes of this section.
   (C)   The department of transportation is authorized to assist cities and
counties in the formation of local transit authorities in conformance with this
subchapter, but nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as preventing the
department of transportation from providing such assistance as authorized in
this subchapter to cities or counties where local transit authorities do not
exist.

§ 34.83 MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS.
   The Authority may operate any mass transit system which it establishes or
acquires; or instead of operating the same in its own name, the Authority may
enter into one or more management contracts for operating the same or any part
thereof, under such terms and conditions as it may determine to be proper and
desirable; provided, however, any such management contract shall retain in the

charges to be exacted from the public for use of the services and facilities
referred to therein, and the power to issue revenue bonds, mortgage bonds, or
other obligations of the Authority payable from the income and revenues

transit service. In carrying out its purposes, the Authority shall consider its
highway, road and street systems on federal, state, and local levels.

for a period of one year (which may be from the date of the mortgage bonds, or
from the date of acquisition or other establishment of the mass transit system
or systems referred to therein), with exclusive options to the lessee or
lessees to renew the same thereafter, from year to year, for one year at a
time, upon such rentals and other terms and provisions as will provide to the
Authority, in the event such lease is renewed by the lessee or lessees from
time to time in accordance with such options, annual sums sufficient to provide
for meeting the purposes of this section.

§ 34.133 LIENS, FINES, CHARGES AND FEES.
   (A)   The city shall possess a lien on property owned by the person found by
a final, non-appealable final order as defined by KRS 65.8805(8), or by a final
judgment of the court, to have committed a violation of a city ordinance. The
lien shall be for all civil fines assessed for the violation and for all
charges and fees incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of the
ordinance, including abatement costs. An affidavit of the Code Enforcement
Officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the
regularity of the proceedings pursuant to KRS 65.8801 to 65.8839.
   (B)   The lien shall be recorded in the Office of the County Clerk. The lien
shall be notice to all persons from the time of its recording and shall bear
interest until paid. The lien shall continue for ten (10) years following the
date of the nonappealable final order or final court judgment.
   (C)   The lien shall take precedence over all other liens, except state,
county, school board and city taxes, and may be enforced by judicial
proceedings, including a foreclosure action.
   (D)   In addition to the remedy prescribed in division (A) of this section,
the person found to have committed the violation shall be personally
responsible for the amount of all civil fines assessed for the violation and
for all charges, fees and abatement costs incurred by the city in connection
with the enforcement of this subchapter. The city may bring a civil action
against the person and shall have the same remedies as provided for the
recovery of a debt.
(Ord. 03:2019, passed 2-11-19)
§ 34.134 ABATEMENT AND IMMEDIATE ACTION.
   (A)   All violations of ordinances and codes enforced under this division
shall be remedied by the violator within the time period specified in the
citation and/or final order of the Board. In the absence of a specified time
period the time period for remedy of a violation shall not exceed then (10)
days, however the Code Enforcement Officer or Code Enforcement Board may grant
an extension of this time period. However, nothing in this ordinance shall
prohibit the city from taking immediate action to remedy a violation of its
ordinances when there is reason to believe that the violation presents a
serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if in the absence
of immediate action, the effects of the violation will be irreparable or
irreversible. The city shall have a lien for all abatement costs.
   (B)   If the property owner so served does not abate the violation within
the applicable time period, the city may proceed to abate such violation,
keeping an account of the expense of abatement. The abatement costs, including
necessary and reasonable costs for and associated with clearing, preventing
unauthorized entry to, or demolishing all or a portion of a structure or
premises or taking any other action with regard to a structure or premises
necessary to remedy a violation and to maintain and preserve the public health,
safety, and welfare in accordance with the city ordinances shall be charged to
and paid by the property.
   (C)   Contesting a citation or filing an appeal of a final order shall serve
to toll the city's abatement of the violation, unless the Code Enforcement
Officer has reason to believe that the existence of the violation presents
imminent danger, a serious threat to public health, safety and welfare, or if
in the absence of immediate action, the effects of the violation will be
irreparable or irreversible. In the event the Board or a hearing officer
determines that the violation contested did occur, the Board or hearing officer
may order that the abatement proceed immediately or within a specified time
period not to exceed 30 days.
   (D)   The city shall possess a lien for all costs in accordance with §
34.133.

SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY
§ 39.15 PURPOSE.
   Use of internet social media sites is a popular activity. Employees are
permitted to use personal social networking; however, employees must be mindful
of the negative impact of inappropriate or unauthorized postings upon the City
of Morehead and its relationship with the community. The purpose of this policy
is to give employees guidance regarding inappropriate content for personal
social media websites, web pages, and other electronically transmitted or hard
copied material with respect to the city and to clearly identify prohibited
activities by employees both on and off duty in order to protect the City of
Morehead, its employees and Board of Council from harm as the result of
inappropriate postings or inadvertent harmful postings. This policy is not
meant to address one particular form of social media; rather social media in
general, as advances in technology will occur and new tools will emerge.
Further, the policy is not intended to hinder professional development of any
employee or interfere with an employee’s First Amendment rights.
(Ord. 02:2014, passed 2-10-14)

in meeting community outreach, problem-solving, investigation, crime
prevention, and related objectives. This policy identifies potential uses that
may be explored or expanded upon as deemed reasonable by administrative and
supervisory personnel. Further, the City of Morehead recognizes the role that
these tools play in the lives of city government employee, both in their
personal lives and official capacity and acknowledges that its employees have
the right under the First Amendment, in certain circumstances, to speak out on
matters of public concern not related to their official duties. However, the
city will regulate the use of social media by employees, including employees’
personal use of social media, when such use interferes with or disrupts the
work of the city, is used to harass coworkers or other members of city
government, breaches confidentiality obligations of city employees, creates a
hostile work environment or violates the law or city policies/ordinances.

is imperiled.
      (3)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
   (C)   Purpose and authority.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring
that standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for
officers and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in
their application and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of
the city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
      (2)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements
of KRS 65.003 as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
      (3)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

contract made, entered into, awarded, or granted by the city or a city agency,
with the following exceptions:
      (1)   The prohibition in division (A) of this section shall not apply to
contracts entered into before an elected officer filed as a candidate for city
office, before an appointed officer was appointed to a city or city agency
office, or before an employee was hired by the city or a city agency. However,
if any contract entered into by a city or city agency officer or employee
before he or she became a candidate, was appointed to office, or was hired as
an employee, is renewable after he or she becomes a candidate, assumes the
appointed office, or is hired as an employee, then the prohibition in division

the contract is awarded after public notice and competitive bidding, unless the
officer or employee is authorized to participate in establishing the contract
specification, or awarding, or managing the contract. If the officer or
employee has any of the authorities as set forth in the preceding sentence,
then the officer of employee shall have no interest in the contract, unless the

employee of the city may also be a state officer, deputy state officer, or
member of the General Assembly, or may fill more than one municipal office at
the same time, whether in the same of different city.
   (B)   Pursuant to KRS 61.080, no city officer may also hold a county office.
In addition, the statute also states that the following city and consolidated
local government office are incompatible with other public office:
      (1)   Member of the legislative body of cities of the first class;
      (2)   Mayor and member of the legislative council of a consolidated local
government; and
      (3)   Mayor and member of the legislative body in cities of home class
rule.
   (C)   In addition to the constitution and statutory provisions, there are
common law incompatibilities defined by the courts. City officers and
employment positions are deemed incompatible when one office or position of
employment was inherently inconsistent in function with the other. This
incompatibility occurs when there arises an implication that the duties and
responsibilities of both cannot be performed at the same time with a necessary
degree of impartiality and honesty.
   (D)   KRS 61.090 provides that the acceptance of an incompatible office
operates to vacate the first office.

§ 40.06 WITHDRAWAL FROM PARTICIPATION.
   (A)   An officer or employee must refrain from acting on, or discussing,
formally or informally, a matter before the city, if acting on the matter or
failing to act on the matter, may personally or financially benefit any of the
persons or entities listed in §
40.03 (C) above. Such an officer or employee should leave the room if it is a
public meeting conducted under KRS 61.810 and 61.185.
   (B)   Withdrawal at a meeting requires the public announcement, on the
records, of the reason for withdrawal.
   (C)   Ongoing conflict. An officer or employee whose outside employer, or
other outside activity or relationship, can reasonably be expected to require
more than sporadic withdrawal must resign, or cease such outside employment or
activity. An officer or employee should not begin employment, or an activity,
or relationship that can reasonably be expected to require more than sporadic
withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is in such situation, they
should not accept the position with the city.

of any money whatsoever. No gift of any service, loan, travel, entertainment,
hospitality, thing, or promise or any other form having a fair market value of
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be accepted under circumstances
in which it could reasonably be inferred that the gift was intended to
influence, or could reasonably be expected to influence the officer or employee
in the performance of public duties.
   (B)   Certain items are typically excluded from this provision. Examples of
these items include:
      (1)   Gifts received from family members.
      (2)   Gifts accepted on behalf of the city and transferred to the city.

use or disclose information acquired in the course of his or her official
duties, if the primary purpose of the use or disclosure is to further his or
her personal financial interest or that of another person, group, or business.

the development of a budget which includes compensation for family member,
provided that the family member is included only as a member of a class of
persons or a group, and the family member benefits to no greater extent than
any other similarly situated member of the class or group.
   (D)   In extenuating circumstances, such as in difficulty filling positions,
an exception to the supervision restriction above may be allowed. In this
circumstance, every effort will be made by the Mayor to restructure the
department in order to remove the family members from family member
supervision. Documented justification for hiring the family member is required

me at [official email address] or contact me at [phone number], I look forward
to speaking to you.”
   (G)   Elected officials shall not discuss issues pending before the Council.
Elected officials may seek public input but shall not respond to comments.
Engaging in substantive conversations on social media could require retention
of the posts and may violate the Open Meetings Act if other elected officials
are also engaging in the discussion.

City of Morehead Employee Handbook.

Board shall forward within ten (10) working days to each officer or employee of
the city or city agency who is the subject of the complaint a copy of the
complaint and a general statement of the applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The Ethics Board may, on its own initiative, determine through an
inquiry into informal allegations, or information provided directly to the
Ethics Board, by referral, by coverage in the public news media, or otherwise
that a violation of this code may exist and prepare a complaint of its own. The
Ethics Board may also amend a complaint that has been filed with it by adding
further allegations, by adding respondents involved in the same conduce,
directly or indirectly and by action or inaction, or by deleting allegations
that have been made against person or entities not covered by this code, or by
deleting allegations that do appear to be supported by the facts. The Ethics
Board may also consolidate complaints where the allegations are materially
related. Amended complaints must be sent to the complainant and respondent by
the Ethics Board.
   (C)   Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of a proper complaint, the
Ethics Board shall conduct a preliminary inquiry concerning the allegations
contained in the complaint. The Ethics Board shall afford a person who is the

with the Ethics Board a response to the complaint with thirty (30) days after
the receipt of the complaint. The response, if any, must be sent to the person
filing the original complaint (complainant) by the Ethics Board within five (5)
days after its filing. Within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the complainant
may also file with the Ethics Board a response to the respondent’s response,
which the Ethics Board must send to the respondent within five (5) days after
its filing.
   (E)   Extensions of time to any of the time limitations specified in this
section may be granted by the Ethics Board upon a vote of the majority of the
members. If no meeting can be held before such time limit runs, the chair may
extend the time frame until the following meeting. The Ethics Board must give
written notice of any extension(s) of time to the respondent and the
complainant.
   (F)   All proceedings and records relating to a preliminary inquiry being
conducted by the Ethics Board shall be confidential until a final determination

County Attorney evidence which may be used in criminal proceedings.

existence of a preliminary inquiry, the Ethics Board may publicly confirm the
existence of the inquiry, and, at its discretion, make public any documents
which were issued by either party.
   (G)   The Ethics Board shall make a determination based on its preliminary
inquiry whether the complaint is within its jurisdiction and, if so, whether it
alleges a minimal factual basis to constitute a probable cause as to a
violation of this chapter. If the Ethics Board concludes that the complaint is
outside of its jurisdiction, frivolous or without factual basis, the Board
shall immediately terminate the inquiry, reduce the conclusion to writing, and
transmit a copy of its decision to the complainant and to all officers or
employees against whom the complaint was filed.
   (H)   If the Ethics Board concludes, based upon its preliminary inquiry,
that the complaint is within its jurisdiction and contains allegations
sufficient to establish a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation, the
Ethics Board shall notify the officer or employee who is the subject of the
complaint and may initiate a hearing to determine whether there has been a
violation.
   (I)   If a complaint is accepted or prepared pursuant to this chapter, the
Ethics Board must conduct an investigation. From this point on, the complainant
may not withdraw his or her complaint, although he or she may request that the
Ethics Board either make a finding of no probable cause or not violation.
   (J)   In conducting an investigation, the Ethics Board may administer oaths
or affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, and require the
production of any books or records it deems relevant and material. The Police
Department and all city agencies, bodies, officials, and employees are required
to respond fully and truthfully to all inquiries and cooperate with all
requests of the Ethics Board in the course of an investigation or a public
hearing, except to the extent that such denial is required by federal, state or
local law.
   (K)   Nothing in this section may be construed to permit the Ethics Board to
conduct an investigation of itself or of any of its members or staff. If the
Ethics Board receives a complaint alleging that the Ethics Board, or any of its
members or staff has violated any provision of this Code, or any other law, the
Ethics Board must promptly transmit to City Council.
   (L)   Any person who knowingly files with the Ethics Board a false complaint
alleging a violation of any provision of this chapter by an officer or employee
of the city or any city agency shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.

(Ord. 20:2024, passed 9-18-24)
§ 50.04 ACCUMULATION OF GARBAGE AND REFUSE; RULES.
   The following rules and regulations shall govern the accumulation of garbage
and refuse:
   (A) Tipper cans. It shall be the duty of owners, tenants, or persons in
charge of every dwelling, store, manufacturing establishment, office building,
or other structure in the city to place or cause to be placed all garbage and
refuse accumulating on the premises in tipper cans of sufficient size and
quantity to properly hold all garbage or refuse generated at that location.
Tipper cans shall be those tipper cans provided by the city as detailed in
division (B) below. Tipper cans shall be of nonrusting, watertight, rigid
plastic, of a substantial construction with tight-fitting covers sufficient to
keep out water, prevent disturbance by animals, and the entrance of insects.
The tipper cans shall not have a capacity of more than ninety-five (95)
gallons. Any collection of garbage or refuse that does not comply with the
requirements of this section shall be collected only at the discretion of the
director of public works.
   (B)   The city shall provide each residence a ninety-five (95) gallon
wheeled tipper can into which residents are required to place garbage. If more
than one (1) tipper can is needed, the city will provide one (1) additional
tipper can for a fee of three dollars ($3.00) per month for the additional
tipper can. Each residence as defined in §
50.01(F) is limited to two (2) tipper cans per residence.
      (1)   Each city provided tipper can is serial numbered and is issued to a
specific address and person. Said tipper can shall not be removed from the
assigned premises. If the resident moves, the resident shall contact the
Department of Public Works to return the tipper can.
      (2)   The tipper can remains the property of the City of Morehead. The
tipper can shall not be painted, abused, mutilated, altered or modified in any
manner. If the tipper can is damaged beyond repair, the resident will be held
responsible for replacement costs of the tipper can.
      (3)   If a resident's tipper can is stolen, the resident is required to
report the tipper can stolen immediately to the Department of Public Works.
Failure to immediately report may delay the replacement of the tipper can.
      (4)   The tipper can lid shall be kept closed at all times, except when
placing household garbage in the tipper can. This prevents water from entering,
placing unnecessary weight on the tipper can. It also prevents trash from
blowing out and entry of insects.
      (5)   The following items shall not be placed in the tipper can: paint,
gasoline, solvents, oils, liquids of any kind, hot ashes, hot charcoal,
batteries, tires, hazardous wastes, bricks, blocks, building or construction
material or any other items not normally found in household garbage. Contents
of tipper cans shall be limited to normal household refuse which shall be
placed in garbage bags.
      (6)   Tipper cans shall be kept clean and in good condition. Tipper cans
shall be maintained in good condition and shall be kept clean by the resident.
      (7)   If a tipper can is in need of repair, the resident should contact
the Department of Public Works. The Department of Public Works shall make
repairs due to normal wear and tear on a tipper can at no charge. The resident
will be responsible for the cost of repairs to or replacement of a tipper can
due to neglect, abuse or destruction.
      (8)   Location of tipper cans for collection. Garbage or solid waste in
proper tipper cans shall be set out curbside on collection days on the sidewalk
or curb at any location fronting on a dedicated public way which has been
accepted by the city or which is maintained by any governmental unit. All
tipper cans must be placed along the curb or sidewalk as described above before
pick up unless another location has been specifically approved by the Director
of Public Works in writing. Tipper cans placed on the curb or sidewalk shall be
promptly removed therefrom after they have been emptied.
   (C) Bulk containers. It shall be the duty of owners, tenants, or persons in
charge of every dwelling, store, manufacturing establishment, office building,
or other structure in the city to provide a bulk container for the storage or
holding of garbage or refuse which cannot reasonably be held or stored in the
tipper cans identified in divisions (A) and (B) above. Permitted under this
section are containers commonly known as Demster-Dumpster or containers with
similar design. Bulk containers shall not be used by more than one dwelling,
store, manufacturing establishment, office building, or other structure without
the prior written consent of the director of public works. Any collection of
garbage or refuse that does not comply with the requirements of this section
shall be collected only at the discretion of the director of public works. Bulk
containers shall be maintained in good condition.
   (D) Scattering of garbage prohibited. No person shall throw, place, or
discard garbage or other refuse in any street or other public place or on any
public or private property except in proper waste containers. No person shall
upset or turn the contents of any garbage container on any street, sidewalk,
alley, or other public place.
   (E)   Removal of garbage from containers. No person, other than the city or
other authorized garbage collection service, shall remove any garbage from any
container which has been set out for collection without the consent of the
occupant, owner, or manager of the premises, unless specifically authorized in
writing to do so by the Director of Public Works.
   (F)   Enclosures, sheds, storage or corrals. Enclosures sheds, storage or
corrals, whether made or utilized for concealing and/or containing tipper cans
or bulk containers (including dumpsters), shall not be used without the prior
written consent of the Director of Public Works. Any collection of garbage or
refuse that does not comply with the requirements of this section shall be
collected only at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.

is not a holiday. If the entire bill is not paid by the fifth (5th) day of the
month following the due date, (approximately thirty-five (35) days), then
pursuant to authority of KRS 96.934, the water service connection to the
premises shall be disconnected, (locked-off). If any delinquent customer shall,
thereafter, desire reconnection, a charge in the sum of thirty-two dollars
($32) is fixed to cover the expense thereof; and prior to reconnection, the
customer shall be required to pay the delinquent bill, the penalty, and the
charge for reconnection. If the water services are reconnected by the customer,
a charge of thirty-five dollars ($35) will be placed on the customer's account
to cover the expense of an additional trip and to replace a broken lock.
Whether or not any premises are disconnected because of a delinquency, the City
Attorney or any attorney duly authorized to act for and by the city, is
authorized and directed to enforce and collect the amount of any bills
remaining delinquent for thirty (30) days after the penalty is added (including
the penalty, six percent (6%) interest from the date the penalty is added, and
court costs) by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.

building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway. The sewer
from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any
obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any single
connection aforementioned.
   (B)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and testing by the General Superintendent
or his designee, to meet all requirements of this chapter. If the old service
is determined to not be suitable for further use, the owner shall pay the cost
for a new permit, tap or services as may be required to serve the new building.
Permit and inspection fees for new buildings using existing building sewers
shall be the same as for new building sewers. If additional sewer customers are
added to the old building sewers, additional sewer tap fees shall be charged
accordingly even though no new sewer tap is actually made into the city system.
   (C)   Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customer's
side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than that of the
customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be permitted.
   (D)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM A-74, latest
revision, PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) sewer pipe, ASTM D-3034, latest revision,
unglazed clay sewer pipe, ASTM C-261, latest revision, vitrified clay sewer
pipe, ASTM C-700, latest revision, or ductile iron pipe, AWWA Specification C-
151 cement lined, and shall meet requirements of the state plumbing code.
Joints shall be as set out hereinafter. Any part of the building sewer that is
located within five feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed with cast
iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe, unless the building sewer is at least one
foot deeper in the ground than the water service line. In the latter case,
vitrified clay pipe may be used. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe may
be required by the city where the building sewer is exposed to damage or
stoppage by tree roots. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe shall be used
in filled or unstable ground, in areas where the cover over the building sewer
is less than three feet, or in areas where the sewer is subject to vehicular or
other external loads.
   (E)   The size, slope, alignment, and materials used in the construction of
a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the
pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the
requirements of the local and state building and plumbing codes and other
applicable rules and regulations of the city.
   (F)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall
indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. Fees for connection shall
be as established by the city.
   (G)   The owner shall ensure that all excavation for building sewer
installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the city.
   (H)   In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the same building sewer.
Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary drainage shall be above the
basement floor or in separately watertight or drained sump or channel.
   (I)   The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the
easement or property line. Where no properly located service branch is
available, an authorized agent of the city shall cut a neat hole into the main
line of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle installed to receive
the building sewer. The invert of the building sewer at such point of
connection with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant of the main line of the
public sewer. A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner
surface of the public sewer, shall be made and the saddle made secure and
watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A
wye and H bend fitting shall be installed at the property line between the
public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a
cleanout and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After
testing, a cast iron or ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and
brought flush with the ground surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type
joint applicable to the pipe used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion
of ground or surface water.
   (J)   All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet or
exceed the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code.
   (K)   All persons working on city sewers with a cleaning rod must use an
approved type rod in cleaning sewer connections to city sewers.
   (L)   Sewer taps shall not be allowed for structures where the lowest floor
to be connected to the sewer is below the surface level of the nearest existing
downstream manhole cover.
   (M)   Property owners shall be responsible for maintaining sewer lines,
including sewer taps, from the building connection to the main sewer lines in
all instances where a clean out is not provided at the end of the tap at the
property line, or to the service branch on the public sewer where such public
sewer exists within an easement on private property.

§ 52.28 INSPECTION.
   (A)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the General
Superintendent when the building sewer is ready for connection to the public
sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the General
Superintendent or his representative. The connections shall be made gastight
and watertight and verified by proper testing.
     (B)   All building sewers shall be smoke tested through the wye branch at
the public sewer connection, with public sewer tightly plugged off, after
connections at both ends are made and after all pipe is properly bedded and
backfilled at least to top of pipe and if backfill is completed, within two
weeks after completion of backfill. At time of test, any openings into the
building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any
leakage of smoke from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be
located at test and repaired to stand repetition of smoke test without leakage.
When smoke testing is completed, the temporary flow line plug shall be removed
and a permanent water tight plug shall be placed in branch of test wye-branch
and carefully backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six (6) inches above
the top of the branch.

POLLUTANT DISCHARGE LIMITS
§ 52.30 GENERAL CONDITIONS.
   The following described substances, materials, waters, or wastes shall be
limited in discharges to the Morehead sanitary sewer system to concentrations
or quantities which: (i) will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment
process or equipment, (ii) will maintain and protect water quality in the
receiving stream, and (iii) will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public
property, or constitute a nuisance. The General Superintendent may set
additional limitations or limitations more stringent than those established in
the regulations below if in his opinion such more severe limitations are
necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming his opinion as to the
acceptability of a discharge, the General Superintendent shall give
consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to
flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers,
the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment
plant, and other pertinent factors.

   (D)   General discharge permits. The General Manager may issue a general
discharge permit to any user who, in the opinion of the General Manager, has a
potential to cause harm to the POTW and/or endanger POTW personnel or the
general public. Users required by the General Manager to obtain such a permit
shall complete an application with the MUPB in the form prescribed by the
General Manager. Users regulated by a general discharge permit are subject to
all provisions of this chapter. The general discharge permits may contain all
the provisions as listed for industrial user permits in §
52.48. The General Manager may use general discharge permits to control
discharges to the POTW if the following conditions are met. All facilities to
be covered by a general permit must:
      (1)   Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
      (2)   Discharge the same types of wastes;
      (3)   Require the same effluent limitations;
      (4)   Require the same or similar monitoring; and
      (5)   In the opinion of the General Manager, are more appropriately
controlled under a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge
permits.

§ 52.49 ALTERNATIVE DISCHARGE LIMITS.
   (A)   Where an effluent from a categorical industrial process(es) is mixed
prior to treatment with wastewater other than that generated by the regulated
process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge
permit by the General Superintendent. These alternative limits shall be applied
to the mixed effluent and shall be calculated using the Combined Wastestream
Formula and/or Flow-Weighted Average Formula as defined in §
52.02.
   (B)   Where the effluent limits in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production
(production-based standard), the General Superintendent may convert the limits
to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per
day or of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent permit
limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be subject to all
permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully
comply with these alternative limits.
   (C)   All categorical users subject to production-based standards must
report production rates annually so that alternative permit limits can be
calculated if necessary. The categorical industrial user must notify the
General Superintendent thirty (30) days in advance of any major change in
production levels that will affect the limits for the discharge permit.
(Ord. 14:95, passed 5-25-95; Am. Ord. 5:96, passed 3-12-96)
§ 52.50 PERMIT DURATION.
   Industrial user permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to
exceed five (5) years. A permit may be issued for a period less than one (1)
year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for
permit reissuance a minimum of sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the
user's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject
to modification by the city during the term of the permit as limitations or
requirements as identified in §§
52.30 -
52.39 are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of
any proposed changes in their permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the
effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall
include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
(Ord. 14:95, passed 5-25-95; Am. Ord. 5:96, passed 3-12-96)
§ 52.51 PERMIT TRANSFER.
   Industrial user permits are issued to a specific user for a specific
operation. An industrial user permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or
sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed
operation without a thirty (30) day prior notification to the General
Superintendent and provision of a copy of the existing permit to the new owner.
The General Superintendent may deny the transfer of the permit if it is deemed
necessary.

§ 52.52 COMPLIANCE DATA REPORTING.
   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards or, in the case of a new user,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into POTW, any user
subject to Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall
submit to the General Manager a report indicating the nature and concentration
of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited
by Categorical Pretreatment Standards and Requirements and the average and
maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are
limited by such Categorical Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. The report
shall state whether the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional
pretreatment and time schedule is necessary to bring the user into compliance
with the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user. Where
compliance schedules are required, the following conditions shall apply:
   (A)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
   (B)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
   (C)   The user shall submit a progress report to the General Manager no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule.

§ 52.53 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   All significant industrial users shall submit, to the General Manager,
every six (6) months or on dates specified in the industrial user permit,
unless required more frequently by the permit, a report indicating, at a
minimum, the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by Pretreatment Standards or the discharge permit. The report shall
also include the chain-of-custody (COC) forms, field data and any other
information required by the General Manager. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all daily flows or the average daily flow. At the
discretion of the General Manager and in consideration of such factors as local
high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the General Manager may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
40 CFR 403.12 and § 52.61 of this chapter.
   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge. All analyses shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to
the MUPB. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures
established by the U.S. EPA Administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act
and contained in 40 CFR Part 136, and amendments thereto and 40 CFR 261 or with
any other test procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator. Sampling
shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the U.S. EPA
Administrator. Except as indicated in sections (a) and (b) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the General Manager. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the General Manager, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and sulfides the samples
may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and
oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite
samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the General
Manager, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous limits. (a) Samples for oil and grease,
temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides and volatile organic
compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. (b) For sampling
required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports
required in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must
be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
General Manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by 40
CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial user is required to collect the number of
grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
   (C)   Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique
for the pollutant(s) in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, "Sampling and
Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority
Pollutants", April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and
analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
   (D)   A Baseline Monitoring Report (BMR) must be submitted to the General
Manager by all categorical industrial users at least ninety (90) days prior to
initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. The BMR must contain, at a
minimum, the following:
      (1)   Production data: a process description, SIC code number, raw
materials used, chemicals used, final product, pretreatment industrial category
(if applicable), and a schematic which indicates points of discharge to the
sewer system.
      (2)   Identifying information to include name, address of facility, owner
(s), contact person and any other permits held by the facility.
      (3)   Wastewater characteristics: total plant flow, types of discharges,
average and maximum flows from each process.
      (4)   Nature/concentration of pollutants: analytical results for all
pollutants regulated by this chapter and/or any applicable federal pretreatment
standard and sample type and location. All analyses must conform with 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto.
      (5)   Information concerning any pretreatment equipment used to treat the
facility's discharge.
      (6)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative as defined in § 52.02 and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether Pretreatment Standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance
(O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the Pretreatment
Standards and Requirements.
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the Pretreatment Standards, the shortest schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable Pretreatment
Standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in § 52.52 of this chapter.
   (E)   New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in
sections (3) and (4) above, but at no time shall a new source commence
discharge(s) to the public sewer of substances that do not meet provisions of
this chapter. All new sources must be in compliance with all provisions of this
chapter, state and federal pretreatment regulations prior to commencement of
discharge to the public sewer.
   (F)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to all compliance schedules required by this chapter:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable Pretreatment Standards;
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the General Manager no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and in no event
shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the
General Manager.
   (G)   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and
documentation associated with Best Management Practices as may be required.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for
a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall automatically be
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the MUPB or
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention by the
General Manager.

§ 52.55 MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The city may require significant users to provide and operate, at the
user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and
flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage system. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in a public right-of-way. The
General Superintendent shall review and approve the location, plans, and
specifications for such monitoring facilities and may require them to be
constructed to provide for the separate monitoring and sampling of industrial
waste and sanitary sewage flows.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near the sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility shall be designed and maintained in a manner such that the safety of
city and industrial personnel shall be foremost. The facility, sampling, and
measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days
following approval of the location, plans and specifications.
   (D)   All sampling analyses done in accordance with approved federal EPA
procedures by the industrial user during a reporting period shall be submitted
to the General Superintendent, regardless of whether or not sampling analyses
were required by the significant industrial user's discharge permit.
   (E)   A significant industrial user must receive the approval of the General
Superintendent before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring facilities
to be used in all required sampling.

the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the General Superintendent or his representative ready
access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, copying records, records examination, or in the
performance of any of their duties.
   (B)   The city, Approval Authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, Approval Authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific
responsibilities.

as specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. The city may require the
development of a compliance schedule for installation of pretreatment
technology and/or equipment by any industrial user that cannot meet discharge
limits required by this chapter. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater
to a level required by this chapter shall be provided, operated, and maintained
at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be
acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.90 GENERAL.
   (A)   The city, through the General Superintendent or his designee, to
insure compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40 CFR Subchapter
N, and 401 KAR 5:057, may take the following enforcement steps against users in
non-compliance with the chapter. The remedies available to the POTW include
injunctive relief, civil and criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of
discharges and/or water service and the publishing of the list of significant
industrial users in significant noncompliance annually. The enforcement
authority shall be vested in the General Superintendent or his designee.
   (B)   The General Superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment
service, an industrial user permit and/or a hauled waste discharge permit when
suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the General Superintendent, in order
to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to
the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate
any condition of its NPDES/KPDES Permit.
   (C)   Any user notified of a suspension of wastewater treatment service, its
industrial user permit and/or its hauled waste discharge permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of
the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take
such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, the collection system
and/or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall reinstate the industrial
user permit, wastewater treatment service and/or the hauled waste discharge
permit upon receiving proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge.
A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence
shall be submitted to the city within fifteen (15) days of the date of
occurrence.
   (D)   In the event of termination of service, the significant industrial
user shall pay the MUPB for all costs incurred to perform the disconnection and
reconnection of service plus fifteen percent (15%) administrative costs prior
to the service being restored. If actual costs cannot be determined, the costs
shall be estimated by the General Superintendent.
   (E)   The enforcement actions and remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The General Manager may take any, all, or combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the MUPB's Enforcement Response Plan.
However, the General Manager may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the General Manager is empowered to take more
than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

§ 52.91 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Any user found to be violating any provisions of this chapter,
industrial user permit, or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be
served by the city with written notice stating the nature of the violation(s).
Within ten (10) days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the General
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
potential liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation.
   (B)   If the violations persist or the explanation and/or plan are not
adequate, the city's response shall be more formal and commitments (or
schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in an
administrative order. The enforcement response selected will be related to the
seriousness of the violation and will be as outlined in the Enforcement
Response Plan. Enforcement responses will be escalated if compliance is not
achieved expeditiously after the initial action. Identification of significant
non-compliance as defined in §
52.59 will require a formal enforcement action.
   (C)   The full scale of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the
Enforcement Response Plan (ERP).
(Ord. 14:95, passed 5-25-95; Am. Ord. 5:96, passed 3-12-96)
§ 52.92 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS.
   (A)   Any user who after receiving a notice of violation shall continue to
discharge in violation of this chapter or other pretreatment standards or
requirements or is determined to be in significant noncompliance, shall be
ordered to appear before the General Superintendent. At the appearance, a
compliance schedule will be given to the noncompliant user and an
administrative fine assessed. The fine shall be determined on a case-by-case
basis which shall consider the type and severity of violations, duration of
violations, number of violations, severity of impact on the POTW, impact on
human health, users economic benefit from the violations, history of
violations, good faith of the user, and shall be a non-arbitrary but
appropriate amount.
   (B)   Users desiring to dispute such fines shall file with the General
Superintendent a request for the Morehead Utility Plant Board to reconsider the
fine. This appeal must be filed within ten (10) days of the date of being
notified of the fine. The Morehead Utility Plant Board shall convene a hearing
on the matter within fifteen (15) days of receiving such a request from the
user. The decision of the Morehead Utility Plant Board shall be final.
   (C)   The administrative order may take any of the following three forms.
      (1)   Consent orders. The General Superintendent or his designee is
hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the
industrial user responsible for the non-compliance. The orders will include
specific actions to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a
time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same
force and effect as orders issued pursuant to §
52.92.
      (2)   Compliance Orders. When the General Superintendent or his designee
finds that a user has violated or continues to violate the chapter or a permit
or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user
responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances and equipment have been
installed and are properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain such
other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address
the non-compliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology,
additional self-monitoring, and management practices.
      (3)   Cease and Desist Orders. When the General Superintendent finds that
a user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, the General Superintendent may issue an order to cease and
desist all such violations and direct the user in non-compliance to:
         (a)   comply forthwith, or
         (b)   take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.

causes or contributes to violations of this chapter, or permit or order issued
hereunder, an order to appear and show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place of a hearing to be held by the General Superintendent regarding
the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed
enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause, before the
Superintendent, why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or
not a duly user or its authorized representative appears, immediate enforcement
action may be pursued by the General Superintendent.
   (B)   The General Superintendent, himself, conduct the hearing and take the
evidence, or designate a representative to:
      (1)   Issue, in the name of the city, notices of hearings requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in such hearing;

reimbursement is called a "tap fee" and constitutes a separate charge.
      (2)   An impact fee does not include fees assessed or collected as part
of a local improvement district or a charge in lieu of a local improvement
district assessment, or the cost of complying with requirements or conditions
imposed by a land use decision.
   (G)   "LAND AREA." The area of a parcel of land as measured by projection of

subject of the development approval; or
         (b)   Located in whole or in part on or contiguous to a parcel of land
that is the subject of the development approval.
      (3)   For purposes of this definition, contiguous means in a public way
which abuts the parcel.
   (N)   "REDEVELOPMENT." Repurposing an existing structure.
   (O)   "SYSTEM WIDE IMPROVEMENTS FEE." A fee for costs associated with
capital improvements constructed or under construction on the date the fee is

(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.102 IMPACT FEE ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   Unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of this subchapter or
other local or state law, an impact fee is hereby imposed upon all development,
redevelopment or new customer within MUPB's service area, upon the act of
making a connection to MUPB's wastewater facilities.
   (B)   The impact fee shall be established and may be revised by resolution
of MUPB. The resolution shall set the amount of the charge, the type of permit
to which the fee applies, and, if the fee applies to a geographic area smaller
than the entire wastewater service area, the geographic area subject to the
charge.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.103 METHODOLOGY.
   (A)   The impact fee shall be calculated as follows: system wide improvement
fee (per gallon) + growth related expansion fee (per gallon) = total impact fee
per gallon. The total impact fee per gallon shall be offset by existing
outstanding debt credit resulting in a net impact fee per gallon. Net impact
fee per gallon shall be multiplied by the average waste water usage per
Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) resulting in the net impact fee per ERU. The
impact fee is arrived by multiplying the net impact fee per ERU by the ERU of
the new development.
   (B)   The methodology used to establish or modify the system wide
improvements fee shall, where applicable, be based on the current outstanding
debt allocated to the facilities including without limitation design, financing
and construction costs, prior contributions by then-existing users, gifts or
grants from federal or state government or private persons, the volume of
unused capacity available to future system users, rate-making principals
employed to finance publicly-owned capital improvements, and other relevant
factors identified by MUPB. The methodology shall promote the objective that
future system users shall contribute no more or less than an equitable share of
the cost of then-existing facilities.
   (C)   The methodology used to establish or modify the growth-related
expansion fee shall, where applicable, demonstrate consideration of the
estimated cost of projected capital improvements needed to increase the
capacity of the systems to which the fee is related. The methodology shall be
calculated to obtain the cost of capital improvements for the projected need
for available system capacity for future system users.
   (D)   Equivalent residential unit, with the acronym ERU, shall be the basis
of assigning an impact fee charge. The ERU shall be established on the basis of
the average residential water usage in MUPB's service area, and serves as an
estimation of the gallons of wastewater discharged daily to MUPB's wastewater
facilities by a single-family residence. The impact fee is calculated by
calculation of outstanding debt, future debt and administrative fees to
establish the net impact fee (per gallon). The net impact fee (per gallon) is
multiplied by the estimation of the average residential water usage (in gallons
per day) equaling the net impact fee (per ERU). The ERU shall be calculated
specific to the Morehead Utility Plant Board. At a minimum, the ERU should be
recalculated every five (5) years.
   (E)   The equation and factors used to establish or modify the system wide
improvements fee, the growth-related expansion fee, or both, shall be contained
in a resolution adopted by MUPB.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.104 AUTHORIZED EXPENDITURES.
   (A)   System wide improvements fees shall be applied only to capital
improvements associated with the system for which the fees are assessed,
including expenditures relating to repayment of indebtedness.
   (B)   (1)   Growth-related expansion fees shall be spent only on capacity-
increasing capital improvements associated with the system for which the fee is
assessed, including expenditures relating to repayment of future debt for the
improvements. An increase in system capacity occurs if a capital improvement
increases the level of performance or service provided by existing facilities
or by providing new facilities.
      (2)   The portion of the capital improvements funded by growth-related
expansion fees must be related to demands created by current or projected
development. A capital improvement being funded wholly or in part from revenues
derived from the growth-related expansion fee shall be included in the plan
adopted by MUPB pursuant to §
52.106.
   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) above, impact fee revenues may
be expended on the direct costs of complying with the provisions of this
subchapter, including the costs of developing impact fee methodologies and
providing an annual accounting of impact fee expenditures.
   (D)   There shall be created a restricted account entitled the "wastewater
impact fee account." All monies derived from the wastewater impact fee shall be
placed in the wastewater impact fee account. Funds in the wastewater impact fee
account shall be used solely to provide the wastewater capital improvements
plan (CIP) listed capacity increasing improvements according to the wastewater
CIP as it currently exists or as hereinafter adopted and amended, and eligible
administrative costs. In this regard, wastewater impact fee revenues may be
used for purposes that include:
      (1)   Design and construction plan preparation;
      (2)   Permitting;
      (3)   Right-of-way acquisition, including any costs of acquisition and
condemnation;
      (4)   Construction of new wastewater treatment facilities, including, but
not limited to, sludge handling facilities;
      (5)   Construction of collection and interceptor lines;
      (6)   Construction of pumping and lift stations;
      (7)   Demolition that is part of the construction of any of the
improvements on this list;
      (8)   Payment of principal and interest, necessary reserves and costs of
issuance under any bonds or other indebtedness issued by MUPB (including those
issued by and through the City of Morehead) to provide money to construct or
acquire wastewater facilities; and
      (9)   Direct costs of complying with the provisions of the Kentucky
Revised Statutes that allows or limits impact fees/SDCs, including the costs of
developing impact fee methodologies and providing an annual accounting of
impact fee expenditures.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.105 EXPENDITURE RESTRICTIONS.
   Impact fee charges shall not be expended for costs of the operation or
routine maintenance of capital improvements.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.106 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN.
   (A)   After the establishment of a wastewater impact fee, MUPB shall adopt a
capital improvements plan that includes a list of:
      (1)   The capital improvements that MUPB intends to fund in whole or in
part with impact fee revenues;
      (2)   The estimated cost and beginning date of construction of each
improvement and the percentage of that cost eligible to be funded with growth-
related expansion fee revenues; and
      (3)   A description of the process for modifying the plan.
   (B)   In adopting this plan, MUPB may incorporate by reference all or a
portion of any public facilities plan, master plan, capital improvements plan
or similar plan that contains the information required by this section.
   (C)   MUPB may modify such plan and list at any time. If the impact fee will
be increased by a proposed modification to the list, to include a capacity-
increasing public improvement, MUPB will:
      (1)   At least thirty (30) days prior to adoption of the proposed
modification, provide written notice to persons who have requested notice
pursuant to §
52.111; and
      (2)   Hold a public hearing if a written request for a hearing is
received within seven (7) days of the date of the proposed modification.
   (D)   A change in the amount of a system wide improvements fee or a growth-
related expansion fee is not a modification of the impact fee if the change in
amount is based on the periodic application of the Engineering News-Record's
(ENR) construction cost index or a modification to any of the factors related
to the rate that are incorporated in the established methodology. MUPB may
elect to revise the impact fee, annually, based upon changes in the ENR
construction cost index.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.107 COLLECTION OF WASTEWATER IMPACT FEE CHARGE.
   (A)   The wastewater impact fee is payable upon:
      (1)   MUPB approval of development plat for development;
      (2)   A request for wastewater service; or
      (3)   At the time tap fee(s) are collected, whichever is earliest.
   (B)   If no building, development, or connect permit is required, the impact
fee is payable at the time the usage of the capital improvement is increased
based on changes in the use of the property unrelated to seasonal or orderly
fluctuations in usage.
   (C)   If development is commenced or connection is made to the wastewater
facilities without an appropriate permit, the impact fee is immediately payable
upon the earliest date that a permit was required.
   (D)   If requested by the applicant, MUPB may provide the applicant an
estimate of the impact fee when a permit that allows building or development of
a parcel is issued.
   (E)   The impact fee program administrator shall not issue such permit or
allow such connection until the fee has been paid in full, or until provision
for installment payments has been made pursuant to §
52.108, or unless an exemption is granted pursuant to §
52.109.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.108 INSTALLMENT PAYMENT.
   (A)   When an impact fee based on an ERU number exceeding one hundred fifty
(150) units or more is due and collectible, the owner of the parcel of land
subject to the impact fee may apply for payment in six (6) semi-annual
installments, to include interest (at two (2) points above the prime rate at
the time of request) on the unpaid balance which shall be secured by a lien on
the parcel subject to the impact fee and/or other collateral, guarantee or
surety approved by MUPB.
   (B)   The impact fee program administrator shall provide application forms
for installment payments, which shall include a waiver of all rights to contest
validity of the lien, except for the correction of computational errors.
   (C)   An applicant for installment payments shall have the burden of
demonstrating the applicant's authority to assent to the imposition of a lien
on the parcel and that the property interest of the applicant and/or other
collateral, guarantee, or surety is adequate and enforceable to secure payment
of the lien.
   (D)   MUPB shall record the lien for the unpaid portion of the impact fee
charge. From that time MUPB shall have a lien upon the described parcel for the
amount of the impact fee charge, together with interest on the unpaid balance
at the rate established by MUPB. The lien shall be enforceable in all manner
permitted by law including but not limited to contract and/or KRS 376.265.
   (E)   For property that has been subject to a cancellation of assessment of
impact fees, a new installment payment contract shall be subject to the code
provisions applicable to impact fees and installment payment contracts on file
on the date the new contract is received by MUPB.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.109 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   MUPB shall have the authority in its discretion to waive, reduce or
fully enforce the impact fee for any entity or person.
   (B)   Additions to single-family dwellings that do not constitute the
addition of a dwelling unit, as defined by the Kentucky Uniform Building Code,
are exempt from all portions of the wastewater impact fee.
   (C)   An alteration, addition, replacement or change in use that does not
increase the use of the wastewater utility and its facilities are exempt from
all portions of the impact fee charge.
   (D)   Existing customers located within a development that have a current
wastewater service at the time of the adoption of this section by MUPB.
   (E)   All new residential dwellings not defined as being a part of a
development per local planning and zoning, subdivision regulations or local
ordinances in the jurisdiction of the property.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.110 CREDITS.
   (A)   When a redevelopment occurs that is subject to an impact fee, the
impact fee for the existing use, if applicable, shall be calculated and if it
is less than the impact fee for the use that will result from the development,
the difference between the impact fee for the existing use and the impact fee
for the proposed use shall be the impact fee charged. If the change in the use
results in the impact fee for the proposed use being less than the impact fee
for the existing use, no impact fee shall be required. No refund or credit
shall be given unless provided for by this subchapter.
   (B)   A credit shall be given to the permittee for the cost of a qualified
public improvement upon acceptance by MUPB. The credit shall not exceed the
growth-related expansion fee even if the cost of the capital improvement
exceeds the applicable growth-related expansion fee and shall only be for the
growth-related expansion portion of the impact fee charged for the type of
improvement being constructed.
   (C)   If a qualified public improvement is located in whole or in part on or
contiguous to the property that is the subject of the development approval and
is required by the General Manager to be built larger or with greater capacity
than is necessary for the particular development project, a credit shall be
given for the cost of the portion of the improvement that exceeds the City of
Morehead's or any other governmental or regulatory body's minimum standard
facility size or capacity needed to serve the particular development project or
property. The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that a
particular improvement qualifies for credit under this section. The request for
credit shall be filed in writing no later than sixty (60) days after acceptance
of the improvement plans by MUPB. MUPB may deny the credit provided for in this
section if MUPB demonstrates that the application does not meet the
requirements of this section or if the improvement for which the credit is
sought was not included in the improvement plan pursuant to §
52.106.
   (D)   When the construction of a qualified public improvement located in
whole or in part or contiguous to the property that is the subject of
development approval gives rise to a credit amount greater than the growth-
related expansion fee that would otherwise be levied against the project, the
credit in excess of the growth-related expansion fee for the original
development project may be applied against growth-related expansion fees that
accrue in subsequent phases of the original development project.
   (E)   When an existing customer, as defined in §
52.101, constructs, or causes to be constructed, a new development within
MUPB's wastewater utility service area, and abandons their existing residence
or establishment that is also located within MUPB's wastewater utility service
area, that customer may be granted a "buy-in" credit on their impact fee
charge. The buy-in credit serves to acknowledge the equity that the existing
customer has amassed in the wastewater utility. The credit is determined by
calculating only the system wide improvements portion of the impact fee using
the factors in place at the time of the customer's request for the credit. The
amount of the system wide improvements fee constitutes the amount of the buy-in
credit. To qualify for the buy-in credit:
      (1)   The ERU serving the new development must be equal to or less than
the ERU serving the existing account;
      (2)   The purpose of the new development must be essentially the same as
that of the existing account, i.e., single-family residence versus an existing
account assigned to a single-family residence;
      (3)   The existing water and wastewater account serving the existing
residence of establishment must be closed by request of the customer; and
      (4)   The customer must request the buy-in credit.
   (F)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) through (C) above, when establishing a
methodology for a wastewater impact fee charge, MUPB may provide for a credit
against the growth-related expansion fee, the system wide improvements fee, or
both, for capital improvements constructed as part of the development which
reduce the development's demand upon existing capital improvements and/or the
need for future capital improvements, or a credit based upon any other
rationale MUPB finds reasonable.
   (G)   Credits shall not be transferable from one development to another.
   (H)   Credits shall not be transferable from type (system wide improvement
or growth-related expansion) of impact fee to another.
   (I)   Credits shall be used within five (5) years from the date the credit
is given.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.111 NOTICE.
   (A)   MUPB shall maintain a list of persons who have made a written request
for notification prior to adoption or modification of a methodology for any
impact fee. Written notice shall be mailed to persons on the list at least
ninety (90) days prior to the first hearing to establish or modify an impact
fee charge. The methodology supporting the impact fee shall be available at
least thirty (30) days prior to the first hearing to adopt or amend an impact
fee. The failure of a person on the list to receive a notice that was mailed
does not invalidate the action of MUPB.
   (B)   MUPB may periodically delete names from the list, but at least thirty
(30) days prior to removing a name from the list, MUPB must notify the person
whose name is to be deleted that a new written request for notification is
required if the person wishes to remain on the notification list.

impact fee calculated and collected on account of the wastewater system shall
be used for no purpose other than set forth in §
52.104.
   (B)   MUPB shall provide the City Council with an annual accounting, by July
1 of each year, for impact fees showing the total and the projects funded from
each account in the previous fiscal year. A list of the amount spent on each
project funded, in whole or in part, with impact fee revenues shall be included
in the annual accounting.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.113 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Refunds may be given by the impact fee program administrator upon
finding that there was a clerical error in the calculation of the impact fee.
   (B)   Refunds shall not be allowed for failure to timely claim credit or for
failure to timely seek an alternative impact fee rate calculation at the time
of submission of an application for a building permit.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)

revenues, the MUPB Board shall direct that a sum equal to the misspent amount
shall be deposited within one year to the credit of the account or fund from
which it was spent.
   (D)   A legal action challenging the methodology adopted by the Council and
MUPB pursuant to §
52.103 shall not be filed later than sixty (60) days after adoption of such
methodology. A person shall contest the methodology used for calculating an
impact fee only as provided in §
52.103, and not otherwise.
   (E)   A person who wishes to challenge an impact fee must make a written
challenge to the fee and file the challenge with the General Manager within ten
(10) days of receiving the notification of charge. The written challenge must
describe with particularity the calculation that the person appeals.
      (1)   (a)   The written challenge shall state:
            1.   The name and address of the appellant; and
            2.   The nature of the appeal.
         (b)   Failure to file such written challenge within the time permitted
shall be considered a waiver of any objections to the charge.
      (2)   After providing timely notice to the challenger, the General
Manager shall determine whether the charge is in accordance with the resolution
containing the methodology used to establish or modify the impact fee adopted
by MUPB.
      (3)   Unless the challenger and MUPB agree to a longer period, a written
challenge to the impact fee shall be heard by the General Manager within ten

   (F)   After exhausting the MUPB's administrative review procedure pursuant
to division (E) above, the person challenging the impact fee may then petition
the Rowan Circuit Court to review the final determination within thirty (30)
days after the mailing of written notice of such decision.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)
§ 52.116 CHANGE IN ERU UNIT(S).
   If any customer of MUPB wastewater utility increases the ERU classification
of a property utilized to determine the customer's impact fee, that customer is
subject to a revised impact fee. The revised impact fee shall be the difference
in the fees associated with the existing and new ERU unit(s). This section
applies to any customer of the wastewater utility, not only those who have
previously paid an impact fee.
(Ord. 19:2024, passed - -24)

§ 55.03 EROSION PROTECTION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
   (A)   Purpose. The requirements set forth in this chapter are intended to:
      (1)   Control or eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation from
construction site stormwater runoff related to land disturbing activities
within the limits of the MUPB Service Area stormwater system;
      (2)   Control or eliminate waste from construction site operators that
may cause adverse impacts to water quality.
   (B)   Land disturbance activity.
      (1)   Any activity disturbing more than five thousand (5,000) square feet
of soil will require a land disturbance permit (LDP). A Type 1 LDP is required
for activities that disturb more than five thousand (5,000) square feet but
less than one (1) acre, provided the site isn't part of a larger development.
The Type 2 LDP is for development/redevelopment projects that disturb greater
than one (1) acre or are part of a larger development. MUPB may also require
projects that drain to environmentally sensitive areas to obtain a Type 2 LDP
and follow a plan meeting the Type 2 requirements.
      (2)   Unless determined to be a problem, the following activities are
exempt from obtaining a land disturbance permit and the provisions of this
chapter:
         (a)   Emergencies posing an immediate danger to life or property,

(garages, additions, porches, etc.).
      (3)   The Issuing Authority may on a project-by-project basis exempt
other minor land disturbance activities not specifically identified in the
exemptions above.
      (4)   Land disturbance activities on individual lots or parcels that are
part of a larger common plan of development are also subject to the provisions
of this chapter. In this situation, if the individual lot or parcel owner is
different than the permittee of the larger common plan of development, the
individual lot or parcel owner (i.e. builder) is responsible for complying with
the provisions of these regulations and is required to obtain a land
disturbance permit. The permittee of the larger plan of development is also
responsible for maintaining the conditions of the approved LDP for land
disturbance activity on the individual lot or parcel until eighty percent (80%)
build-out of the development is reached.
   (C)   EPSC requirements.
      (1)   Plan requirements. Sites where land disturbance activities are
proposed will require a land disturbance permit with the appropriate site
construction water quality protection plan approved by the Issuing Authority.
These plans shall be prepared by a licensed engineer, drawn to an appropriate
scale (as determined by MUPB) and shall include sufficient information to
evaluate the environmental characteristics of the affected areas, the potential
impacts of the proposed grading on water resources, and measures proposed to
minimize soil erosion and off-site sedimentation. The owner/developer/
contractor shall perform all clearing, grading, drainage, construction, and
development in strict accordance with the approved plan and these regulations.
      (2)   Design requirements. The design, testing, installation, and

deemed necessary to ensure an effective stormwater protection plan and shall
have the right to enter the property of the permittee without notice.
      (5)   The permittee shall prepare an inspection report after each
inspection and shall keep copies at the job site at all times. At a minimum the
inspection report shall include the date, time of day, name of the person
conducting the inspection, company represented, scope of the inspection, major
observations relating to the stormwater protection plan and BMPs installed, and
subsequent changes. A copy of each inspection report shall be filed with the
Issuing Authority. The Issuing Authority has the right to make regular
inspections to ensure the validity of the inspection reports.
      (6)   The permittee shall be self-policing and shall correct or remedy
any stormwater protection plan measures that are not effective or functioning
properly at all times during the various phases of construction.
   (F)   Enforcement.
      (1)   A fully qualified administrative official designated by the MUPB
shall enforce these regulations. This official may be from the MUPB Stormwater
Department or other duly authorized representative. A stop-work order may be
posted for the entire project or any specified part thereof if any of the
following conditions exist:
         (a)   Any land disturbance activity regulated under this chapter is
being undertaken without a land disturbance permit.
         (b)   The LDP stormwater protection plan is not being fully
implemented.
         (c)   Any of the conditions of the LDP stormwater protection plan are
not being met.
         (d)   LDP stormwater protection plan is determined to be ineffective.
      (2)   For the purposes of this section, a stop-work order is validly
posted by posting a copy of the stop-work order on the site of the land
disturbing activity in reasonable proximity to a location where the land
disturbing activity is taking place. Additionally, a copy of the order, in the
case of work for which there is a land disturbance permit, shall be mailed by
first class mail, postage pre-paid, to the address listed by the permittee on
the land disturbance permit. In the case of work for which there is no
authorized land disturbance permit, a copy of the order shall be mailed to the
person listed as the landowner of the property.
      (3)   If the permittee does not cease the activity or comply with the
stormwater protection plan or land disturbance permit conditions within five
(5) days of posting the stop-work order, the administrative official may revoke
the land disturbance permit.
      (4)   If the landowner or developer where no land disturbance permit has
been issued does not cease the land disturbance activity, the administrative
official may request MUPB's legal counsel to obtain injunctive relief.
      (5)   The administrative official may retract the revocation of the land
disturbance permit if the land disturbance activity and site is brought into
compliance with these regulations.
      (6)   If the public health, safety and nuisance is at stake time is of
the essence to perform any remedial clean-up work or other work to bring the
site into compliance with these regulations. In this situation, the Issuing
Authority may begin the work immediately without notice of intent and bill the
cost of such work to the permittee or landowner in violation. Example of this
type of work may include cleaning of mud, silt and sediment and other debris
from public streets and drainage systems.
      (7)   Any permittee, person, firm, corporation or agency acting as
principal, agent, employee or otherwise, who fails to comply with the
provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction
thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) and not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), or by
imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or both, for each separate
offense. Each day there is a violation of any part of this regulation shall
constitute a separate offense.
      (8)   If the permittee, landowner or developer fails to pay the amount
due for the remedial clean-up work or any other work to bring the site into
compliance with these regulations, MUPB shall have a lien upon the property
where the land disturbance activity and subsequent violation occurred for the
amount due which shall accrue interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per
annum and/or MUPB may include the amount due on the utility bill of the
permittee, landowner or developer.

or minimize water quality impacts from developments in the City of Morehead or
MUPB Stormwater Service Area; and
         (b)   To ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of BMPs.
      (2)   The primary objective of this chapter and the MUPB Stormwater
Program is to maintain after development, predevelopment stormwater runoff
characteristics; reduce stream bank and channel erosion, reduce siltation and
sedimentation in the community waters and waters of the Commonwealth and lower
the discharge of pollutants from impervious areas.
   (B)   Application. This chapter may apply to the development or
redevelopment of land for residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional
use, but does not apply to agricultural land management practices. Exemption of
agricultural land management practices does not apply to illicit discharges.
   (C)   Implementation of BMPs.
      (1)   The Approving Agency, Morehead Utility Plant Board, is responsible
for the implementation and enforcement of this chapter and the Stormwater
Management Program for the City of Morehead.
      (2)   The Approving Agency shall consider for implementation, but not be
limited to the following:
         (a)   Establishing policies, procedures, standards and criteria
relating to stormwater runoff quality and quantity;
         (b)   Creating a stormwater management guidance design manual and
standards for development and redevelopment projects that address quantitative
controls for increased volume and rate of surface runoff and qualitative
controls that reduce or eliminate pollutants carried by runoff;
         (c)   Creating an ordinance to address illicit discharges;
         (d)   Creating an ordinance to address erosion protection and sediment
control from construction site runoff related to land disturbing activities;
         (e)   Establishing design criteria and standards for construction site
waste control and erosion protection and sediment control related to land
disturbance activities; and
         (f)   Providing erosion protection and sediment control training for
city and Approving Agency staff.
   (D)   Stormwater management requirements.
      (1)   As the Approving Agency, Morehead Utility Plant Board has developed

employee failing to take appropriate steps required by this chapter shall be in
violation of this chapter.

steps required by this chapter.

may immediately notify his or her owner, manager, or supervisor of the
violation in satisfaction of the employee’s responsibility under this chapter.

the agencies or department authorized above to enforce this chapter informing
the agency or department of the circumstances of the violation.

establishment governed by this chapter does not constitute a violation on the
part of the establishment. The establishment and its agents shall only be
charged for a violation of this chapter if the responsible agent(s) of the
establishment fail to timely satisfy each responsibility prescribed for them in
this Section.

   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, net profit shall

      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) of this section.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation and the denominator of which the total compensation paid or
payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period. Compensation
is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s service is
performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sales, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property are apportioned to the city based upon a
fraction, the numerator of which is the time spent in performing such income-
producing activity within the city and the denominator of which is the total
time spent performing that income-producing activity.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
      (3)    The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will
fairly represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profits.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or service
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
“passed through” these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any table year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purpose of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually, on or before February 28 of each year, complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational

corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability,
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
subsection unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for,
or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes imposed

Officer may issue a citation without a notice of violation.
      (1)   If the citation is not contested by the person or corporation with

waive all or any portion of a penalty for an uncontested violation if, in its
discretion, the Code Enforcement Board determines that such waiver will promote
compliance with said ordinance:

addresses of said owners.
         (b)   In the event an adjacent property is a condominium or other type
of cooperative ownership then the person notified by mail shall be the
president or chairperson of the owner group which manages property commonly
owned by the cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two or more
co-owners of an adjoining property who are listed in the property valuation
administrator's records as having the same address.

shall be given to that unit's Planning Commission.
            2.   If the adjoining property is not part of a planning unit,
notice shall be given to the Mayor of the city in which the property is located
or, if the property is in an unincorporated area, notice shall be given to the
judge/executive of the county in which the property is located.
      (5)   Posted notice. A sign shall be posted in a conspicuous place, on
the subject property, and along the primary frontage of the property. The sign
shall notify the public of the pending request and shall provide information on
how to contact the city for more information. (Ord. 22:2019, passed 6-10-19)

§ 154.124 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Authority to continue and maintain. Passage of this code in no way
legalizes any illegal uses existing at the time of its adoption. Nonconforming
uses and structures may be as follows:
      (1)   Continuation of nonconforming use. A nonconforming use that
lawfully occupies a structure or a land site on the effective date of this code
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
standards and limitations in this section.
      (2)   Continuation of nonconforming structure. A nonconforming structure
that lawfully occupies a lot on the effective date of this code and that does
not conform with the standards for yards, buffers, height, gross floor area of
structures, driveways, open space, or other similar regulation for the district
in which the structure is located may be used and maintained, subject to the
standards and limitations in this section.
      (3)   Continuation of nonconforming accessory uses and structures. The
continued existence of nonconforming accessory uses, and structures is subject
to the provisions governing principal nonconforming uses and structures set
forth in this section.
      (4)   Maintenance, repair, and structural safety. Normal maintenance and
incidental repair may be performed on a conforming structure that contains a
nonconforming use or on a nonconforming structure.
   (B)   Nonconforming structure. A nonconforming structure may not be moved,
expanded, altered, except in the manner provided in this section or unless
required by law:
      (1)   Repair, maintenance, alterations, and expansions. A nonconforming
structure may be repaired, maintained, altered, or enlarged provided that any
enlargement of the nonconforming structure is in conformance with all
applicable zoning regulations for the district in which the property is
located. If the proposed enlargement does not conform with applicable
regulations, the owner shall first obtain approval of a variance from the Board
of Zoning Adjustment prior to commencing any work.
      (2)   Moving. A nonconforming structure, including nonconforming signs,
may not be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any
other location on the same lot or to any other lot unless the entire structure
conforms to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after
being moved.
      (3)   Reconstruction of nonconforming structure. A nonconforming
structure may be demolished and reconstructed in the exact footprint of the
original nonconforming structure. The structure may be expanded from the exact
footprint of the original nonconforming structure if the expansion conforms
with all applicable zoning regulation for the district in which the property is
located. The structure must be issued a building permit for the reconstruction
within two (2) years of when the demolition permit was granted.
   (C)   Abandonment of nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use that is
abandoned or discontinued for a period of six (6) consecutive months may not be
reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the structure or
land must conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located.
   (D)   Substitution of nonconforming use. So long as no structural
alterations are made, except as required by enforcement of other codes or
ordinances, any nonconforming use may, upon approval by the Board of Zoning
Adjustment, be changed to another nonconforming use of the same classification
or of a less intensive classification, provided that the Board shall find that
the use proposed for substitution is equally appropriate or more appropriate to
the district that the existing nonconforming use is in. In permitting such
change, the Board may require that additional conditions and safeguards be met.
Such requirements shall be stipulated conditions to the approval of such
change, and failure to meet such conditions shall be considered a violation of
this code. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a less intensive
use or becomes a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a
more intensive use or other nonconforming use.
   (E)   Expansion or substitution of nonconforming uses.
      (1)   A nonconforming use may be expanded provided that any expansion of
the nonconforming use is in conformance with all applicable zoning regulations
for the district in which the property is located.
      (2)   If the proposed expansion does not conform with applicable
regulations, the owner shall first obtain approval of a variance from the Board
of Zoning Adjustment prior to commencing any work.
      (3)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment may approve, approve with
conditions, or disapprove an application for expansion or substitution of a
nonconforming use. Such decision shall be based on written findings of fact in
consideration of the following standards (divisions (E)(3)(a) through (E)(3)
(e)). The failure of the proposed work to conform to any single factor or
standard may not necessarily be a sufficient basis for denial.
         (a)   The proposed use is consistent with the general purposes and
intent of the code.
         (b)   The proposed use promotes the safe and efficient use of land.
         (c)   The proposed use is compatible with other adjacent land uses and
buildings existing in the surrounding area.
         (d)   The proposed use is consistent with the purposes of the zoning
district in which the use is located and does not negatively impact the value
of surrounding property.
         (e)   The proposed use would be located in a building that is
specially equipped or structurally designed for that use.
   (F)   Revocation of expansion or substitution of nonconforming use.
Violation of any condition or limitation on the grant of an approval of an
expansion or substitution of a nonconforming use is a violation of this code
and constitutes grounds for revocation of the approval.
   (G)   Reconstruction of nonconforming use and structure. Any nonconforming
building or structure which has been damaged by fire, flood, explosion,
earthquake, war, riot, or act of God, may be reconstructed and used as before
if it is done within two (2) years after such damage. If any nonconforming
building or structure is destroyed by any means, other than those previously
listed, to the extent that the estimated cost of repair is greater than fifty
(50) percent of the last assessed improvement value of such structure, it shall
not be rebuilt, restored, or reoccupied for any use unless it is brought into
conformity with all regulations of this code unless permitted by the Board of
Zoning Adjustment or exempted by §
154.124 (B)(3): Reconstruction of Nonconforming Structure.

§ 154.126 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (A)   Purpose. Conditional use permits shall be required for types of uses
designed as conditionally permitted in a particular zoning district. Such use
may be permitted and desirable in certain districts, but not without
consideration. In each ease, the effect of the use upon neighboring land will
be reviewed. Enumerated throughout this code are certain uses and the districts
in which they may be permitted as conditional uses provided the following
standards are fulfilled and a conditional use is granted by the Board of Zoning
Adjustment.
   (B)   Notification requirements. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall hold a
public hearing subject to the requirements of §
154.122 (C) Public Notification for Public Hearings.
   (C)   Review factors. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider the
following standards when determining whether the issuance of a conditional use
permit is warranted:
      (1)   The conditional use is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the city's various plans and studies and will not negatively affect
or harm the appropriate use of neighboring property.
      (2)   The proposed conditional use is to be in a district wherein such
use may be permitted, subject to the requirements of this section.
      (3)   The use complies with all applicable use-specific provisions
established in §
154.148 : Permitted Uses.
      (4)   The proposed use shall be adequately served by essential public
facilities and services such as, but not limited to, roads, public safety
forces, stormwater facilities, water, sanitary sewer, refuse pick-up, and
schools, or that the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of
the proposed use shall be able to provide adequately for any such services.
      (5)   The proposed use will comply with all applicable development
standards, except as specifically altered by the Board of Zoning Adjustment in
the approved conditional use.
      (6)   The proposed use will be harmonious with the existing or intended
character of the area, will not be hazardous or have a negative impact on
adjacent properties, and will not be detrimental to property values or the
economic welfare of the general vicinity.
      (7)   The proposed use will not be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare, odor, or other characteristic that is not compatible to
the uses permitted in the applicable zoning district.
      (8)   The proposed use will not impede the normal and orderly development
and improvement of the surrounding properties for uses permitted in the
district.
   (D)   Approval conditions.
      (1)   The Board may approve, modify, or deny any application for a
conditional use permit. If the Board approves the permit, it may attach
necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more
things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a
continuing nature. The Board shall also stipulate if the conditional use permit
shall apply to the specific applicant only or if the permit shall run with the
land regardless of ownership. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the
Board's minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference to
applicable code sections.
      (2)   The Board shall have power to revoke conditional use permits for
noncompliance with the condition thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have
right of action to compel offending structures or uses removed at the cost of
the violator and as further described in §
154.992 : Violations.
      (3)   The granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the
applicant from complying with all the requirements of building, housing, and
other regulations.
      (4)   The City Planner shall review all conditional use permits, except
those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once
annually. The City Planner shall have the power to inspect the land or
structure where the conditional use is located, to ascertain that the landowner
is complying with all the conditions which are listed in the conditional use
permit. If the landowner is not complying with all the conditions listed in the
permit, the City Planner shall report the fact in writing to the Chairperson of
the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The report shall state specifically the way the
landowner is not complying with the conditions of the conditional use permit,
and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time.
The Board shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time and
notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner
at least one (1) week prior to the hearing. If the Board of Zoning Adjustment
finds that the facts alleged in the report of the City Planner are true, and
the landowner has taken no steps to comply with them between the date of the
report and the date of the hearing, the Board of Zoning Adjustment may
authorize the City Planner to revoke the conditional use permit, and take the
necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity.
      (5)   Once the Board of Zoning Adjustment has granted a conditional use
permit, and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be
completely and permanently satisfied, the City Planner, upon request of the
applicant, may, if the facts warrant, decide that the conditions have been
satisfied. The City Planner should keep this determination with a copy of the
approved conditional use permit.
   (E)   Period of validity. The approval of a conditional use permit shall
become null and void if building permits have not been issued for all buildings
and structures or if the conditionally approved use hasn't begun within one (1)
year after approval of a conditional use permit. The Board of Zoning Adjustment
may extend this time if requested and justified by the owner or agent prior to
expiration. If a conditional use expires, the owner or agent will be required
to submit a new conditional use permit application and fee and obtain new
approvals for such use.
(Ord. 22:2019, passed 6-10-19)
§ 154.127 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall have the power to authorize
variances in specific cases as described herein and that are consistent with
the provisions of this chapter and other city codes.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall hear and decide all
applications for variances from the requirements and standards set forth in
this chapter and that are not contrary to the public interest. When an owner's
authorized agent seeks a variance, said owner or agent shall be required to
establish that the literal enforcement of the code would result in an
unnecessary hardship unless a variance is granted.
      (3)   Variances shall not be granted for the use of any land, structure,
or building that is not permitted in the applicable zoning district. In those
cases, an application to rezone the property is required.
      (4)   Variances shall not be granted to alter residential density
requirements in the zone in question.
      (5)   A variance applies to the property for which it is granted, and not
to the individual who applied for it. A variance runs with the land and is
transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be transferred by
the applicant to a different site.
   (B)   Notification requirements. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall hold a
public hearing subject to the requirements of §
154.122 (C) Public Notification for Public Hearings.
   (C)   Approval conditions. The Board of Zoning Adjustment may grant
variances, as authorized in this zoning code, if it determines a justifiable
reason for the variance. The evaluation shall include, but is not limited to,
the following factors:
      (1)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district; examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness, or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures, or conditions.
      (2)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance.
      (3)   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to
make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures.
      (4)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjacent properties would suffer substantial
detriment because of the variance.
      (5)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, and refuse pick-up.
      (6)   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist because of
actions of the owner.
      (7)   Whether the property owner's predicament can feasibly be remedied
through some method other than a variance.
      (8)   Whether the spirit and intent behind these code requirements would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance.
      (9)   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
owner any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
      (10)   No single factor listed above may control, and not all factors may
be applicable in each case. Each case shall be determined on its own facts.
      (11)   Following a public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the request. If the variance is
denied by the Board of Zoning Appeals, the owner or agent may appear the
decision to City Council.
(Ord. 22:2019, passed 6-10-19)
§ 154.128 ADMINISTRATIVE WAIVERS.
   (A)   An owner or authorized agent may request an administrative waiver by
the City Planner from standards of this code. Waivers may be granted for
landscaping, parking, or dimensional, regulations not to exceed ten (10)
percent of this applicable regulation.
   (B)   Decisions on an administrative waiver shall be based on consideration
of the following criteria:
      (1)   The waiver will not impair the essential character of the
surrounding area or any objective contained within the comprehensive plan.
      (2)   The surrounding properties will be properly protected.
      (3)   The waiver request is minor in nature and does not substantially
deviate from prior issuances of the Board of Zoning Adjustment (if applicable).
      (4)   The waiver request does not deviate from the overall intent and
objective of the original regulation, the approved development plan, or
applicable plats.
      (5)   The waiver request is for a single item. If multiple waivers are
requested, the owner or representative shall be required to obtain approval of
a variance from the Board of Zoning Adjustment for such a request.
   (C)   An administrative waiver, including conditions, shall run with the
land and shall not be affected by change of ownership.
   (D)   Administrative waivers may not be granted to reduce the required
minimum lot size or increase permitted residential density.
(Ord. 22:2019, passed 6-10-19)
§ 154.129 DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USE.
   (A)   Where there is a proposed use that is not currently listed in §
154.148 : Permitted Uses, the City Planner may review the use to determine the
appropriate zoning district(s), if any, where the use may be permitted. The
nature, operation, and function of the use shall be analyzed in the
determination of the appropriate district(s).
   (B)   The City Planner may forward his/her decision to Planning Commission
for review and to determine if the proposed use should be enumerated in this
zoning code as a permitted use in the appropriate zoning district(s) pursuant
to §
154.123 : Zoning Text and Map Amendments.
   (C)   The City Planner may find that the proposed use is not compatible with
any existing zoning districts and not permit the use under the current zoning
code. The owner or owner's authorized agent may appeal the decision of the City
Planner to Planning Commission for review and final decision.   
(Ord. 22:2019, passed 6-10-19)
§ 154.130 TEMPORARY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment has the right to grant the temporary
use of a building or premises in any district for a purpose or use that does
not conform to the regulations prescribed by this chapter for the district in
which it is located. Provided that the use is of a true temporary nature and
does not involve the erection of a permanent building or structure. The permit
shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit for a maximum
twelve (12) month period and may be subject to conditions as placed on the
temporary use by the Board of Zoning Adjustment to safeguard the public health,
safety, convenience, and general welfare.
   (B)   Temporary structures shall require a permit with the exception of the
following:
      (1)   Tents, campers, cabanas, or structures similar in nature which are

alter, repair, move, demolish, or change the occupancy of a building or
structure shall first make application with the City Planner and obtain the
required permit.
   (B)   When a conditional use or dimensional variance is required, no
building permit shall be issued without applicable approvals.
   (C)   All applications where building permits are required shall be
accompanied by plans in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual shape and
dimensions of the lot to be built upon; the exact size and location on the lot
of any existing principal uses and buildings; the lines within which the
proposed buildings or structures are to be erected or altered; the proposed
height; the existing and intended use of each building; and other information
with regard to the lot and neighboring lots as may be necessary to determine
and provide for the enforcement of this zoning code. One copy of the plans
shall be returned to the applicant by the City Planner, after he or she has
marked the copy either as approved or disapproved and attested to the same by
his or her signature on the copy. The original, simply marked, shall be
retained by the City Planner.
(Ord. 22:2019, passed 6-10-19)
§ 154.132 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   Certificate of occupancy required. No person shall use or permit the
use of any structure or premises or part thereof hereafter created, erected,
changed, converted, enlarged or moved, wholly or partly, until a certificate of
occupancy shall have been issued by the City Planner. The certificate shall
show the structure or use, or both, or the premises or the affected part
thereof are in conformity with the provisions of the latest building permit. It
shall be the duty of the City Planner to issue the certificate if he or she
finds that all of the provisions of this zoning code have been met and to
withhold the certificate unless all requirements of this permit have been met.
   (B)   Temporary certificates of occupancy. A temporary certificate of
occupancy may be issued by the City Planner for a period not exceeding six (6)
months, during alterations or partial occupancy of a building pending its
completion. He or she may require special conditions or safeguards as he or she
deems necessary in order to protect the safety of the public.

application from the owner or tenant, and upon inspection to determine the
facts in the case, the City Planner shall issue a certificate of occupancy for
any building, premises, or use, certifying that the building, premises, or use
are in conformity with the provisions of this zoning code, or that a legal
nonconformity exists as specified herein.
   (D)   Structures and uses to be provided in building permits, plans, and
certificates of occupancy. Building permits or certificates of occupancy issued
on the basis of plans and applicants approved by the City Planner authorize
only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in the permits, plans,
and certificates and no other. Any use, arrangement, or construction at
variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this zoning code.

§ 154.143 ZONING DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENTS.
   The following are the statements of purpose for each of the city's zoning
districts established in this zoning code.
   (A)   Agricultural "AG" District. The purpose of this district is to serve
as a holding classification for land which may eventually be required for more
intensive uses. The regulations for the agricultural zone discourage the
premature urban development of the rural areas, and discourage or prohibit all
commercial or industrial development, except for certain agriculturally related
commercial, industrial, and recreational activities that are appropriate for
the zone.
   (B)   Rural Settlement "RS" District. This zone consists of an area one mile
in diameter and is centered over several small, unincorporated rural
settlements in and around the city. The purpose of this zone is to preserve the
rural service nature of the settlements, but also permits the expansion of
residential and rural service business developments. Until adequate facilities
are provided, urban development at urban densities is discouraged.
   (C)   Low Density Residential "R-1" District. The purpose of this zone is to
provide space for low density single-family dwellings which can be provided
with approved sewer and water services.
   (D)   Medium Density Residential "R-2" District. The purpose of this zone is
to provide, in addition to single-family dwellings, space for two-family
dwellings and multifamily residential dwellings up to five (5) units, and the
customary accessory uses and structures in areas which can be provided with
approved sewer and water services.
   (E)   High Density Residential "R-3" District. The purpose of this zone is
to provide space for multifamily residential units, in addition to single-
family and two-family dwellings, in areas which can be provided with approved
sewer and water services.
   (F)   General Business "B-1" District. The purpose of this zone is to
provide space for a variety of retail sales and service uses in the city.
   (G)   Highway Business "B-2" District. The purpose of this zone is to
encourage the establishment of areas for highway business uses. This zone is
specifically designed to service the motoring public.
   (H)   Central Business "B-3" District. The purpose of this zone is to
provide space for those retail sales, service, and public uses that generally
serve the entire community, and can best perform that service from a
centralized location.
   (I)   Light Industrial "I-1" District. The purpose of this zone is primarily
for manufacturing and assembly plants, warehousing, wholesale establishments,
and other similar uses which are conducted with a minimum of noise, glare,
vibrations, odor, dust, and other objectionable characteristics.
   (J)   Public and Semipublic "P-1" District. The purpose of this zone is to
identify land which is owned and used by a public entity, including schools,
cemeteries, parks, playgrounds, and forest service land.
(Ord. 22:2019, passed 6-10-19)

action of the city, the zone boundary shall be automatically extended to the
center of the vacated public right-of-way, and all areas included in the
vacated area in question shall be subject to all appropriate regulations of the
extended area.

         (a)   Manufactured homes shall be installed in accordance with the
State of Kentucky standards set forth in KRS 227.570 and placed on a permanent
foundation system.
         (b)   Each section of a manufactured home shall be inspected for the
correct federal or state seal. In the case of manufactured homes, the HUD seal

accordance with §
154.174 : Off-Street Parking Regulations.
      (2)   Additional standards for qualified manufactured homes.
         (a)   The additional standards for qualified manufactured homes apply
only to manufactured homes that are located in the following:

            4.   That are not located in a manufactured home or mobile home
zoning district or an agricultural zoning district.
         (b)   The following compatibility standards for qualified manufactured
homes relate to architectural features that have a significant impact on the
overall assessed value of the structure. This ensures that when a qualified
manufactured home is placed in a residential zoning district it is compatible,
in terms of assessed value, with existing housing located with a one-eighth (1/
8) mile or less radius from the proposed location of the qualified manufactured
home.
            1.   The manufactured home shall be new and unused.
            2.   Is affixed to a permanent foundation and is connected to the
appropriate facilities and is installed in compliance with KRS 227.570.
            3.   The tongue, axle, and wheels shall be removed from the
manufactured home.
            4.   Has a width of at least twenty (20) feet at its smallest width
measurement or is two (2) stories in height and oriented on the lot or parcel

conform to the site development regulations prescribed in HB417 (an act
relating to manufactured home, mobile home, and recreational vehicle
communities).
      (4)   Manufactured home communities.
         (a)   Manufactured home communities are conditionally permitted in the
Agricultural "AG", Rural Settlement "RS", Medium Density Residential "R-2"
Zoning District, and the High Density Residential "R-3" Zoning District and are
subject to regulations set forth in §
154.126 : Conditional Use Permit.
         (b)   Manufactured home communities shall be subject to the

      (2)   Yards required for buildings. A yard or other open space required
for a building shall not be included as part of a yard or other open space for
another building.
      (3)   Front yard modifications . In areas where there is an established
development pattern, the required minimum front yard setback shall be the
average of the existing front yard setback of all principal structures on the
same side of the street and within three hundred (300) feet of the subject lot.
If the average is less than the district requirement, the required minimum
front setback is the average as calculated. This does not apply to panhandle
lots (otherwise known as flag lots) which must meet the frontage dimension
requirements of the zoning district in which they are located or shall require
a variance approval. Modification of the front yard in accordance with this
section will not create a nonconforming lot unless the lot or structure does
not meet other applicable provisions of this code.

hundred (200) feet frontage upon a public street, nor shall any driveway be
located closer than fifty (50) feet to the intersection of two (2) public
streets.
      (2)   All access drives shall have travel lanes of a minimum width of ten
(10) feet and a maximum width of twelve (12) feet per lane.
      (3)   Except for driveways serving single household dwellings and two (2)
household dwellings, wherever more than three (3) parking spaces are served by
a single driveway, a turnaround area shall be provided, or other provision
shall be made to permit vehicles to exit the parking lot or garage without
backing onto any street or sidewalk.
      (4)   Cross-access is encouraged between adjacent commercial properties.
   (E)   Striping and identification. Parking spaces shall be clearly outlined
with painted lines on the parking surface. The striping shall be continuously

as approved by the City Planner unless required by state law (i.e., parking for
the disabled).
   (F)   Pavement.
      (1)   Parking areas and access driveways shall be improved with asphalt
or concrete, unless otherwise authorized as provided in divisions (F)(2) and
(F)(3) below.
      (2)   Pavers, pervious pavement, chip-and-seal, or gravel may be used for
off-street parking areas if approved by Planning Commission. Residential
driveways may be constructed of pavers, pervious pavement, chip-and-seal, or
gravel if approved by the City Planner.
      (3)   Gravel specifications.
         (a)   Gravel used for off-street parking or drives must be #57 size or
smaller.
         (b)   Where gravel is used, an asphalt or concrete transition is

         (c)   Curbing is required for gravel use as specified in §
154.173 (G): Curbing.
         (d)   Property owners are required to maintain gravel areas and must
remove any gravel spread from adjacent non-gravel driveways or roads.
   (G)   Curbing. When appropriate, off-street parking facilities shall be
improved with a poured concrete curb, precast concrete barrier, or other
barrier to define the limits of paved areas except at the points of entrance
and exit, unless authorized by the City Planner. Wherever a parking lot extends
to a property line, fencing, wheel stops, concrete curbs, or other suitable
barriers should be provided to prevent any part of a parked vehicle from
extending beyond the property line and from destroying screening material.
   (H)   Drainage. Off-street parking areas for more than five (5) vehicles
shall be graded and drained so that the natural flow of surface water shall not
be changed or concentrated onto adjacent property by means other than a
designated drainage course. Stormwater management shall comply with all
applicable city policies and procedures.
   (I)   Visibility. Access of driveways for off-street parking areas shall be
located in such a way that any vehicle entering or leaving such parking area
shall be clearly visible by any pedestrian or motorist approaching the access
or driveway from a public street, private street, or alley. No object,
including parking lot lighting, signage, or landscaping shall be in an area
that obstructs vision in the sight triangle as illustrated below. Structures
and vegetation within the visibility triangle are permitted at a maximum height
of three (3) feet. Trees within the visibility triangle are permitted that have
branches no lower than eight (8) feet in height.

unloading.
(Ord. 22:2019, passed 6-10-19)
§ 154.174 OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Units of measure. The following rules shall apply when computing
parking spaces:
      (1)   Driveway space. Entrances, exits, or driveways shall not be
computed as part of a required parking lot or area, except in the case of
single-family and two-family dwellings where driveways may be used in
calculating the amount of off-street parking.
      (2)   Multiple uses. Unless otherwise noted or approved, off-street
parking areas serving more than one (1) use shall provide parking in an amount
equal to the combined total of the requirements of each use.
      (3)   Area measurements.
         (a)   Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square footage-based
parking standards shall be computed based on gross floor area of all floors of
a non-residential or mixed-use building.
         (b)   The areas of a non-residential or mixed-use building that are
used for storage, restrooms, loading/unloading, mechanical equipment,
stairwells, and elevator shafts may be excluded from the gross floor area
calculation.
         (c)   When a measurement of the number of required spaces results in a
fractional number, the fraction shall be rounded up to the next highest whole
number.
         (d)   Parking space requirements for a use not specifically mentioned
in this code shall be determined by using the most similar and restrictive

§ 155.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS Chapter 100
delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed
to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the Board of City Council of Morehead, Kentucky, hereby adopts the
following floodplain management chapter.
(Ord. 05:2011, passed 3-28-11)
§ 155.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Morehead are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 05:2011, passed 3-28-11)
§ 155.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers that accommodate or channel flood waters;
D) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase
erosion or flood damage; and
   (D)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 05:2011, passed 3-28-11)
§ 155.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
Special Flood Hazard Area.
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area assume
responsibility for their actions.

same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principle structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   “ACCESSORY USE.” A use that is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   “ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).” Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common

interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator's ruling on a request for a variance.
   “AR/A1 - A30, ARME. AR/AH. AR/AO, AND ARM ZONES.” Special Flood Hazard Areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   “A99 ZONE.” That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system
under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.” A designated AO or AH Zone on a community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one (1)
to three (3) feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “B AND X ZONES (SHADED).” Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot

floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
subsection (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,

cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.

§ 155.06 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), areas applicable to KRS 151.250 and, as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator or other delegated, designated, or
qualified community official as determined by the Board of City Council of
Morehead from available technical studies, historical information, and other
available and reliable sources, areas within the jurisdiction of the Board of
City Council of Morehead which may be subject to periodic inundation by
floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens of Morehead.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Rowan County, dated April 18,
2011, with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS), other supporting
data and any subsequent amendments thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a pan of these regulations by Morehead, and for those land areas
acquired by Morehead through annexation. This FIS and attendant mapping is the
minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by
studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which
are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator and are
enacted by City Council pursuant to statutes governing land use management
regulations. The FIS and/or FIRM are permanent records of Morehead and are on
file and available for review by the public during regular business hours at
City Hall.
   (C)   Establishment of development permit. A Development Permit shall be
required in conformance with the provision of this chapter prior to the
commencement of any development activities in the special flood hazard areas
(SFHA). See §
155.07(B) for instructions and explanation. Application for a development
permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other applicable state regulations.
Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking such
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (G)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part
of the Board of City Council of Morehead, any officer or employee, the
Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Federal Insurance Administration, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, thereof for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
   (H)   Enforcement, violation notice and penalties.
      (1)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this ordinance including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and
any approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
      (2)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
      (3)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this ordinance or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven (7) days of the date the
citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven (7) days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
      (4)   Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure
to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special
exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined no less than one hundred dollars ($100.00)
and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each
day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking such
other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

§ 155.07 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Designation of local administrator. The Board of City Council of
Morehead hereby appoints the Building Inspector to administer, implement, and
enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting or denying development
permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein referred to as the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be
obtained before any construction or other development begins within any special
flood hazard area established in §
155.06(B). Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms
furnished by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and
may include, but not be limited to, the following; plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
      (1)   Application stage.
         (a)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
         (b)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level to which any
non-residential structure will be flood-proofed;
         (c)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §
155.08(B)(2) and (D)(2);
         (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      (2)   Construction stage.
         (a)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to Mean Sea Level, In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the Community has adopted a regulatory Base Flood Elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
         (b)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
   (C)   Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed,
authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of

§ 155.08 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   General construction standards. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas the
following provisions are required:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy;
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or fame ties to ground anchors. This standard
shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for
resisting wind forces;
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
      (4)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (5)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding; and if
      (6)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (7)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
      (8)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;
      (9)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and
      (10)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter;
      (11)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not furthered, extended, or
replaced.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation data have been provided, as set forth in §
155.06(B), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor; including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated
no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with standards of §
155.08(B)(3).
         (a)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth
number is specified.
         (b)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states
as a part of the technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The
applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and
thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA
maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
(0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific site elevations that extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
         (c)   In all other Zones, elevated one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   Non-residential Construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with §
155.08(B)(1) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
         (a)   Be floodproofed below an elevation one (1) foot above the level
of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         (b)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
         (c)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
elevation; or
         (d)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall
be provided to the official as set forth in §
155.07(B)(1)(c).
         (e)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in §
155.08(B)(4).
         (f)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical
Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
            1.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect; or
            2.   Have a minimum of two (2) openings with a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwater.
      (3)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements
of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
         (a)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
            1.   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area
of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or
higher than the exterior foundation grade); and
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
         (b)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
         (c)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
      (4)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
         (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood

            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result
of a flood;
            All manufactured homes must be:
               (i)   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and
               (ii)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1) foot
above the level of the base flood elevation; and
               (iii)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
         (b)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage
as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
            1.   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,

consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured
homes”.
   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and
insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations, is
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
      (5)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established
in § 155.06(B), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
         (a)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
         (b)   If §
155.08(B)(5) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
and other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of §
155.08.
   (C)   Standards for streams without established base flood elevation
(unnumbered a zones) and/or floodways. Located within the special flood hazard
areas established in §
155.06(B), where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided
or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
      (2)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
155.06(B).
   (D)   Standards for shallow flooding zones. Located within the special flood
hazard areas established in §
155.06(B), are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet,
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall: Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall:
         (a)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
         (b)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as stated in §
155.08(B)(2).
   (E)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood
hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage;
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
      (4)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available (Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data
for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five
(5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.
      (5)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed
structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base
flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (F)   Standards for accessory structures in all zones beginning with the
letter'A'. For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas
designated 'A' the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Structure must be non-habitable;
      (2)   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;
      (3)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one (1) foot above
grade, total openings are to be one square inch per one (1) square foot of
floor area, at least two (2) openings required on opposite walls;
      (4)   Built of flood resistant materials below a level one (1) foot above
the base flood elevation;
      (5)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;
      (6)   Can only be used for storage or parking;
      (7)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.
   (G)   Critical facilities. Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year
floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible
within the floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no
feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within
the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one (1) foot or more above the
level of the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing
measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by
or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of
the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the
extent possible.
(Ord. 05:2011, passed 3-28-11)
§ 155.09 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The Board of City Council of
Morehead shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of the Board of City
Council.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local District Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations that are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under "public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
   (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §
155.08 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25) for one hundred dollars ($100)
of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Morehead Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
and
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

§ 157.15 ABANDONED URBAN PROPERTY AS REAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   This section shall be designated as "Abandoned Urban Property
Classified Real Property".
   (B)   Abandoned urban property is established as a separate classification
of real property for the purpose of ad valorem taxation. As used in the
subchapter, "ABANDONED URBAN PROPERTY" shall be defined as:
      (1)   Any vacant structure or vacant unimproved lot or parcel of ground
in the city which has been vacant or unimproved for a period of at least one
(1) year and which:
         (a)   Because it is dilapidated, unsanitary, unsafe, varmint infested
or otherwise dangerous to the safety of persons, it is unfit for its intended
use; or
         (b)   By reason of neglect or lack of maintenance has become a place
for the accumulation of trash and debris; or has become infested with rodents
or other varmints; or
         (c)   Has been tax delinquent for a period of at least three (3)
years.
      (2)   Any property in the city that has been identified as "blighted" or
"deteriorated" by the Property Maintenance Appeals and Review Commission.
   (C)   The rate of taxation levied upon abandoned urban properties is fifty
cents ($0.50) on each one hundred dollars ($100.00) of assessed value.
   (D)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall, each year, determine which
properties in the city are "abandoned urban properties" and shall prepare and
furnish a list of abandoned urban properties located in the city to the County
Property Valuation Administrator prior to January 1 of each year.
   (E)   Except as otherwise provided in division (F) of this section, a
property classified by the Code Enforcement Officer as abandoned property as of
January 1 shall be taxed as abandoned urban property for such year. If the
owner repairs, rehabilitates, or otherwise returns the property to productive
use so that the property is no longer abandoned urban property, he/she shall
notify the Code Enforcement Officer of the city. If the Code Enforcement
Officer finds the property no longer abandoned urban property, he/she shall
notify the Rowan County Property Valuation Administrator to strike the property
from the list of abandoned urban properties as of the succeeding January 1.
   (F)   No later than March 1 of each year, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
mail by first class mail to owners of each abandoned urban property, as are
listed in the records of the Rowan County Property Valuation Administrator a
notice that their properties have been classified as abandoned urban property.
Each owner may appeal such classification to the Property Maintenance Appeals
and Review Commission. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be made no
later than April 1 of the year the notice is received. The Commission shall
afford the owner the opportunity for a hearing. If the Commission finds that
the property was incorrectly classified as abandoned urban property, it shall
cause the property to be removed from the list of property so classified. The
Commission shall develop policies and procedures for conducting such appeals.

§ 158.01 INTENT.
   (A)   Purpose. In order to promote the economic and general welfare of the
people of the city and to ensure the complementary, orderly, and efficient
growth of the community, the city deems it essential that the qualities
relating to the history of the community and a harmonious outward appearance of
structures be preserved. The federal government and Commonwealth of Kentucky
have passed laws to protect historic districts and landmarks. Historic
preservation and appropriate design will attract both tourists and residents
and improve property values. It is the finding of the city that the unique
character and appearance of this community cannot be enhanced unless its
distinctive historic structures, districts and sites are preserved and unless
the design and appearance of structures within the downtown area are preserved
and/or enhanced.
   (B)   Policies. In furtherance of these objectives, this chapter provides
for the mandatory review by a Board of Architectural Review of any and all
public and private projects involving permanent construction, demolition,
alteration, repairs, maintenance or rehabilitation to properties in a
designated historic district that would change the exterior appearance of
buildings or property sites visible from public rights-of-way. The Board of
Architectural Review shall endeavor to support and reinforce all laws that
protect and preserve historic properties and implement the design guidelines
adopted herein, while striving to provide assistance and information to
property owners in the downtown area concerning historic design concepts, tax
incentives and other development strategies. Through these regulations, the
city seeks to foster civic pride in the value of accomplishments of the past,
while enhancing the aesthetic character that serves as a reminder of the
history and heritage of this community.
(Ord. 05:2002, passed 4-8-02)
