the Human Rights Commission. Such statement shall be in writing, signed by the
person aggrieved and shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The name and address of the complainant.
      (2)   The name and address (if known) of the alleged violator or provide
facts sufficient to identify such person.
      (3)   An outline of the material facts upon which the complaint is based.
      (4)   The alleged violation.
      (5)   That any conduct of the complainant was for the purpose of
obtaining the housing, employment, or public accommodation in question and not
of the purpose of harassment or entrapment of the person against whom the
complaint is made.
      (6)   That a complaint concerning this same matter has not been filed
with another agency or that any complaint concerning this matter filed with
another agency has been dismissed by such agency without final judgment on the
merits.
      (7)   The written complaint statement must be filed with the City Clerk
within 180 days after the alleged violation.
   (B)   (1)   If the Commission (after review of the complaint) determines
that the facts and/or allegations DO NOT support allegations of discrimination
based upon race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age (40 or over),
familial status, sexual orientation or gender identity, the Commission shall
notify the complainant, within ten days of its determination. The complainant
shall have the right to re-submit its complaint to the Commission, within ten
days of notification by the Commission, for further review. Any re-submission
by the complainant shall be reviewed by the Commission, within ten days of
receipt. Any complainant shall have only the right to re-submit their complaint
one time after the initial complaint for the same infraction or occurrence.
      (2)   If the Commission determines that the complaint (initial or
resubmitted) "supports" the allegations of discrimination as identified within
this chapter, then the Commission shall cause to be served, a complete copy of
the complaint and all attachments, upon the respondent(s) identified in the
complaint, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any appropriate
legal process available to the Commission. Upon receipt of service, the
respondent(s) shall have 20 days to file a written response with the
Commission. Failure to file a written response may result in any authority
reviewing the complaint making a determination that the allegations contained
therein are true. Upon the lapse of the 20-day time period following successful
service on the respondent(s), the Commission shall forward the complaint and
response (if any), along with all attachments, exhibits, statements, etc. to
the Mayor's office for the purpose of mitigation between or among the parties.
The Mayor or his designee shall establish a set time and dare for all parties
to meet in an attempt to negotiate an amicable settlement among the parties. If
an amicable settlement is reached, then all parties shall acknowledge that an
agreement exists and that the case shall be final. If an amicable settlement
cannot be reached, the Mayor shall appoint a member of his staff, along with
two members of the Commission to conduct a full investigation of the
allegations contained in the complaint. This committee shall be called the
"Investigative Committee of the Human Rights Commission", the (ICHRC). The
ICHRC shall conduct an investigation based on their understanding of the
allegations in the complaint. The ICHRC may schedule a hearing and may
interview witnesses. The results of the ICHRC investigation shall be submitted,
in writing, to the Mayor's office for further determination of the probable
cause by the Mayor. If the Mayor determines (after the investigation) that no
probable cause exists, then written notice shall be served on all parties, with
ten days. Any party shall have ten days following receipt of the Notice to file
with the Mayor's office, a written notice of reconsideration. Upon receipt of
the notice of reconsideration, the Mayor shall appoint an independent three
member review panel (panel) to review the request. NO member of this panel
shall have been a participant in any previous review of the complaint to be
reconsidered. If this panel determines that no probable cause exists, then
there shall be no further action required by the Commission or by the City of
Murray.
      (3)   If after the panel review there is determined that probable cause
exists to "support" the allegations in the complaint, then the Mayor shall
endeavor to eliminate the alleged violation by a conciliation agreement signed
by all parties and the Mayor wherein the alleged violation is eliminated and
the complainant is made whole to the extent possible. If a conciliation
agreement is not achieved, the complainant will be informed of his right to:
(1) independently file his/her complaint with the Kentucky Commission on Human
Rights; and/or (2) independently file his/her complaint with a court of
competent jurisdiction.
      (4)   At all times herein the complainant shall have the absolute right
to: (1) independently file his/her complaint with the Kentucky Commission on
Human Rights; and/or (2) independently file his/her complaint with a court of
competent jurisdiction.

historic preservation program within the Historic District will benefit all the

heritage of the city, state and nation. The Council declares as a matter of
public policy that this subchapter is required in the interest of the health,
prosperity, safety, welfare and economic well-being of the people.
   (H)   The Council finds that the Main Street program has contributed to the

preservation program will strengthen the current revitalization work in the
city.

the above findings and declarations of public policy and specifically, but not

§ 32.69 APPROVAL OF CHANGES TO LANDMARKS AND PROPERTY IN HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Requirement for Certificate of Appropriateness. A Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be required before a person may undertake the following
actions affecting a landmark or a property in an historic district:
      (1)   Alteration of the exterior part of a building or structure that is
visible to the public;
      (2)   New construction;
      (3)   Demolition; or
      (4)   Relocation.
   A Certificate of Appropriateness is required even when the proposed work
does not require a building permit.
   (B)   Application process.
      (1)   An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness may be obtained
from the City of Murray Planning Department. City staff will meet with the
applicant regarding the application process and guidelines to ensure completion
of application. In addition to the application, the applicant shall provide
drawings of the proposed work, photographs of the existing building or site and
adjacent properties, and information about the building materials to be used.
All applications will be reviewed by the Board at a public hearing, except for
those applications proposing exterior alterations to a structure or property
that meet the criteria as designated in the city design guidelines. The Board
shall grant the city staff authority to review and issue a certificate of
appropriateness for such applications.
      (2)   Stop work order. In the event work is being performed without the
required Certificate of Appropriateness, the Board or City Official shall
direct the Building Inspector to issue a Stop Work Order. All work shall cease
on the designated property until a certificate of appropriateness has been
issued.
   (C)   Action by the Architectural Review Board: notice. Once a completed
Certificate of Appropriateness application has been received the Board shall
hold a public hearing to consider the request. Notice of the public hearing
shall be given at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the public hearing by
first class mail to all surrounding property owners along with a notice of the
hearing by publication in the Murray Ledger and Times in Murray. Kentucky not
less than seven (7) days nor more than twenty-one (21) days prior to the public
hearing. At the public hearing, the Board shall consider the request for a
Certificate of Appropriateness by examining the staff report, and hearing
testimony of the applicant, and interested citizens speaking in favor or in
opposition of the proposed changes. The Board shall consider: (1) the effect of
the proposed work on the landmark or the property in the historic district upon
which such work is to be done, and (2) the relationship between such work and
other adjacent or nearby buildings and property. In evaluating the effect and
the relationship, the Board shall consider historical and architectural
significance, architectural style, design, texture of materials and color and
may suggest modifications to the application. The Certificate of
Appropriateness issued by the Board shall not relieve the applicant from
complying with the requirements of other state and local laws and regulations.
The Board shall vote to approve or disapprove all or a part of the application
within ninety (90) days after the completed application is filed. If the
application is approved city staff shall then issue the Certificate of
Appropriateness and the applicant may apply for a building permit (if
applicable) to begin work. If the application is disapproved, the Board shall
notify the applicant in writing the reasons for such disapproval. The applicant
may not reapply for the same request for a period of six (6) months from the
date of action taken by the Board unless otherwise noted.
    (D)   Routine Alterations: Ordinary Maintenance and Repairs.
      (1)   The Board may prepare a list of routine alterations that may
receive immediate approval without a public hearing, when an applicant complies
with the written guidelines of the Board. At each meeting the Board shall be
informed of the Certificates of Appropriateness that have been issued under
this provision. The Board shall not regulate the color of paint used on
designated property, but it may prepare and distribute material on paint colors
appropriate for different types and styles of buildings.
      (2)   Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a
Certificate of Appropriateness provided this work on a landmark or a property
in an historic district does not change its exterior appearance that is visible
to the public. Every person in charge of a landmark or a property in an
historic district shall keep it in good repair: (1) all of the exterior
portions of such buildings or structures; and (2) all interior portions thereof
which, if not so maintained, may cause such buildings or structures to
deteriorate or to become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of
disrepair. The purpose of this provision is to prevent a person from forcing
the demolition of his building by neglecting it and by permitting damage to the
building because of weather or vandalism.
      (3)   No provision in this subchapter shall be interpreted to require an
owner or tenant to undertake an alteration or to restore his building to its
original appearance. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to the
provisions of the Kentucky Building Code requiring buildings and structures to
be kept in good repair.
   (E)   Meetings with owners about condition of buildings. The Board shall
request a meeting with a property owner when his landmark or his building in an
historic district is in poor repair, and the Board shall discuss with the owner
ways to improve the condition of his property. After this step, the Board may
request the Building Inspector to take action to require correction of defects
in conflict with the city's building code and property maintenance code any
building or structure designated under this subchapter so that such building or
structure shall be preserved in accordance with the purposes of the subchapter.
Action taken by the city may include boarding up the doors, windows, and other
parts of the building and additional steps to stabilize walls, roofs and other
parts of the building or structure.
   (F)   Emergency situations. In any case where the Building Inspector
determines that there are emergency conditions dangerous to life, health or
property affecting a landmark or a property in an historic district, he may
order the remedying of these conditions without the approval of the Board. When
it is possible, he shall consult with the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the
Board about the action being taken. If consultation is not possible, the city
shall notify the Board of the action taken after the completion of the work.
   (G)   Demolition of a landmark or a building or structure in an historic
district. When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark or a building or
structure in an historic district, the Board shall negotiate with the applicant
to see if an alternative to demolition can be found. The Board may ask
interested individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an
alternative to demolition and in obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs
for the threatened building. After its public hearing, the Board may decide
that the building or structure in an historic district may be demolished
because it does not contribute to the historic district. On all other
demolition applications, the Board shall study the question of economic
hardship for the applicant and shall determine whether the landmark or the
property in the historic district can be put to reasonable beneficial use
without the approval of the demolition application. In the case of an income -
producing building, the Board shall also determine whether the applicant can
obtain a reasonable return from his building. The Board may ask applicants for
additional information to be used in making these determinations. If economic
hardship or the lack of a reasonable return is not proved, the Board shall deny
the demolition application unless the Board finds grounds to grant the
demolition application under the points contained in §
32.68(A) through (D).
   (H)   Moving a landmark or a building or structure in an historic district.
When applicant wishes to move a landmark or a building or structure in a
historic district or when an applicant wishes to move a building or structure
to a lot containing a landmark or to a property in an historic district, the
Board shall consider:
      (1)    The contribution the building or structure makes to the present
setting;
      (2)    Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated;
      (3)    Whether the building or structure can be moved without significant
damage to its physical integrity; and
      (4)    The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed
site and adjacent properties. These considerations shall be in additions to the
points contained in §
32.68(A) through (D).
   (I)   Length of validity of certificate of appropriateness. A Certificate of
Appropriateness shall remain valid for six (6) months after it is issued. Work
is required to begin before the end of the six (6) month period. Actual work is
hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition is
required preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition shall be
deemed to be actual work provided that shall be carried out diligently.
   (J)   Appeal of the Board's decision. The applicant shall have a right to
appeal a decision by the Board to the City Council on any request to amend the
original designated boundaries or an application for a Certificate of

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 36.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)   As defined in §
36.01, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
36.12, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a request or complete a written application for such records at the
office of the City Clerk during regular office hours, except during legal
holidays. The application shall be hand delivered, mailed, or sent via
facsimile to the City Clerk's office.
(KRS 61.872 (2))
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person's request is in compliance
with the open records law and the requested records are immediately available,
the custodian shall deliver the records for inspection. Suitable facilities
shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk for the inspection. No
person shall remove original copies of public records from the offices of any
public agency without the written permission of the official custodian of the
record.
(KRS 61.872(1).
   (C)   An applicant may inspect public records during the regular business
hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from the city
through the mail if the applicant's residence or principal place of business is
outside of the county in which the city is located and he has precisely
described public records which are available within the city. If the person
requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed, the official
custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of
mailing. KRS 61.872(3).
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
36.01.
(KRS 61.874(1))
   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency

than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(1))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874 (4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874 (5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).

records requested, the City Clerk shall so notify the applicant and shall
furnish the name and location of the custodian of the public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 36.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 36.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 36.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within three (3) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
three-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian's authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
(KRS 61.880)
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.
(KRS 61.880, 61.882)
§ 36.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under

and federal funds on Community Development Block Grant Projects will be made in
accordance with the following procurement standards.
(Ord. 85-8l7, passed ll-27-85; Am. Ord. 2020-1794, passed 4-23-20)
§ 37.02 MAXIMIZATION OF FREE AND OPEN COMPETITION.
   Procurement transactions, regardless of method or dollar value, will
maximize open and free competition. The city shall not engage in procurement
practices which may be considered restrictive in trade.
(Ord. 85-817, passed 11-27-85; Am. Ord. 2020-1794, passed 4-23-20)
§ 37.03 REVIEW BY TREASURER.
   Purchases will be reviewed by the Treasurer to prevent duplication and to
ensure that costs are reasonable.
(Ord. 85-817, passed 11-27-85; Am. Ord. 2020-1794, passed 4-23-20)
§ 37.04 CONTRACTS.
   Generally, all procurement in excess of $500 will be memorialized and
supported by a written contract. Where it is infeasible or impractical to
prepare a contract, a written finding to this effect will be prepared and some
form of documentation regarding the transaction will also be prepared. The
contractual provisions required by "The Common Rule" will be included in all
contracts and purchase orders.

§ 37.05 DOCUMENTATION.
   All source documents supporting any given transaction (receipts, purchase
orders, invoices, request for proposals/request for qualification data, and bid
materials) will be retained and filed in an appropriate manner. Where feasible,
source documents pertinent to each individual procurement shall be separately
filed and maintained. Where it is feasible to maintain individual procurement
files, source documents will be filed and maintained in a reasonable manner
(examples include chronologically, by vendor, by type of procurement, etc.).
Whatever form of documentation and filing is employed, the purpose of this
section is to ensure that a clear and consistent audit trail is established. At
a minimum, source document data must be sufficient to establish the basis for
selection, basis for cost (including the issue of reasonableness of cost), and
basis for payment.

   Efforts will be made and documented to solicit participation of locally
owned, minority owned, and female owned businesses. Where feasible, evaluation
criteria will include a factor with an appropriate weight for these firms. A
list of locally owned, minority and female owned businesses, and minority
businesses located within the trade region shall be maintained and utilized
when issuing invitations for bids, requests for proposals, and requests for
qualifications. This list shall also be consulted when making small purchases.

and best price, but written records of such efforts are not necessary.
   (B) Purchases that cost more than $50 but less than $30,000 require
quotations of rate, price, etc., but no legal advertisement is required. The
city will solicit written responses from at least three vendors, and if no such

prepared and filed. If quotations are obtained via telephone, a memorandum will
be prepared setting forth the date the calls were made, parties contacted, and
prices obtained.
   (C)   The city will make the award to the lowest responsive and responsible
source, and enter into a contract formalizing the scope of work and terms of
compensation.
(Ord. 85-8l7, passed ll-27-85; Am. Ord. 2020-1794, passed 4-23-20)
Penalty, see § 37.99
§ 37.17 COMPETITIVE SEALED BIDS.
   (A)   Bidding will be employed when detailed specifications for the goods or
services to be procured can be prepared and the primary basis for award is
cost. When the cost of a contract, lease, or other agreement for materials,
supplies, equipment, or contractual services other than those personal or
professional exceeds $30,000, an invitation for bids notice will generally be
prepared. Per KRS 424.120 this notice will be published at least once in a
qualifying official newspaper of general circulation within the community. This
newspaper notice will appear not less than seven days and not more than 2l days
before the due date for bid proposals. In addition, the city must also solicit
sealed bids from responsible prospective suppliers by distributing a copy of
such notice to them.
   (B)   The invitation for bids will include a general description of the
goods or services to be procured, the bid deposit and bond performance required
(if applicable), the location where bid forms and specifications may be
secured, the time and place for opening bids, and whether the bid award will be
made on the basis of the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated price. If the
lowest evaluated price is used, the measurable criteria to be utilized must be
stated in the invitation for bids. The newspaper notice must also contain
language which calls to the attention of the bidders all applicable
requirements which must be complied with such as Section 3 of the l968 Housing
Act, Section l09 of the l974 Housing and Community Development Act, the Civil
Rights Act of l964, Executive Order ll246, and the Davis-Bacon Act.
   (C)   In addition to price, the following are bid evaluation criteria which
may be used with varying weight dependent upon the particular procurement to be
made. The criteria and their weights will be established by the invitation for
bids.
      (1) The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and
efficiency of the contractor.
      (2) The ability of the vendor to provide the material or service promptly
or within the time specified, without delay or interference.
      (3) The quality of performance by the vendor on previous contracts,
orders, or services.
      (4) The ability of the vendor to provide future maintenance and service
for all equipment purchased from the vendor.
   (D)   The criteria upon which a bid will be awarded will be established by a
review committee which will include, if possible, persons with applicable
technical skills. The Mayor will appoint the reviewers, making certain that
these individuals have no potential conflicts of interest with the firms or
individuals under review. The committee will have no less than three members.
The committee will maintain written records of its deliberations including an
evaluation of each bid received.
   (E)   Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place stated in
the invitation for bids. The city will tabulate the bids at the time of bid
opening. The results of the tabulation and the bid documents will be evaluated
by the review committee which will make recommendations to the city. The city
will make a firm fixed-price contract award in writing to the lowest responsive
and responsible bidder. After the bid award is made by the city, a contract
will be prepared for execution by the successful bidder. After the contract is
signed, all bid deposits will be returned to all unsuccessful bidders.
   (F) The city may cancel an invitation for bid or reject all bids if it is
determined in writing that such is in the best interests of the city. The city
may allow a vendor to withdraw a bid if requested at any time prior to the bid
opening. Bids received after the time set for bid opening shall be returned to
the vendor unopened.
   (G)   In the event that all bids exceed available funds, the city may enter
into negotiations with bidders in accordance with KRS 45A.375.
(Ord. 85-8l7, passed ll-27-85; Am. Ord. 2020-1794, passed 4-23-20)
Penalty, see § 37.99
§ 37.18 COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATIONS.
   (A)   The city will utilize competitive negotiations, regardless of contract
amount, upon a written determination that:
      (1)   Specifications cannot be made specific enough to permit the award
of a bid on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated
bid price; in other words, bidding is not feasible.
      (2)   The services to be procured are professional or personal in nature.
   (B)   With the exception of procurement of certain professional services
(principally engineering services), competitive negotiations will proceed as
follows:
      (1)   Proposals will be solicited through a qualifying official newspaper
advertisement; additionally, a request for proposal may be prepared and mailed
to qualified vendors. The newspaper advertisement must be published at least
seven days and not more than 21 days before the date for receipt of the
proposals. The request for proposal will describe services needed and identify
the factors to be considered in the evaluation of proposals and the relative
weights assigned to each selection factor. The request for proposal will also
state where further details regarding the request for proposals may be
obtained. The request for proposal will call attention to the same regulations
discussed in the bidding process. Requests for proposals will always include
cost as a selection factor except for engineering services.
      (2)   Award must be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined in
writing by a review committee to be the most advantageous to the program, with
price and other factors considered. Evaluations must be based on the factors
set forth in the request for proposal and a written evaluation of each response
prepared. The review committee may contact the firms regarding their proposals
for the purpose of clarification, and record in writing the nature of the
clarification. If it is determined that no acceptable proposal has been
submitted, all proposals may be rejected. New proposals may be solicited on the
same or revised terms or the procurement may be abandoned.
   (C)   For the procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional
services, an alternative to request for proposals may be used. The city may
publish a request for qualifications. Requests for qualifications are handled
in a similar method to request for proposals with the exception that cost is
not a factor in the initial evaluation. A review committee will evaluate the
responses and rank them by comparative qualifications. The highest scoring
person or firm will be contracted and the selection committee will negotiate
cost. If the committee is unable to negotiate a satisfactory cost arrangement,
the second highest scoring person or firm will be invited to negotiate. The
committee will maintain a written record of all such negotiations.
(Ord. 85-817, passed 11-27-85; Am. Ord. 2020-1794, passed 4-23-20)
Penalty, see § 37.99
§ 37.19 NONCOMPETITIVE NEGOTIATIONS.
   (A)   Noncompetitive negotiations may be used for procurements in excess of
$7,500 when bidding or competitive negotiations are not feasible. The city may
purchase goods and services through noncompetitive negotiations when it is
determined in writing by the Mayor that competitive negotiation or bidding is
not feasible and that:
      (1)   An emergency exists which will cause public harm as a result of the
delay caused by following competitive purchasing procedures; or
      (2)   The product or service can be obtained only from one source; or
      (3)   The contract is for the purchase of perishable items purchased on a
weekly or more frequent basis; or
      (4)   Only one satisfactory proposal is received through request for
proposals or request for qualifications; or
      (5)   The state has authorized the particular type of noncompetitive
negotiation (for example, the procurement of services by an Area Development
District).
   (B)   Procurement by noncompetitive negotiation requires the strictest
attention to the observation of impartiality toward all suppliers. The
Commonwealth of Kentucky must approve all procurements by noncompetitive
negotiation when only one supplier is involved or only one bid or response to a
request for proposal/request for qualifications is received.

participate or have an interest in the selection or in award or administration
of any procurement transaction if a conflict of interest, real or apparent,
exists.
   (B) A conflict of interest occurs when the official, employee, or designated
agent of the city, partners of such individuals, immediate family members
within a first degree relationship by affinity or consanguinity, or an
organization which employs or intends to employ any of the above who has a
financial or other interest in any of the firms selected for an award.

violation was committed shall be final, and that the offender shall be deemed
to have waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court.
   (D)   After issuing a citation to an offender, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall notify the Code Enforcement Board by delivering the citation to the City
Clerk, or his/her designee. The Code Enforcement Officer, in the exercise of

citation within seven days of the date of issuance by either paying the civil

seven days the offender shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing
and the determination that a violation was committed shall be considered final.

the offender shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order
to District Court. Notice of the final order shall be provided to the offender
in the manner prescribed in division (F) of this section.
   (D)   All testimony shall be taken under oath and recorded. Testimony shall
be taken from the Code Enforcement Officer, the offender, and any witnesses to
the violation offered by the Code Enforcement Officer or offender. Formal rules
of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and
shall govern the proceedings.
   (E)   The Code Enforcement Board shall, based on the evidence, determine
whether a violation was committed. If it determines that no violation was
committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered. If it determines
that a violation was committed, the Board may issue an order upholding the
citation and may order the offender to do either or both of the following: pay
a civil fine in an amount up to the maximum authorized by the ordinance or
remedy a continuing violation within a specified time to avoid the imposition
of a fine, as authorized by ordinance.
   (F)   Every final order of the Code Enforcement Board following a hearing
shall be reduced to writing, which shall include the findings and conclusions
of the Board and the date the order was issued. A copy shall be furnished to
the person named in the citation. If the offender named in the citation is not
present when the final order is issued, the order shall be delivered to that
person by regular first-class mail, certified mail, return receipt requested;
by personal delivery; or by leaving the notice at the person's usual place of
residence with any individual residing therein who is 18 years of age or older
and who is informed of the contents of the order.

manner as any civil action under the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure. The
District Court shall conduct a de novo review of the final order.

   (A)   The city shall possess a lien on property owned by the person found by
a non-appealable final order of the Code Enforcement Board, or by a final

Officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the
regularity of the proceedings conducted pursuant to this chapter.

against the person and shall have the same remedies as provided for the
recovery of a debt.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall otherwise affect the rights or
obligations between the owner of the premises and those who claim a security
interest in the premises.

§ 40.41 NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.
   (A)   The city shall implement a system for notification to lienholders that
meets the minimum requirements of division (B) of this section and shall comply
with the procedures to permit remedial action by lienholders as provided in
division (C) of this section in order to obtain and maintain the lien priority
over previously filed liens granted pursuant to applicable law.
   (B)   The city shall create a notification system that provides lienholders
and others that elect to do so with electronic notifications of all Final
Orders entered pursuant to
Chapter 40 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Murray, Kentucky. This
system shall meet the following minimum requirements:
      (1)   An individual or entity (hereafter, individually, registrant;
collectively, party) may register with the city to receive information on each
final order issued by the Code Enforcement Board by providing a name, mailing
address, phone number, and an electronic mailing address to the city. The city
shall accept this information in any form submitted by a registrant. It shall
be the responsibility of the registrant to maintain and update its contact
information with the city, except that the city shall inform a registrant of
any evidence the city receives that the electronic mailing address is invalid
or not functional in order to provide the registrant an opportunity to submit
an updated electronic mailing address.
      (2)   No less than once a month, the city shall send electronic mail
notification of all final orders issued pursuant to the provisions of
Chapter 40 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Murray since the last date
of notification to each registrant or party registered pursuant to division (A)
of this section. The notification shall, at a minimum, include or provide an
electronic link to a document or database meeting the requirements of this
division that includes:
         (a)   The name of the person charged with a violation;
         (b)   The physical address of the premises where the violation
occurred;
         (c)   The last known mailing address for the owner of the premises
where the violation occurred;
         (d)   A specific description of the citation leading to the final
order, including the citation detail required by §

full citation;
         (e)   The findings of the final order, including the penalty or
penalties imposed by the final order, which may be satisfied by providing a
copy of the full final order; and
         (f)   The status of the final order in regard to its ability to be
appealed, except that the city shall provide an update to registrants if an
appeal is filed on a final order.
      (3)   The city shall post the notification required under division (B)(2)
of this section or provide a summary of the information regarding each final
order in a conspicuous place on the city's public website, within ten days of
the issuance of the final order. If the city posts using summary form, the
summary shall be calculated to reasonably allow identification of the specific
properties which may be impacted by the lien. Upon written request, the city
shall provide the complete record of a final order without charge.
      (4)   City shall maintain the records created under this section for a
period of ten years following their issuance.
   (C)   A registrant who is a lien holder of record may, within 45 days from
the date of issuance of notification under division (B)(2) of this section,
correct the violation if it has not already been abated, or elect to pay all
civil fines assessed for the violation and all charges and fees incurred by the
city in connection with the enforcement of the chapter, including abatement
costs. This section shall not prohibit the city from taking immediate action if
necessitated under § 40.31 of this chapter.
   (D)   The lien provided by §
40.40 of this chapter shall not take precedence over previously recorded liens
if:
      (1)   The city failed to comply with the requirements of division (B)(2)
of this section for notification of the final order; or
      (2)   A prior lienholder corrected the violation or paid all civil fines
assessed for the violation and all charges and fees incurred by the city in
connection with the enforcement of the ordinance, including abatement costs
within 45 days as provided in division (C) of this section.
   (E)   A lien that does not take precedence over previously recorded liens
under the circumstances outlined in division (D) of this section, shall, if the
final order remains partially unsatisfied, take precedence over all other
subsequent liens except liens for state, county, school board and city taxes.
   (F)   Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the city from
recording a lien before the 45 day period established in division (C) of this
section expires. If the lien is fully satisfied prior to the expiration of the
45 day period established in division (C) of this section, the city shall
release the lien in the Office of the Calloway County Clerk within fifteen (15)
days of satisfaction.
   (G)   The failure of city to comply with this section or the failure of a
lien to take precedence over previously filed liens as provided in this
section, shall not limit or restrict any other remedies that the city has
against the property or the offender.
   (H)   The requirements of this section shall not be mandatory for city's
compliance with or enforcement of KRS 65.8840 or the former KRS 381.770.
(Ord. 2016-1715, passed 11-10-16)
§ 40.42 IMMEDIATE ACTION BY CITY.
   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the city from taking immediate action
to remedy a violation of an ordinance when there is reason to believe that the
existence of the violation presents imminent danger, a serious threat to the
public health, safety, and welfare, or if in the absence of immediate action,
the effects of the violation will be irreparable or irreversible.

UTILITY CUSTOMER SERVICE
§ 50.01 MUNICIPAL UTILITY SERVICES AND APPLICATION FOR SERVICE.
   (A)   The city, through ordinances established by the City Council, shall
provide the city and its inhabitants with natural gas, water/waste water,
sanitation and storm water services either by contract or by works of its own;
shall make regulations for the management thereof; and shall set prices for all
customers within and outside the city based on federal and state rules and
regulations for City Council approval.
   (B)   Each prospective customer desiring gas, water, waste water,
sanitation, and/or storm water services shall be required to complete a Murray
Municipal Utilities (MMU) application for service form before service will be
initiated by the Utilities. Proper identification is required and must be
provided at the time of application. A service contract may be required for
certain commercial and industrial customers whose service requirements vary
from what the Utilities consider as being standard. See §
51.12(C).
   (C)   The city shall use reasonable consistency in supplying service but
shall not be liable for breach of contract in the event of, or for loss, injury
or damage to persons or property resulting from interruption of service,
excessive or inadequate water pressure, loss of profits, or otherwise
unsatisfactory service, whether or not caused by negligence as may be
determined by a court of proper jurisdiction. The city recommends that
commercial and industrial customers purchase business interruption insurance,
if available, to secure payment against any such losses.
(Ord. 711, passed 7-24-80; Am. Ord. 93-998, passed 3-25-93; Am. Ord. 2022-1836,
passed 12-8-22)
§ 50.02 DEPOSIT.
   (A)   A minimum deposit for each utility service requested prior to any
services being provided shall be required from customers to secure payment for
services. For all commercial and industrial customers, a deposit or suitable
guarantee equal to twice the average estimated monthly bill shall be required
before service is initiated. For residential customers, a minimum gas deposit
for mobile homes, rental dwellings, and apartments shall be one hundred dollars
($100.00). A minimum water/sewer deposit required for mobile homes, rental
dwellings, and apartments shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). No deposit
shall be required for homeowners for water/sewer or gas service.
   (B)   Deposits will earn interest at the rate of three percent (3%) per year
(not compounded). Interest will be paid at the time the deposit is refunded or
at the time it is applied against a the customer's final bill. The three
percent (3%) interest will apply to all deposits presently being held.
   (C)   Murray Municipal Utilities may, at its option, return deposits to the
customer after one (1) year. The utility may require any commercial or
industrial customer to increase their deposit if inflation or increased use of
service has caused the deposit to be less than a two (2) months' average bill.
   (D)   Murray Municipal Utilities may refuse or discontinue service to a
customer if payment of a requested deposit(s) is not made.
   (E)   Upon termination of service, the deposit, any principal amounts, and
any interest earned and owing, shall be credited to the final bill with any
remainder refunded to the customer.

§ 50.03 CONNECT FEES AND SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   Murray Municipal Utilities may utilize special nonrecurring charges to
recover customer-specific costs incurred related to services performed or
action taken that would otherwise result in monetary loss to the utility or
increased rates to other customers to whom no benefits would accrue. MMU shall
relate any charges directly to the service performed or action taken and shall
yield only enough revenue to pay the expenses incurred in rendering the
service.
   (B)   The customer shall pay a fifty-dollar ($50.00) connection fee for
initial turn-on or connect for each meter service requested in his or her name
(water or gas). Customers shall pay a seventy-five dollar ($75.00) reconnect
fee when the service was disconnected due to non-payment. When reconnection is
requested during the fall after being disconnected at the request of the
customer non-heating months, the reconnection fee shall be fifty dollars
($50.00). Customers will be exempt from the fifty-dollar ($50.00) connect fee
per meter when a read and transfer work order is requested for new services. A
returned payment service charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) will be assessed for
checks returned by a bank or other financial institution for nonpayment. If the
service is disconnected due to tampering with the metering equipment or
intentional destruction of metering equipment, the actual cost of repair and
reconnection shall be charged prior to service restoration.
   (C)   Murray Natural Gas System is solely responsible for the service line,
up to and including, the meter. The customer's certified gas merchant is
responsible for installing the customer's lines from the meter to and into the
house, installing the equipment and appliances utilizing natural gas, lighting
pilot lights, repairing leaks, and maintaining the natural gas system for the
customer from the meter to and throughout the house. Murray Natural Gas
personnel will then turn on the meter, time the meter, and leave the premises.

§ 50.04 BILLING AND COLLECTION OF BILLS.
   (A)   Murray Municipal Utilities shall bill each customer on one (1) monthly
bill for payment of all gas, water, waste water, storm water, and sanitation
services and usage due under this chapter. The bill shall show each separate
service charged for and the total for all services, to be collected and
enforced together. All monthly charges rendered for gas, water, waste water,
storm water, and sanitation services shall be due and payable fifteen (15) days
after the date of the bill. Failure to receive a bill shall in no way release
the customer from due dates or other obligations to pay for services.
   (B)   Bills for metered services shall be determined by meter registration
unless the meter fails to register, in which case a bill shall be rendered
based on previous average consumption for comparable months.
   (C)   Bills for services used, paid on or before the due date, shall be
payable at the net amount. Payments made after the due date will be subject to
a late payment charge. The late payment charge for all classes of customers
shall be five percent (5%) of all monthly charges excluding arrearage and
taxes. If the due date falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a city government observed
holiday, the next business day following will become the due date. If
remittance is made by mail, the postmark date will become the date of the
payment.
   (D)   Whether or not any service is disconnected because of delinquency, the
City Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to enforce and collect the
amount of any bills remaining delinquent for thirty (30) days or longer
(including, but not limited to, penalty, interest, disconnect charge, attorney
fees, and court costs) by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (E)   The City Director of Finance or his or her designated representative
may enter into a written and signed agreement with current customers who are
not able to pay their utility bill on a timely basis. The agreement shall
include language that, in the sole and absolute discretion of the city’s
Finance Director, the customer must pay any current bill plus a reasonable
portion of the prior debt with interest of one and one-half percent (1.5%)
compounded monthly, on an installment basis. The agreement shall not exceed
twelve (12) months. If the customer fails to meet the terms in the agreement,
service shall be discontinued. The city may further proceed to collect the
delinquent amount, including any penalty or interest on the unpaid balance,
disconnect charge, reasonable attorney fees, and court costs.
   (F)   Bills may be paid by mail, at Customer Service, Murray Municipal
Utilities, located in the lobby of Murray City Hall at 500 Main Street or by
the drive-thru window located on ground level with entrance in rear of City
Hall.

§ 50.05 DISCONTINUANCE OR REFUSAL OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Discontinuance of service for nonpayment of utility bill. Murray
Municipal Utilities (MMU) may discontinue or refuse services to customers for
nonpayment of or outstanding indebtedness for utility services. If payment of
the utility bill has not been received by Murray Municipal Utilities on or
before the due date stated on the bill, a second notice, the written
termination notice, shall be mailed to the customer. If payment has not been
received on or before the tenth (10th) day following the due date of the bill,
MMU will send its service technician to the customer's premises, and services
will be discontinued (unless, according to the service technician's judgment,
discontinuance of service would endanger life or property.) Failure to pay any
part of the utility bill as rendered will subject all services to be
discontinued unless arrangements for payment have been made with the city’s
Director of Finance.
   (B)   Refusal of service for outstanding indebtedness. New service may be
refused to any customer who has a delinquent account with MMU for any type of
past service. If an application for service is approved for a former customer
who still owes for past service, the balance due for the past service shall
become an arrears on the new account established by the applicant. If a
customer has service at more than one location and terminates service at one of
the locations, any delinquent balance resulting from the termination shall
become an arrears on the billing for one of the other locations at which the
customer is being served. Service may be refused if it is evident to MMU that
the applicant is living in arrears on the billing for one of the other
locations at which the customer is being served. Service may be refused if it
is evident to MMU that the applicant is living in the same dwelling at the same
location with a former customer who still owes for former services rendered by
the utility.
   (C)   Discontinuance or refusal of service for reasons other than
nonpayment. Murray Municipal Utilities may refuse to connect service or may
discontinue service for the violation of any municipal, state or other rules
and regulations, schedule of rates and charges, or any contract between the
utility and the customer. For purposes of this chapter, tampering with a meter
is considered theft of services within the meaning of the Kentucky Penal Code.
The utility may discontinue service to the customer without advance notice if
it has evidence that any of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   Unauthorized service by illegal use or theft;
      (2)   Theft of gas or water or for the appearance of theft devices on the
premises;
      (3)   Supplying or selling of gas, water, or sewer waste water service to
other persons or premises without a written permit; or
      (4)   Waste or failure to maintain service lines beyond the meter owned
by the customer.
   (D)   Discontinuance of service for dangerous condition. If, in the sole and
absolute discretion of the Field Operations Manager or designee, a dangerous
condition relating to a utility's service that could subject a person to
imminent harm or result in substantial damage to the property of the utility or
others is found to exist on the customer's premises, the service shall be
refused or terminated without advance notice.
   (E)   Should any property owner or customer construct a fence or other
barrier, allow untethered animals, install plants, shrubbery, or any other
obstruction that impedes MMU's ability to access, service or read the meter, a
notice to remove such obstruction shall be issued. If the obstruction is not
remedied by the property owner or customer, the customer's gas service shall be
relocated at the property owner or customer's expense and a civil penalty may
be charged according to §
51.99(B).
   (F)   The discontinuance of service by MMU for any cause does not release
the customer from his or her payment obligation to MMU for any services
rendered.
   (G)   Customer's right to due process. When any service is discontinued or
terminated for reasons other than imminent danger, the customer has a right to
appeal and to due process under the law. See §
50.16, Customer Complaints and Appeals Process.

§ 50.06 RECONNECTION CHARGE.
   (A)   If service has been discontinued by Murray Municipal Utilities for
nonpayment of a bill or inability to read the meter due to animals hazardous to
the MMU employee, a charge of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per utility service
must be paid by to MMU by the customer before 3:00 p.m. for service to be
reconnected on the date the fee is paid, otherwise, service may not be restored
until the next business day.
   (B)   If service is disconnected due to tampering with metering equipment or
intentional destruction of metering equipment, a civil fine as set forth in §
50.99 may be levied, in addition to the actual cost of repair, to include
labor, supplies and equipment, a reconnection fee shall be collected before
service is restored plus a fifteen percent (15%) administrative fee charge.
   (C)   A fifty-dollar ($50.00) reconnect fee shall be charged for gas
customers who request continuance of gas service after voluntarily having
service discontinued during non-heating months.

§ 50.08 METER TESTS.
   Murray Municipal Utilities shall, at its own expense, make periodic tests
and inspections of its meters in order to maintain a high standard of accuracy.
MMU shall, upon written request of the customer, make one additional test or
inspection of that meter at no charge to the customer if that request is not
made more frequently than once each twelve (12) months. The customer shall be
given the opportunity to be present at the requested test. If test results on a
customer's meter show that the meter is within two percent (2%) accuracy, slow
or fast, there shall be no adjustment made in the customer's bill and a test
charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be charged to the customer. If the
meter shows an average meter error greater than two percent (2%) fast or slow,
an adjustment will be made in the customer's billing for only the billing
period immediately prior to the test date and the bill shall be recomputed and
adjusted to either provide a refund to the customer or collect an additional
amount of revenue from the under-billed customer. If the customer is refunded
an amount due to over-billing, the cost of making the test shall be borne by
MMU.

in person, in writing, or by telephone if no contractual obligations are
violated. The customer shall not be responsible for charges for service beyond
the three (3) day notice period if the customer provides access to the meter
during the notice period. If the customer notifies MMU of his or her request
for termination of services, the customer has the burden to prove that service
termination was requested if a dispute arises. Notice to discontinue service
prior to the expiration of the contract term will not relieve the customer from
any minimum or guaranteed payment specified by the contract.

(Ord. 2022-1837, passed 12-8-22)
§ 51.04 POWERS AND REQUIREMENTS OF GAS PERSONNEL.
   (A)   MNG responsibilities. MNG is responsible for installing natural gas
distribution service lines, piping, gas mains, saddles or taps, first shut off
valves, the meters and the service regulators for the location set forth in the
customer's application for service, whether that customer be an individual
property owner, business, school, university, hospital, industry or other
entity. Only MNG personnel may turn the meter on or off. If the customer
requires the meter to be turned off for any reason, the customer or customer's
authorized agent must contact MNG and schedule a time for shut off or turn on.
If work is being performed, the licensed gas professional shall never operate
any part of the distribution system, including the meter. MNG personnel will
turn the meter off for work to be performed, and turn the meter on according to
established safety standards after repairs are completed. MNG will also time
the meter when the meter is turned on, after repairs or additions to the
customer's piping. If the meter is turned off by personnel other than MNG, a
twenty-four- (24-) hour chart test shall be required before the gas can be
turned back on.
   (B)   MNG is solely responsible for the service line up to and including the
meter. MNG shall refuse to turn on gas until the customer's licensed gas
professional has repaired all gas leaks so disclosed. MNG personnel shall then
turn on the meter, time the meter, and leave the premises.
   (C)   MNG personnel shall be subject to the orders and directions of the
Director of Public Works and/or the Murray Natural Gas Field Operations
Manager, and they are vested with full authority to enter any structure,
building or other premises at any reasonable time in the discharge of their

for connection to Murray natural gas system, to pass on, approve, or reject any
such applications received, to keep a daily record of all applications
received, and to make a monthly report of natural gas operations to the
Council, if requested.
   (E)   MNG personnel shall witness the licensed gas professional selected by
the customer leak test customer gas piping and venting for structures in the
course of new construction and/or when new service lines are added. In
addition, MNG gas personnel shall check reported gas leaks and turn off the
meter for the licensed gas professional and turn it back on when the licensed
gas professional has completed all work on the customer's gas issues. At the
time MNG turns the meter back on, MNG personnel will time the meter.
   (F)   MNG gas personnel shall give the owner or agent in charge of any
structure, written notice of any visible issues with the gas piping or venting
when evaluating a potential leak call or when observing the air or soap test on
new service piping, so that the licensed gas professional can evaluate and make
any necessary changes or repairs. It is the responsibility of the property
owner or customer to engage a licensed and certified gas professional to
install, maintain and repair all gas appliances, including lighting of the
pilot light, and to ensure that such appliances are functioning consistent with
the code and all applicable rules and regulations. If the owner or agent fails
to comply with this notice, MNG shall turn off the gas, and shall not
thereafter turn the gas back on again until the licensed gas professional has
completed the necessary repairs. MNG personnel shall time the meter prior to
turning on the gas.
   (G)   It shall also be the duty of MNG personnel to investigate all alleged
violations of the provisions of this chapter, to discuss issues and situations
that arise with the Field Operations Manager, to issue imminent danger notices
or potential hazard notices as needed, and/or to file complaints when
necessary.
   (H)   No one except an employee of Murray Natural Gas System shall at any
time operate any valve of any type or in any way tamper or make any connection
with any gas main, meter, meter connection or gas service pipe between the main
and the meter under penalty of law. However, in the event of extenuating
circumstances, the Director of Public Works and/or the Gas Field Operations
Manager, are authorized to allow emergency responders to turn off gas at the
service line valve.

defect on any installation, construction, maintenance, alteration or repair
performed by the customer or his or her selected licensed gas professional or
from any other service or action taken by the gas professional or customer that
occurs on customer's piping and appliances as defined herein.
   (D)   Any time the licensed gas professional's licensure is suspended or
revoked or any time the licensed gas professional fails to renew his or her
license and fails to notify Murray Natural Gas, such activity shall subject the
licensed gas professional to a civil penalty of two hundred and fifty dollars
($250.00) for each such offense, which may be recovered in a civil action in
the nature of debt if the offender does not pay the penalty within the time
period prescribed by the Code Enforcement Officer or the Code Enforcement
Board, should the offender request a hearing.

barrier, allow untethered animals, install plants, shrubbery, or any other
obstruction that impedes MNG's ability to access, service or read the meter, a
notice to remove such obstruction shall be issued. If the obstruction is not
remedied by the property owner or customer, the customer's gas service shall be
relocated at the property owner or customer's expense and a civil penalty may
be charged according to §
51.99(A).

§ 51.07 PROPERTY OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   No property owner shall cause, or permit, any installation,
construction, reconstruction and/or repair of any gas house piping in the city
and its gas service territory without first engaging the services of a licensed
gas professional.
   (B)   Property owner and/or customer responsibilities. Within the city and
its gas service territory, the construction, installation, reconstruction and
repair of all customer piping, gas appliances, gas furnaces, equipment,
fixtures and apparatus, located inside the structure and/or attached to the
customer side of the meter are the sole responsibility of the customer and/or
the licensed gas professional selected by the customer. MNG's responsibility
stops at the meter installed by MNG. Customers maintain sole and absolute
responsibility for maintenance, repair, inspection and installation, and for
having appliances and piping on the customer side of the meter checked
periodically for leaks and good functionality by the licensed gas professionals
of their choice. (Penalty, see §
51.99)
   (C)   Institutional customers, including, but not limited to, schools,
universities, hospitals, and industrial plants, that are composed of multiple
buildings and structures utilizing gas piping, fixtures and appliances
throughout the institution and/or who employ specialized licensed gas personnel
to install, repair, maintain and/or operate the institution's natural gas
system, on a daily basis, shall be solely responsible for repairs, replacement,
scheduled inspections, maintenance, and monitoring of any and all gas lines and
apparatus downstream from the customer meter as well as all natural gas
utilizing equipment in the entity's gas system, including, but not limited to,
boilers, furnaces, powerhouses, industrial ovens, coolers, condensers, and
refrigeration systems. All design, construction, installation, reconstruction,
repair, replacement, maintenance and inspection of any type conducted by the
institutional customer shall be done according to the NFPA 54 ANSI Z223.1,
National Fuel Gas Code, and all applicable state and federal regulations as
well as the city code. MNG shall maintain full responsibility for the provision
of the distribution service line up to and including the meter. The customer
bears total responsibility for all customer piping. Further, MNG shall remain
available for consultation regarding potential gas leaks and other situations
deemed potentially hazardous and, in those cases where imminent danger has been
determined to exist.
   (D)   If state or federal rules and regulations, NFPA 54, ANSI Z223.1
National Fuel Gas Code or Murray Code of Ordinances are not, in the sole and
absolute discretion of MNG, being adhered to by the institutional customer or
if MNG, in its sole and absolute discretion, has concerns regarding the manner
in which the institution's gas system is being managed or monitored, the city
reserves the right to master meter the institution, effectively placing them
under the regulatory authority of the Public Service Commission (PSC) for the
State of Kentucky. The city would identify a boundary where meters would be set
and read, leaving the regulatory requirements inside the boundary to the PSC.
   (E)   No property owner or any other person or entity may build any type of
structure, whether permanent or temporary, on top of an existing gas line. If
any person or entity builds any structure over a gas line within the city's
natural gas service territory in violation of this chapter, MNG shall relocate
the line to an appropriate location unencumbered with building or structure and
do so at the property owner, person or entity's expense and a civil penalty may
be charged according to city code §
51.99(A).
   (F)   The City of Murray reserves the right to require the property owner
and his/her licensed gas professional to rectify any infraction of the rules,
even though the work has passed licensed gas professional and MNG evaluation
and a final certificate of compliance so verifying has been issued.
(Ord. 2022-1837, passed 12-8-22; Am. Ord. 2023-1856, passed 12-14-23)

or character of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the POTW. The
Supervisor of the Water Resource Recovery Facility may deny or condition the
new introduction or change in discharge based on the information submitted in
the notification or additional information as may be requested.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.21 PROHIBITED CONNECTIONS TO PUBLIC SANITARY SEWER.
   (A)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement wall
seepage or floor seepage, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other
sources of surface runoff or groundwater, to a building sewer or building drain
which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
Any such connections which already exist on the effective date of this chapter
shall be allowed to remain until such a time as renovation, repairs or new
construction are initiated. Upon completion of such renovation, repairs or new
construction, any prior connections of downspouts, basement wall or floor
seepage, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface
runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or drain which is connected to a
public sanitary sewer in any manner, shall be completely and permanently
disconnected from the city's public sanitary sewer system. The owner(s) of any
building sewers having such connections, leaks or defects shall bear all costs
incidental to removal of such drain sources and/or connections. Pipes, sumps,
and pumps for such sources of ground and surface water shall be separate from
wastewater facilities. Removal of such sources of water without presence of
separate facilities shall be evidence of drainage to a public sanitary sewer.
   (B)   Floor, basement, or crawl space drains which are lower than ground
surfaces surrounding the building shall not be connected to the building
sanitary sewer.
   (C)   Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customer's
side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than that of the
customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be permitted. Further,
the customer allowing any unlawful extension of customer service lines shall
immediately have services terminated and be subject to a fine for theft of
services.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.22 DESIGN AND INSTALLATION OF BUILDING SEWERS.
   (A)   All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of
the building sewer shall be borne by the property owner. The property owner
shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
   (B)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except that where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear of the
building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway. In that case, the
building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and
the whole considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and shall not
assume any obligation or responsibility for any damages caused by or resulting
from any such single connection aforementioned.
   (C)   Permit and inspection fees for new buildings using existing building
sewers shall be the same as for new building sewers. If additional sewer
customers are added to the old building sewers, additional sewer tap fees shall
be charged accordingly even though no new sewer tap is actually made into the
city system.
   (D)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary
sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by a method approved by
the Wastewater Inspector and discharged to the building sewer. The property
owner shall bear any cost for a lift station above and beyond the usual and
customary lift method utilized.
   (E)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
conform to the applicable rules and regulations of the city. All such
connections shall be made gastight and water- tight. Any deviation from the
prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Wastewater
Inspector before installation.
   (F)   The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the
sewer lateral provided by the Murray Sewer System. A cleanout must also be
provided by the property owner or customer at the point of connection to the
city's collection system.
   (G)   When the building sewer is ready for connection to the public sewer,
the applicant for the building sewer shall notify the Murray Sewer System. The
connection shall be made under the supervision of the Murray Sewer System.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
GENERAL CONDITIONS AND DISCHARGING WASTES
§ 52.30 CONDITIONS FOR DISCHARGING WASTES.
   (A)   Approval by Murray Sewer System. The following described substances,
materials, waters, or wastes, shall be limited in discharges to Murray Sewer
System to concentration or quantities which: will not harm the sewers,
wastewater treatment process, or equipment; will maintain and protect the water
quality in the receiving stream; and will not otherwise endanger life, limb,
public property, or constitute a nuisance. Murray Sewer System, in its sole and
absolute discretion, may establish additional limitations or limitations more
stringent than those established in the provisions below, if, in its opinion,
more severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming
an opinion as to the acceptability of a discharge, the Murray Sewer System
shall consider such factors, including but not limited to, the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the wastewater treatment process
employed, capacity of the water resource recovery facility, and degree of
treatability of wastes in the water resource recovery facility.
   (B)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any trucked or
hauled pollutants except at designated discharge points and at such times as
designated by the POTW (40 CFR 403.5(b)). Pollutants from non-domestic sources
that are transported to the POTW by truck (or rail) are subject to the general
pretreatment regulations and may be subject to the categorical pretreatment
standards.
      (1)   Any person who transports septic tank, seepage pit or cesspool
contents, liquid industrial wastes or other bulk liquid wastes and wishes to
discharge such wastes to the public sewer system shall first have a valid
septage hauler's discharge permit. All applicants for a septage hauler's
discharge permit shall complete an application form, the waste hauler
questionnaire, pay the appropriate fee, and receive a copy of the Murray Sewer
System's requirements governing discharge into the sewers of liquid wastes from
trucks. All persons receiving such permits shall agree, in writing, to abide by
all applicable provisions of this chapter, and any other special provisions
that may be established by the city as necessary for the proper operation and
maintenance of the sewer system. In addition, any person holding a valid permit
and wishing to discharge to the water resource recovery facility (WRRF), shall
submit a sample at the request of the Supervisor or his designee, at the time
of discharging into the WRRF. Fees for sampling and analysis will be recovered
from each permit holder. Permit requirements may be obtained from the
Department of Public Works and Utilities on Andrus Drive or from the
Pretreatment Coordinator at 90 CC Lowry Drive, Murray, Kentucky.
      (2)   The POTW may require waste haulers to document the source of wastes
being discharged, potentially requiring manifests which should include; general
hauler information, information on the waste generator (name, address and
telephone number), type of wastes collected, volumes, known or suspected
pollutants, and certification that the load is not a hazardous waste. Both a
POTW and hauler self-monitoring may be instituted to verify that the waste has
not affected the POTW.
      (3)   It shall be illegal to discharge any bulk liquid waste into any
manhole or other part of the public sewer system, or any building sewer or
other facility that discharges to the public sewer system. Any liquid waste
hauler illegally discharging to the public sewer system or discharging
wastewater not authorized in the permit shall be subject to immediate
revocation of discharge privileges and further subject to the penalties and
enforcement actions prescribed in §
52.99, including fines and imprisonment.
      (4)   Waste haulers who have been granted permission to discharge to the
public sewer system shall pay fees for such discharge in accordance with a fee
schedule established by the city.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.31 RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; GENERAL.
   (A)   A user may not introduce into a POTW any pollutant(s) which cause pass
through or interference. These general prohibitions and the specific
prohibitions in §
52.43 apply to each user introducing pollutants into a POTW whether or not the
user is subject to other national pretreatment standards or any national,
state, or local pretreatment requirements.
   (B)   (1)   A user may not introduce into the POTW, any water or waste
containing the following chemical constituents or similar objectionable or
toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with
other pollutants, which: injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment
process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, cause Murray Sewer System to
violate the terms of its KPDES permit, prevent the use of acceptable sludge
disposal methods, or exceed a limit set forth in a categorical pretreatment
standard. The following limits are established to protect against pass through
and interference:
Pollutant Parameter Daily Maximum Concentration
                    (mg/l)
Pollutant Parameter Daily Maximum Concentration
                    (mg/l)
Arsenic             1.07
Cadmium (T)         0.093
Chromium (T)        2.77
Hexavalent Chromium 0.55
Copper (T)          0.44
Cyanide (T)         0.24
Iron                10
Lead (T)            0.11
Mercury             0.016
Nickel (T)          1.00
Selenium            0.16
Silver (T)          0.34
Zinc (T)            2.61
 
      (2)   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is
discharged into the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for
total metal unless indicated otherwise. Mass limitations may be imposed in
addition to the concentration-based limitation. All industrial users must
comply with these limitations where they are more stringent than applicable
state and/or federal regulations. Based upon the sampling program at the Bee
Creek Water Resource Recovery Facility, these values may be adjusted to reflect
Murray Sewer System's needs; the city shall give public notice of any change
proposed for these limits.
   (C)   The following discharges are restricted to those users with written
approval by the appropriate city, state or federal approval authority:
      (1)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor-
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the Murray Sewer System as necessary, after treatment of the
composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal, or other
public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
      (2)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes licensed by the Federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and of such half-life or concentration as may exceed
limits established by state or federal regulations.
      (3)   Materials which exert or contain:
         (a)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids, including, but
not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate;
         (b)   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions);
         (c)   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the POTW; and
         (d)   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
slugs.
   (D)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the water resource recovery
facility effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (E)   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the Murray Sewer
System in an individual wastewater discharge permit or in the general permit.
   (F)   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes, or
concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.32 FATS, OILS AND GREASE MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Scope and purpose. Management of fats, oils and grease is essential to
protect the City of Murray Sewer System, including, but not limited to, its
collection systems, pumping stations, and water resource recovery system, from
the discharge of excess fats, oil and grease (FOG) by food service
establishments (FSEs). The accumulation of fats, oils and grease at any point
along the Murray Sewer System's collection and treatment system can cause
blockages which can lead to sanitary sewer overflows. In addition to sewer
back-ups into homes and businesses, property damage, and disruption of business
activities, these overflows can cause the degradation of water quality in the
receiving waters of Kentucky, adversely impact Murray Sewer System operations,
increase the cost of sewer services, and violate the Clean Water Act. In order
to manage the disposal of fats, oils and grease into the collection system with
minimal disruption and cost, the Murray Sewer System has established design
standards, procedures and/or guidelines to regulate FSE operations and the
appropriate disposition of FOG wastes pumped from FSE grease control equipment
(GCE) during routine maintenance.
   (B)   Definitions for fats, oils and grease management.
      "ADDITIVES." Include, but are not limited to, products that contain
solvents, emulsifiers, surfactants, caustics, acids, enzymes, and bacteria.
      "AUTOMATIC GREASE REMOVAL UNIT/ACTIVE GREASE RECOVERY UNIT (AGRU)." GCE
then separates the FOG from the AGRU as effluent is flushed down the drain.
Solids are separated on a daily basis and the AGRU maintains its efficiency
throughout the life of the unit. FOG is skimmed automatically and transferred
into a collector bin for easy removal and recycling.
      "EXEMPTION." A release from the requirement to install grease control
equipment (GCE). Exemptions are approved by Murray Sewer System based on
responses to questions on the Murray Sewer System request for exemption form.
      "EXTENSIVE REMODELING." Modifications made to an existing food service
establishment (FSE) sufficient to require issuance of a building permit, or the
temporary closure of the FSE for building renovation.
      "FATS, OILS & GREASE (FOG)." Organic polar compounds derived from animal
and/or plant sources. FOG may be referred to as "grease" or "greases" in this
section.
      "FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT (FSE)." Any establishment, business, facility
or user engaged in preparing, serving, or making food available for
consumption. Single-family residences are not FSEs. FSEs will be classified as
follows:
         (a)   Class 1: Deli: engaged in the sale of cold-cut and microwaved
sandwiches/subs with no frying or grilling on site; ice cream shops and
beverage bars as defined by North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) 722515, and mobile food vendors as defined by NAICS 722330.
         (b)   Class 2: Limited-service restaurants: (i.e. fast food
facilities) as defined by NAICS 722513 (establishments primarily engaged in
providing food services where patrons generally order or select items and pay
before eating) and caterers as defined by NAICS 722320 (establishments
primarily engaged in providing single event-based food services, having
equipment and vehicles to transport meals and snacks to events and/or to
prepare food at off-premise sites).
         (c)   Class 3: Full service restaurants: as defined by NAICS 722511
(establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who
order and are served while seated and pay after eating).
         (d)   Class 4: Buffet and cafeteria facilities: as defined by NAICS
722514 (establishments, known as cafeterias, grill buffets, or buffets,
primarily engaged in preparing and serving meals for immediate consumption
using cafeteria-style or buffet serving equipment, such as steam tables,
refrigerated areas, display grills, and self-service nonalcoholic beverage-
dispensing equipment).
         (e)   Class 5: Institutions: (i.e. schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.)
as defined by NAICS 722310 (establishments primarily engaged in providing food
services at institutional, governmental, commercial, or industrial locations of
others based on contractual arrangements with these types of organizations for
a specified period of time. The establishments of this industry provide food
services for the convenience of the contracting organization or the contracting
organization's customers. The contractual arrangement of these establishments
with contracting organizations may vary by type of facility operated (e.g.,
cafeteria, restaurant, fast-food eating place), revenue sharing, cost
structure, and personnel provided).
      "GARBAGE DISPOSAL." A kitchen appliance designed to grind food particles
to a small enough size to dispose to a sink drain.
      "GREASE (BROWN)." Fats, oils and grease that are discharged to the grease
control equipment, or from kitchen or food prep wastewater.
      "GREASE (YELLOW)." Fats, oils and grease that have not been in contact
with or contaminated from other sources (water, wastewater, solid waste, etc.)
and can be recycled.
      "GREASE CONTROL EQUIPMENT (GCE)." (Also referred to as FOG interception
equipment, FOG equipment). Devices for separating and retaining FSE wastewater
FOG prior to entering the Murray Sewer System. The GCE is constructed to
separate and trap or hold fats, oils and grease substances to prohibit them
from entering the Murray Sewer System. GCE should only receive kitchen
wastewater. Devices include grease interceptors, grease traps, automatic grease
removal units, or other devices approved by Murray Sewer System.
      “GREASE INTERCEPTOR (GI) (also known as gravity grease trap).” GCE
identified as a large multi-compartment tank, usually one thousand (1,000) to
two thousand (2,000) gallon capacity with proper inlet and outlet T's, and
other necessary components, that provides FOG control for a FSE. Usually
constructed of concrete, fiberglass, or steel. No sanitary wastewater (black
water) line should be connected to the grease interceptor. Grease interceptors
will be located outside the FSE and should be inspected monthly and pumped out
and cleaned on a regular basis.
      "GREASE RECYCLE CONTAINER." A container used for the storage of yellow
grease.
      "GREASE TRAP (GT)." GCE identified as an "under the sink" trap, a small
container with baffles, or a floor trap. For an FSE approved to install a
grease trap, the minimum size requirement is the equivalent of a thirty-five
(35) gallon per minute/seventy (70) pound capacity trap. Grease traps shall
have flow control restrictors and a vent pipe. No dishwasher, or sanitary
wastewater (black water) line shall be connected to an "under sink" or floor
grease trap. See also passive grease trap.
      "MULTI-UNIT FACILITY." A single building or facility with multiple
separate but adjoining units, each with separate plumbing and possibly other
facilities.
      "NAICS." North American Industry Classification System. http://
www.census.gov/eos/www/nai_cs.
      "PASSIVE GREASE TRAP." (Also known as passive hydromechanical grease
trap, under the sink grease trap, grease trap). GCE that slows the flow of
wastewater to allow it to cool and separate into three (3) layers: FOG, solids,
and clear water. The FOG forms a "grease mat" at the top of the unit. Water
flows out through a pipe fixed lower than the layer of grease, but above the
solids layer. As the interceptor fills, it gradually loses efficiency,
requiring frequent emptying and cleaning.
      "SERIES." (Grease interceptors installed in series). Grease interceptor
tanks are installed one after another in a row and are connected by plumbing
pipe.
      "SIGNIFICANT REMODELING." Modifications made to an existing FSE
sufficient to require issuance of a building permit or the temporary closure of
the FSE for building renovation or as deemed necessary by the City of Murray
Department of Planning.
      "SINGLE SERVICE KITCHEN." An FSE that does not prepare food onsite (heat
and serve only) and which uses only disposable service ware (utensils and
dishes).
      "TEE OR T (INFLUENT AND EFFLUENT)." A T-shaped pipe extending from the
ground surface below grade into the grease interceptor to a depth allowing
recovery (discharge) of the water layer located under the layer of FOG.
Influent and effluent T's are recommended to be made of PVC-schedule 40 or
equivalent material. Influent T's should extend two-thirds (2/3) of the grease
interceptor water depth, and effluent T's should extend to within twelve (12)
to fifteen (15) inches of the bottom of the interceptor tank to prevent short
circuiting.
      "WATER (BLACK)." Wastewater containing human waste, from sanitary
fixtures such as toilets and urinals.
      "WATER (GRAY)." Wastewater other than black water as defined in this
section.
   (C)   Any water or waste, vegetable oils, animal fats, or grease, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred (100) mg/l or containing substances
which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two degrees
(32°) F and one hundred fifty degrees (150°) F (zero degrees (0°) C and sixty-
five degrees (65°) C) shall not be discharged into the sanitary sewer system.
Any wastewater treatment system which violates this requirement will be charged
an additional eighteen cents ($0.18) per pound for any discharge in excess of
one hundred (100) mg/l.
   (D)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. Garbage grinders may
be connected to sanitary sewers from homes where garbage originates from the
preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the premises.
Grinders are discouraged in motels, institutions, restaurants, hospitals,
catering establishments or similar places because the ground garbage will go
into their traps and interceptors and cause the solids to increase and meet
and/or exceed the twenty-five percent (25%) limit more quickly thus decreasing
their efficiency and resulting in more frequent pumping. All food service
establishments must have their tanks or traps pumped at a frequency such that
not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total volume is made up of FOG
and solids. After such designated point, the efficiency is decreased and the
FSEs will be sending FOG through the sanitary sewer lines.
   (E)   General requirements for food service establishments:
      (1)   All FSEs shall meet the requirements of the City of Murray Fats,
Oils, & Grease Management Policy.
      (2)   FSEs shall install and maintain appropriately sized GCE.
      (3)   GCE shall be installed, operated, properly maintained, and repaired
at the sole expense of the FSE owner/operator.
      (4)   Every structure of the facility shall be constructed, operated and
maintained in a manner to ensure the discharge of FOG is directed solely to the
FOG management equipment. No valve or piping bypass equipment which may alter
or prevent the designed operation of the FOG management equipment/GCE is
allowed.
      (5)   No FSE shall discharge fats, oils, and/or grease in concentrations
at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration that either alone, or in
interaction with other substances, causes interference with the city wastewater
system, pass through of the system, contributes to a blockage in the collection
system, or constitutes an adverse environmental impact.
      (6)   All FSEs are required to maintain records of annual certification,
cleaning and maintenance of GCE. GCE maintenance records include, at a minimum,
the following:
         (a)   Date of cleaning/maintenance;
         (b)   Company or person conducting the cleaning/maintenance;
         (c)   Volume (in gallons) of grease wastewater removed; and
         (d)   Final disposal location (i.e. landfill, or disposal location of
waste hauler*). *A grease waste hauler completed manifest that includes all the
minimum information mentioned above will meet this requirement.
      (7)   GCE maintenance records shall be maintained at the FSE premises and
provided to Murray Sewer System and/or Health Department upon request.
      (8)   The FSE shall maintain GCE certification and maintenance records
for three (3) years.
      (9)   Grease control equipment certification requirements:
         (a)   All establishments with grease control equipment must have their
grease interceptor or grease trap inspected and certified annually by an
approved grease waste hauler or certified plumber.
         (b)   If a grease interceptor or grease trap satisfies all of the
certification requirements, proof of certification shall be sent to Murray
Sewer System Pretreatment Coordinator within five (5) days. No further action
is required.
         (c)   If a grease interceptor or grease trap fails to satisfy any of
the certification requirements, then a corrective action response is required
by the FSE owner per subsection (E)(10)(b) below. Certification forms [Grease
Interceptor Certification (Form A), Grease Trap Certification (Form B), or AGRU
Certification (Form C)] must be completed and signed by the grease waste hauler
or plumber, as well as the FSE owner or authorized representative, and
submitted to Murray Sewer System Pretreatment Coordinator.
         (d)   The original certification form must be submitted within ten
(10) days from the date of certification to the following address:
   Murray Public Works
   Attn: Pretreatment Coordinator
   200 Andrus Drive
   Murray, KY 42071
      (10)   Effluent limits:
         (a)   At no time shall the pH of the wastewater discharged from the
FOG management equipment prior to mixing with any other wastewater from the
facility be less than six (6) nor greater than nine (9).
         (b)   At no time shall the concentration of fats, oils, and grease in
wastewater from the FOG management equipment, prior to mixing with any other
wastewater from the facility exceed one hundred (100) milligrams per liter. All
analyses shall be conducted according to the current method as listed in Title
40 CFR 136.
      (11)   Failure of grease interceptor or grease trap certification:
         (a)   In the event of a failed grease interceptor certification or
grease trap certification, the FSE owner or authorized representative is
responsible for notifying Murray Sewer System of the failure within twenty-four
(24) hours from the time the FSE becomes aware of the circumstances.
         (b)   A written submission must be provided within five (5) days of
the time the FSE becomes aware of the circumstances. The written submission
should provide detailed "corrective action response" information on the grease
interceptor certification form or the grease trap certification form that is
submitted to the city. If necessary, additional pages may be attached to the
certification form. At a minimum, the "corrective action response" information
must include the reason for the failed certification, what corrective action
will be taken to correct the problem, and the date the corrective action will
be completed. The written submission must be submitted to the following
address:
   Murray Public Works
   Attn: Pretreatment Coordinator
   200 Andrus Drive
   Murray, KY 42071
         (c)   Upon completion of the required corrective actions, a new
certification must be submitted to the address noted above.
      (12)   Best management practices (BMPs) shall be observed by all FSEs for
controlling the discharge of FOG from their facility. Examples of BMPs include:
         (a)   Recycle waste cooking oil; dispose in grease recycle bin or
container. Do NOT pour any grease into sinks, floor drains or mop sinks.
         (b)   Post "NO GREASE" signs above all kitchen sinks as a reminder to
employees.
         (c)   "Dry wipe" and scrape into a trash container as much food
particulates and grease residue from pots, pans, and plates as possible.
         (d)   Use strainers in sink drains and floor drains to prevent large
food particles from going into the sewer line.
         (e)   If an oil and grease spill should occur, clean up using "dry"
oil absorbent material or use ice to make grease solidify. Scoop up and dispose
into a trash container. Do NOT wash oil or grease into drains.
         (f)   Dispose of food items in the trash. Food grinder use is
discouraged due to buildup of solids in the GCE, which causes decreased
efficiency and increased pumping frequency of the GCE.
         (g)   Educate and train all employees on grease control and prevention
of sewer pipe clogs and sewer overflows.
      (13)   FSEs shall dispose of yellow grease in an approved container, or
recycle container, and the contents shall not be discharged to any sanitary
sewer line, storm water grate, drain, or conveyance.
      (14)   Grease trap waste should not be mixed with yellow grease into the
grease recycle container. Yellow grease, oils or grease, poured or discharged
into the FSE sewer lines or city wastewater system is a violation of this
chapter.
      (15)   FSE shall not push or flush the non-water portion of GCE into the
public sewer.
   (F)   Grease control equipment installation requirements:
      (1)   Grease control equipment must remove fats, oils, and grease to
prevent a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration that either alone, or in
interaction with other substances, causes interference with the city wastewater
system, pass through of the system, or constitutes an adverse environmental
impact. Failure to comply with this requirement shall result in an enforcement
action in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   Waste from garbage grinders used for the grinding of plastic,
cardboard, expanded polystyrene foam (i.e. Styrofoam®) or paper products, inert
materials or garden refuse shall not be discharged into a community sewer. For
preparation of food consumed on the premises (food grinder), there is a "food"
grinder exception but only where applicable fees are paid, and such grinders
must shred the waste to a degree that all particles will be carried freely
under normal flow conditions prevailing in the community sewers. Furthermore,
waste from food grinders shall not be discharged into grease control equipment.
At this time, Murray Sewer System is not charging fees for food grinder use;
however, users should be aware that a charge may be levied. Use of a grinder is
not recommended.
      (3)   The GCE shall be water-tight and constructed of concrete or other
durable material. It shall be located so as to be accessible for convenient
inspection and maintenance. No permanent or temporary structures or containers
shall be placed directly over the GCE.
      (4)   Dishwashers should not be plumbed to the GI if the pre-rinse system
is in place: only the pre-rinse system should be plumbed to the GI. For GIs
with the dishwasher plumbed to the GI (in addition to the pre-rinse) the GI
size shall be increased a minimum of thirty percent (30%) of the sizing
requirement. Thirty percent (30%) is required to prevent short-circuiting of
the GI when the extremely hot water from a dishwasher is introduced to the GI.
      (5)   Existing food service establishment requirements:
         (a)   An existing FSE shall be required to submit a FOG plan to Murray
Sewer System for approval within thirty (30) days of notification by Murray
Sewer System. The FOG plan shall include:

         (b)   An existing FSE may submit to Murray Sewer System, for review
and approval, a FOG plan comprised of a grease control equipment alternative to
the minimum GCE required based on the FSE's classification. The alternative
equipment shall be comparable to the minimum required GCE in its effectiveness
to prevent FOG from entering the sanitary sewer system.
         (c)   At a minimum, kitchen and sanitary waste shall be plumbed as
described in the "new food service establishment" subsection (f)(6).
         (d)   The submitted FOG Plan shall include a proposed timeframe for
implementation of the plan. Murray Sewer System will review that FOG Plan
submitted by the FSE. The FOG plan may be approved as submitted or may be
approved subject to such revisions and modifications as Murray Sewer System
determines in its discretion to be necessary for the proper protection of the
city wastewater system.
         (e)   In the case that GCE is determined to be impractical or
physically impossible to install, a variance for compliance may be granted if
substantial evidence is provided by the owner of the FSE. It shall be the sole
discretion of Murray Sewer System to grant or deny a variance. A variance shall
become invalid at such time as the FSE changes categories or undergoes
substantial remodeling.
         (f)   If the discharge exceeds the design criteria of the grease trap/
FOG interceptor, the permittee shall be required to remove and replace the GCE
or provide supplemental treatment by installing additional indoor and/or
outdoor FOG management equipment.

         (d)   All of the FSE's internal plumbing shall be constructed to
separate sanitary (restroom) flow from kitchen process flow. Sanitary flow and
kitchen process discharges shall be approved separately by Murray Sewer System
and shall discharge from the building separately. The kitchen process line(s)
shall be plumbed to appropriately sized GCE. Kitchen process lines and sanitary
lines may combine prior to entering the public sewer; however, the lines cannot
be combined until after passing through the GCE. Existing FSEs shall comply
with this chapter.
         (e)   If the discharge exceeds the design criteria of the grease trap/
FOG interceptor, the permittee shall be required to remove and replace the GCE
or provide supplemental treatment by installing additional indoor and/or
outdoor FOG management equipment.
      (7)   New multi-unit facilities.
         (a)   New strip malls or strip centers must have two (2) separate
sewer line connections at each unit within the strip mall or strip center. One
(1) sewer line will be for sanitary wastewater and one sewer line will be for
the kitchen area, or potential kitchen area, of each unit. The kitchen area, or
potential kitchen area, sewer line will be connected to floor drains in the
specified kitchen area, and will connect, or be able to connect, to other food
service establishment kitchen fixtures, such as a three (3) compartment sink,
two (2) compartment sink, pre-rinse sink, mop sink and hand wash sink.
         (b)   New multi-unit facility owners or new strip mall facility owners
shall contact Murray Sewer System prior to conducting private plumbing work at
the multi-unit facility site. Multi-unit facility owners, or their designated
contractors, shall have plans for separate private wastewater lines for kitchen
and sanitary wastewater for each unit. In addition, the plans shall identify
"stubout" locations to accommodate a minimum of a one thousand (1,000) gallon
grease interceptor for each unit of the multi-unit facility. New multi-unit
facility, or new strip mall facility, owners shall ensure that suitable
physical property space and sewer gradient are available to accommodate the
installation of an exterior, in-ground grease interceptor when determining the
building location.
         (c)   An FSE located in a new multi-unit facility shall have a minimum
of a one thousand (1,000) gallon grease interceptor installed, unless that FSE
is identified as a Class I FSE. Class I FSEs are exempt from the requirements
to install grease interceptors. Neither sanitary wastewater nor Black Water,
shall be connected to GCE.
      (8)   Variance to grease interceptor installation. At the discretion of
Pretreatment Coordinator, some FSEs may receive a variance from the required
installation of a grease interceptor.
      (9)   Approval of grease control equipment. All existing FSEs that have
installed new grease control equipment, new FSEs, FSEs that are planning to
upgrade their facilities, or FSEs that are planning to reactivate any
establishment, business, or facility as an FSE following twelve (12) months of
noncontinuous use as an FSE, shall contact Murray Sewer System Wastewater
Inspector for final approval of the proposed grease control equipment. This
will include onsite inspection of the grease control equipment by Murray Sewer
System Wastewater Inspector. Failure of the FSE to contact Murray Sewer System
to conduct the inspection of the new GCE will result in an enforcement action
again the FSE owner.
      (10)   Grease control equipment sizing.
         (a)   Minimum acceptable size of grease control equipment for each FSE
classification will be as follows:
            1.   Class 1: Deli: engaged in the sale of cold-cut and microwaved
sandwiches/subs with no frying or grilling on site; ice cream shops and
beverage bars, mobile food vendors - twenty-five (25) gpm/fifty (50) pound

etc.) two thousand (2,000) gallon grease interceptor.
         (b)   Pretreatment Coordinator will review GCE sizing information
received from the FOG plan of the FSE's engineer, architect or contractor then
determine whether to approve, or require additional grease interceptor volume,
based on the type of FSE, the number of fixture units, and additional
calculations. Grease interceptor capacity should not exceed two thousand
(2,000) gallons for each interceptor tank. In the event that the grease
interceptor calculated capacity exceeds two thousand (2,000) gallons, the FSE
shall install an additional interceptor of the appropriate size. If additional
interceptors are required, they shall be installed in series.
         (c)   Grease interceptors that are installed in series shall be
installed in such a manner as to ensure positive flow between the tanks at all
times. Therefore, tanks shall be installed so that the inlet invert of each
successive tank shall be a minimum of two (2) inches below the outlet invert of
the preceding tank.
   (G)   Grease interceptor design and installation.
      (1)   Piping Design.
         (a)   The inlet and outlet piping shall have two (2) way cleanout tees
installed.
         (b)   The inlet piping shall enter the receiving chamber two and one-

      (4)   Additional requirements
         (a)    Responsibility. Removal of the grease from the wastewater
routed to a public or private sanitary system is the responsibility of the
user/owner.
         (b)   Location. Grease interceptors shall be located so as to be
readily accessible for cleaning, maintenance, and inspections. They should be
located close to the fixture(s) discharging the greasy wastestream. If
possible, grease interceptors should not be installed in "drive-thru" lanes or
a parking area. Grease interceptor access manholes shall never be paved over.
         (c)   Water-tight. Precast concrete grease interceptors shall be
constructed to be water-tight. A static water test shall be conducted by the
installer and timed so as to permit verification through visual inspection by
the city and other regulatory agency. The water test shall consist of plugging
the outlet (and the inlet if necessary) and filling the tank(s) with water to
the tank top a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours before the inspection. The
tank shall not lose water during this test period. Certification by the
plumbing contractor shall be supplied to the city prior to final approval of
grease control equipment.
         (d)   Construction material. Grease interceptors shall be constructed
of sound durable materials, not subject to excessive corrosion or decay, and
shall be water and gas-tight. Each interceptor shall be structurally designed
to withstand any anticipated load to be placed on the interceptor (e.g.
vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas). NOTE: Concrete materials and
other grease interceptor materials shall meet the American National Standards
Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical
Officials (IAPMO) standards.
      (5)   Marking and identification.
         (a)   Prefabricated gravity grease interceptors shall be permanently
and legibly marked with the following:
            1.    Manufacturer's name or trademark, or both.

            4.   Month and year of manufacture.
            5.   Load limits and maximum recommended depth of earth cover in
feet.
            6.   Inlet and outlet.
         (b)   NOTE: Grout shall not be used as a sealant for the inlet or
outlet pipe at the sidewall.
   (H)   Grease interceptor cleaning/maintenance requirements:
      (1)   Grease interceptor, minimum sized, will be one thousand (1,000)
gallon capacity, and maximum size will be two thousand (2,000) gallon capacity.
If the FSE needs additional capacity, then grease interceptors will be
installed in series.
      (2)   Cleaning: Grease interceptors must be pumped-in-full when the total
accumulations of surface FOG (including floating solids) and settled solids
reaches twenty-five percent (25%) of the grease interceptor's overall liquid
depth. This criterion is referred to as the "25 percent rule". Grease
interceptors shall be cleaned at a frequency of not less than once every ninety
(90) days. Some FSEs may have to pump their grease interceptors on a thirty
(30) day or sixty (60) day schedule to meet the "25 percent rule" criteria. At
no time, shall the cleaning frequency exceed ninety (90) days unless approved
by the city. Approval may be granted on a case-by-case basis after submission
by the FSE of documentation establishing a proper basis for the proposed
frequency.
      (3)   Partial pumping of interceptor contents or on-site pump and
treatment of interceptor contents will not be allowed due to reintroduction of
fats, oils and grease to the interceptor.
      (4)   The grease interceptor effluent-T shall be inspected during
cleaning and maintenance and the condition noted by the grease waste hauler's
company or individual conducting the maintenance. Effluent-T's that are loose,
defective, or not attached must be repaired or replaced immediately.
      (5)   Grease interceptors must be "certified" annually by a grease waste
hauler or plumber. Grease interceptor certification (Form A) must be completed
and submitted to the city annually.
      (6)   All records related to the periodic cleaning of the interceptor
must be retained onsite by the FSE in accordance with this policy.
      (7)   FSE facilities that permanently close for business shall completely
pump out and clean all GIs on the premises and shall fill the GI with water.
Pumping/cleaning of the GI prevents odors and deterioration of the GI from the
weak acid FOG wastewater. Filling the out of service GI with water provides
weight for the GI not to shift position, and provides a barrier from exposure
to further deterioration.
      (8)   Grease trap/FOG interceptors shall be inspected by the food service
establishment at a minimum quarterly, or more frequently as determined by
Murray Sewer System. The FSE must comply with other local ordinance
requirements and state laws concerning more frequent inspecting and cleaning
activities. The authorized agent may require increased of maintenance and
cleaning if the facility is within a problematic FOG area.
   (I)   Grease trap sizing, installation, cleaning and maintenance
requirements:
      (1)   All grease traps shall have a flow control restrictor and be
properly vented. Failure to have the flow restrictor and venting will be
considered a violation.
      (2)   All new FSEs that are required to install grease traps must have
Murray Sewer System and Murray Department of Planning approval prior to
starting operations.
      (3)   Grease trap minimum size requirement is a twenty-five (25) gallon
per minute/fifty (50) pound capacity trap, for Class 1 FSE only.
      (4)   Grease traps must have the Plumbing Drainage Institute
certification, and be installed as per manufacturer's specifications by a
certified plumber.
      (5)   No automatic or manual dishwasher shall be connected to an under
the sink grease trap or floor grease trap.
      (6)   No automatic or manual drip or feed system additive (i.e. enzymes,
emulsifiers, chemical additives, etc.) are allowed prior to entering the grease
trap.
      (7)   A single grease trap device shall be installed for each significant
kitchen fixture unit (i.e., each three (3) compartment sink). Murray Sewer
System must approve the number of grease traps and connections to the grease
traps prior to FSE operation.
      (8)   During cleaning of the grease trap, the flow restrictor shall be
checked to ensure it is attached and operational.
      (9)   Grease traps will be completely cleaned of fats, oils, grease, and
food solids at a minimum of every two (2) weeks. If the FOG and food solids
content of the grease trap are greater than twenty-five percent (25%), then the
grease trap must be cleaned every week, or as frequently as needed to prevent
twenty-five percent (25%) of capacity being taken by FOG and food solids.
      (10)   Grease trap waste should be sealed or placed in a container to
prevent leaking and then disposed, or hauled off site to an approved disposal
location.
      (11)   The FOG interceptor shall be completely emptied by a grease trap/
FOG interceptor cleaner whenever twenty-five (25%) of the operating depth of
the FOG interceptor is occupied by fats, oils, grease and settled solids or a
minimum of once every three (3) months, whichever is more frequent.
      (12)   All pre-rinse sinks, prior to dishwashers must be equipped with an
appropriate drop-in, or below the sink strainer. This is to reduce the loading
of food particles from entering any of the GCE approved by the authorized
agent.
      (13)   All wastewater flows connected to the grease trap/FOG interceptors
shall be screened to prevent solids from entering the treatment units. Screened
solids shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable solid waste
regulations.
   (J)   Automatic grease removal units/active grease recovery unit (AGRU).
      (1)   AGRU(s) shall be installed immediately downstream of each fixture
of multiple fixtures listed in subsection (F)(6)(a) above.
      (2)   The AGRU shall be sized to properly pre-treat the measured or
calculated flows for all connected fixtures or drains.
      (3)   The AGRU shall be constructed of corrosion-resistant material such
as stainless steel or plastic.
      (4)   Solids shall be intercepted and separated from the effluent flow
using an internal or external strainer mechanism, which shall be an integral
part of the unit.
      (5)   The AGRU may not have a bypass valve built into the device.
      (6)   If the unit has a skimming device, automatic draw-off, or other
mechanical means to automatically remove separated fats and oils this automatic
skimming device shall be either hard wired or cord and plug connected
electrically and controlled using a timer or level control.
      (7)   No fixture or drain other than those listed in subsection (F)(6)(a)
of this policy shall be connected to the AGRU unless approved by the authorized
agent.
      (8)   All installations shall be in accordance with local sewer
ordinances, public health code, and state and local plumbing codes.
      (9)   All AGRUs shall be designed and installed in accordance with the
manufacturer"s specifications. All AGRU shall be sized in accordance with the
two (2) minute drain down formula from the Plumbing and Drainage Institute,
Section G101, March 2010 or most recent edition.
      (10)   AGRUs shall be installed for ease of maintenance, replacement and
inspection. The installation is subject to the requirements of all applicable
local plumbing/building codes, state building codes, state plumbing codes,
local ordinances, and approval by the local authorized agent and other laws of
the municipality.
      (11)   The AGRU shall be fitted with an internal or external flow control
device to prevent the exceedance of the manufacturer"s recommended design flow.
   (K)   Approved grease waste hauler program.
      (1)   To protect FSEs and the City of Murray sanitary sewer collection
system and wastewater treatment plant, FSEs in the City of Murray sewer
jurisdiction shall utilize City of Murray Approved Grease Waste Hauler
companies for pumping/cleaning their grease interceptors. Approved grease waste
hauler companies have signed the City of Murray Approved Grease Waste Hauler
Agreement.
      (2)   Approved grease waste hauler companies must have an authorized
representative sign and agree to the City of Murray Approved Grease Waste
Hauler Agreement requirements. The Approved Grease Waste Hauler Agreement
includes requirements for the grease waste hauler company to meet, including
but not limited to the following:
         (a)   Allow City of Murray, or their designated representative, to
audit FSE grease control equipment pumping records and grease disposal records.
         (b)   Require complete pump of grease interceptor contents. No partial
pumping.
         (c)   Provide final disposal location for grease waste.
         (d)   Require that personnel that conduct grease control equipment
cleaning attend and pass a City of Murray approved grease control equipment
certification class.
         (e)   Require monthly reporting to WMD of FSE name, address, grease

in the Murray sewer jurisdiction.
   (L)   FOG minimization and accidental discharge-safeguards.
      (1)   Renderable FOG shall not be disposed of in any sewer, septic tank,
or FOG management equipment. Renderable FOG shall instead be properly recycled
or disposed of in accordance with applicable state, federal and local laws.
      (2)   FSEs shall provide such facilities and institute such procedures as
are reasonably necessary to prevent or minimize the potential for accidental
discharge of fats, oils, and grease into the sewage collection system. This
includes implementation of "best management practices" protocols.
      (3)   FOG scraped or removed from pots, pans, dishes and utensils shall
be directed to the municipal solid waste stream for disposal.
   (M)   "Additives" prohibited for use as grease management and control.
      (1)   Additives include, but are not limited to, products that contain
solvents, emulsifiers, surfactants, caustics, acids, enzymes, and bacteria.
      (2)   This chapter prohibits the use of enzymes, emulsifiers or other
additives to enable oil or grease to pass through the FSE's grease trap or
grease interceptor designed to remove oil and grease. If Murray Sewer System
identifies FOG in the downstream sewer system from a FSE that is using an
additive, Murray Sewer System may require the FSE to discontinue use of the
additive and initiate an enforcement action.
      (3)   Additive use will not be a substitute for regular, required
cleaning or pumping of grease control equipment.
   (N)   Right of entry - inspection and monitoring.
      (1)   Murray Sewer System and its respective authorized representatives
shall have the right to enter the premises of FSEs to determine whether the FSE
is complying with the requirements of the Sewer Ordinances. FSEs shall allow
Murray Sewer System personnel and/or authorized representatives or agents, upon

enter the FSE's premises to determine impacts to the city sewer system.
   (O)   Enforcement response plan for food service establishments and grease
waste haulers. This enforcement response guide (ERG) for food service
establishments (FSEs) and grease waste haulers (GWHs) was developed to ensure
consistent enforcement response to all FSEs and GWH companies that operate in
the City of Murray (city) jurisdiction. This ERG includes responses to fats,
oils, and grease (FOG) related violations of the City of Murray Sewer Use
Ordinance.
      (1)   Significant non-compliance for FSEs and GWHs.
         (a)   The city has defined "significant non- compliance for food
service establishments" as violations that meet one or more of the following
criteria:
            1.    Continued obstruction of the city sewer system that results
in the city having to clean the sewer line segment four (4) or more times in a
twelve (12) month period.
            2.   Causing or contributing to a second sanitary sewer overflow
event or sewer line obstruction that causes a sewer back-up. The "second" event
is based on any previous sanitary sewer overflow that occurred within two (2)
years of the first event.
            3.   No response, or inadequate response, to two (2) notices of
violation received within a twelve (12) month period, or no response to a total
of four (4) notifications in the form of a non-compliance notification or
notice of violation received in a twelve (12) month period.
            4.    Falsification of records, manifests, or other documents
required under the City of Murray Sewer Use Ordinance, Section 18-220.
            5.   Any other violations of a pretreatment effluent limit, or City
Sewer Use Ordinance prohibition that the city determines has caused, alone or
in combination with other discharges interference or pass through at the city
wastewater collection system or wastewater treatment plant.
         (b)   The city has defined "significant non- compliance for grease
waste haulers" as violations that meet one or more of the following criteria:
            1.   Illegal dumping of grease waste, septic waste, portable toilet
waste or other industrial/commercial waste into the City of Murray sanitary
sewer system, storm water system, or any Murray area stream or tributary.
            2.   Chronic falsification of records, manifests, certifications,
reports, disposal location, or other documents. "Chronic" is repeated incidents
of falsification, or demonstration of intent to falsify information.
            3.   No response, or inadequate response, to two (2) City of Murray
notices (e.g. warning letter, non- compliance notification, notice of
violation) received within a twelve (12) month period to correct any deficiency
or error identified by the City of Murray.
            4.   Any other violation or group of violations that the City of
Murray determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the
local pretreatment program, FOG program, or wastewater treatment plant and
sewer collection system.
      (2)   Enforcement actions. Generally, an isolated instance of non-
compliance or Category 1 violation can be met with a warning letter or non-
compliance notification. Any Category 2 to Category 4 violations should be
responded to with an enforceable order that requires a return to compliance by
a specific deadline. Enforcement actions may include the following:
         (a)   Warning letter or verbal warning. Generally issued by an
Environmental Compliance Inspector for a sporadic, non- chronic, or
unintentional deficiency or error in reporting, procedures, or protocol
required by the City Sewer Use Ordinance or Approved GWH Agreement.
         (b)   Non- compliance notification (NCN). Generally issued by an
Environmental Compliance Inspector for Category 1 violations. A NCN informs the
user that an action is required of the user within a specified timeframe
designated by the city, or their designee, to correct the non-compliance on its
own initiative or the non-compliance will require the city to escalate
enforcement action against the user. The NCN documents the initial attempts of
the city to resolve the non-compliance. A required response to a NCN is
normally thirty (30) days.
         (c)   Notice of violation (NOV) generally issued by the FOG Program
Coordinator or General Manager, the notice of violation (NOV) is an official
communication from the city to the non-compliant user that informs the user
that a violation of the city sewer use ordinance or the City of Murray Approved
GWH Agreement has occurred. The NOV is issued when there is no response to a
NCN, minor violation (non-chronic, not repeated) of the Murray Approved GWH
Agreement, a reporting error or omission, or failure to provide the monthly
report after an initial warning. The NOV includes a specific due date for a
written response of corrective action that will be taken. A NOV does not
contain assessment of penalties or cost recovery. Authenticated copies of NOVs
may serve as evidence in judicial proceedings.
         (d)   Consent orders (CO). The City Manager may enter into consent
orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for non- compliance. Such documents shall
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the non-compliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to this
chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
         (e)   Show cause hearing (SCH). The City Manager may order a user
which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the City Manager and
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least thirty (30) days prior to
the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user as defined in this chapter. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
         (f)   Compliance orders (CompOrd). When the City Manager finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Manager may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance
within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the non-compliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW.
A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
         (g)   Cease and desist orders (C&D). When the City Manager finds that
a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are
likely to recur, the City Manager may issue an order to the user directing it
to cease and desist all such violations.
         (h)    Administrative fines (AF). When the City Manager finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Manager may fine such user in an
amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or the maximum fine
allowed under law, whichever is greater at the time of violation. Such fines
shall be assessed on a per violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or
other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation. Refer to city sewer use ordinance for
administrative fines unpaid charges or fines, and users desiring to dispute
such fines protocols.
         (i)   Termination of service (ToS). In addition to the other
provisions of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
            1.    Violation of city sewer use ordinance, or wastewater
discharge permit conditions;
            2.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
            3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
            4.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
         (j)   Civil penalties (CP).
            1.   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be
liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of ten thousand dollars
($10,000) or the maximum fine allowed under law, whichever is greater at the
time of violation, but not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
            2.   The City Manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
            3.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
            4.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
         (k)   Criminal prosecution (CrimPro).
            1.   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than
ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or the maximum fine allowed under law, whichever
is greater at the time of violation, per violation, per day, or imprisonment,
or both.
            2.   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance
into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a monetary penalty, or
be subject to imprisonment, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any
other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under
state law.
            3.   A user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or
other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
chapter, individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring
device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be
punished by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or the
maximum fine allowed under law, whichever is greater at the time of violation,
per violation, per day, or imprisonment, or both.
            4.   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished
by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or the maximum fine
allowed under law, whichever is greater at the time of violation, per
violation, per day, or imprisonment, or both.
      (3)   Penalty assessment. The city has categorized the various types of
violations, and assigned a penalty range to each category. Penalty categories
are determined by using the enforcement response table (attached). All penalty
assessments MUST be approved and signed by the General Manager or his designee.
Penalty amounts are considered to be an economic deterrent to the illegal
activity. Penalty ranges have been designed to recover any economic benefit
gained by the violator through non-compliance.
         (a)   CATEGORY 0 = NO PENALTY.
         (b)   CATEGORY 1 = $1 to $500.
         (c)   CATEGORY 2 = $1 to $1,000.
         (d)   CATEGORY 3 = $1 to $10,000.
         (e)   CATEGORY 4 - DIRECT LEGAL ACTION. Any penalties and/or costs to
be assessed at the maximum penalty allowable by applicable law and included as
part of the legal action.

3. Other Non-compliance
Incident                           Category Level Action Taken
A. Failure to allow City of Murray
inspectors, or their authorized
representative to adequately audit
and inspect the GWH facility or    3              CO w/escalation of actions as
files; or refusal to allow access                 necessary.
or provide files; or undue delay

and applicable pretreatment                       Enforcement Response Guide
standards/regulations.
 
   (P)   Fees.
      (1)   The city may charge inspection, monitoring assessment, impact, and
permit fees to the FSE to cover the cost of implementing and enforcing FOG
provisions contained herein.
      (2)   Permit fees are renewed annually and are based upon an FSE
classification as follows:
         (a)   Class 1: $100.
         (b)   Class 2: $150.
         (c)   Class 3: $200.
         (d)   Class 4: $250.
         (e)   Class 5: $300.
      (3)   Permit fees may be paid at the time the application for an FSE
permit is initiated or renewed.
   (Q)   FOG treatment, disposal and resource recovery plan. Murray Sewer
System, at the discretion of the Director of Public Works and Utilities or
designee, may require the FSE to implement a FOG treatment, disposal and
resource recovery plan. The plan may be implemented if there are any problems
identified with FOG disposal, continued FOG obstruction in the sewer system, or
inconsistent maintenance provided by grease waste haulers to prevent FOG
discharges from FSEs. Any costs incurred by Murray Sewer System for
implementing this program shall be passed on to the FSEs being serviced.
   (R)   Violations and enforcement action.
      (1)   Causes for enforcement action against a food service establishment
(FSE) include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Failure to clean or pump GCE;
         (b)   Failure to maintain GCE including inspection and installation of
properly functioning effluent-T and baffles;
         (c)   Failure to install GCE, failure to certify the grease
interceptor or trap;
         (d)   Failure to control FOG discharge from the FSE;
         (e)   Use of additives so that FOG is diluted and pushed downstream of
the FSE;
         (f)   Failure to certify the grease interceptor or trap;
         (g)    Responsibility for sewer line obstructions;
         (h)    Responsibility for sanitary sewer overflow; or
         (i)   Any other failure of the FSE to comply with the terms and
conditions of this policy.
      (2)   If FSE inspections and field investigations identify any fats, oils
and grease interference or blockage at any point within the sewer system,
including, but not limited to, the sewage pumping station and the water
resource recovery facility (WRRF), that was caused by a particular food service
establishment, then that FSE shall be required to reimburse Murray Sewer System
for all labor, equipment, supplies and disposal costs incurred by Murray Sewer
System for cleaning the interference or blockage, and any administrative fees
incurred. The FSE will be billed directly by Murray Sewer System for such
costs, and failure to reimburse these costs may result in termination of water
and wastewater service.
      (3)   If an FSE fails to pump, clean or maintain its GCE after a notice
of violation due date, Murray Sewer System may pump/clean the GCE to prevent
additional FOG problems downstream. The FSE will be required to pay the cost of
pumping and maintaining the FSE's GCE and the costs of all labor, equipment and
supplies incurred by Murray Sewer System, in addition to any required
administrative fees. Mechanical failure of a GCE will be considered a violation
of this chapter pertaining to the construction and maintenance of pretreatment
facilities and shall subject the FSE to penalties up to one thousand dollars
($1,000) per violation per day.
      (4)   Immediate discontinuance of water and/or wastewater service may
result if the FSE presents an immediate endangerment to the health, welfare, or
safety of persons or to the environment, causes significant interference with
the WRRF or causes Murray Sewer System to violate any condition of its NPDES or
KPDES permits. Service shall be reinstated when such conditions have been
eliminated.
      (5)   The food service establishment enforcement response guide will be
used to assist in determining the appropriate enforcement action.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
PRETREATMENT STANDARDS AND POLLUTION    DISCHARGE LIMITS
§ 52.40 FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   State and/or city requirements and limitations on discharges shall
apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and
limitations.
   (B)   The city reserves the right to establish more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with
objectives presented in this chapter.
   (C)   Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment
standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if
more stringent than limitations proposed in this chapter for sources in that
subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
chapter.
   (D)   All publicly owned treatment works shall have the authority to seek or
assess civil or criminal penalties in at least the amount of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) a day for each violation by industrial users of pretreatment
standards and requirements. Each day that the violation continues constitutes
an additional violation.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.41 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS ON PRETREATMENT OF WASTE FLOWS.
   (A)   Approval on pretreatment of waste flows. If any waters or wastes are
proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated above, water resource
recovery or pretreatment control facilities may need to be installed for an
industry to attain compliance with the city's ordinance. Plans, specifications
and any other pertinent information relating to wastewater pretreatment or
control facilities are required to be submitted to the Murray Sewer System for
review within ninety (90) days prior to installation. Changes to existing
pretreatment or control facilities must also be submitted for review within
ninety (90) days prior to installation.
      (1)   If any waters or wastes are proposed to be discharged to the public
sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics
enumerated in §
52.31(B), the Murray Sewer System may condition approval on one or more of the
following requirements:
         (a)   Pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
         (b)   Control over the quantities and rates of discharge; or
         (c)   Payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)   If the Murray Sewer System conditions approval on the pretreatment
or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and
equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the city and subject
to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. Detailed
plans describing such facilities and their operating procedures shall be
submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the Departments of
Planning and Public Works and Utilities prior to the construction of the
facilities (see subsection (A) above).
   (B)   Where pretreatment or flow equalization facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, the industry shall be solely responsible for
the continued maintenance in satisfactory and effective operating condition of
such facilities at industry expense. Upon direction from the Murray Sewer
System, the Industry shall be responsible for modifying these facilities as
necessary to produce an acceptable discharge under the provisions of this
chapter. In the event essential maintenance requires bypass or if bypass occurs
unexpectedly, the following becomes effective:
      (1)   An industrial user may allow any bypass, defined as the intentional
diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment
facility, to occur only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure
efficient operation and does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements
to be violated. These bypasses must be submitted to the Pretreatment
Coordinator at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass if the
industrial user knows in advance that such bypass is needed.
      (2)   If the bypass is unanticipated, the industrial user shall submit
oral notice within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the industrial user
becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within
five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain the information required in 40 CFR 403.17. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis
if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
   (C)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Pretreatment Coordinator, they
are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable
grease or oil in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other
harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be
constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme
changes in temperatures and shall be of substantial construction, gas-tight,
water- tight, and equipped with easily removable covers, and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In
maintaining these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the
proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and
shall maintain records of the dates, and means of disposal. The Pretreatment
Coordinator may require reporting of such information for review. Any removal
and hauling of the collected material not performed by the owner(s) or their
personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
Interceptors shall also comply with applicable regulations of the Calloway
County Health Department.
   (D)   All new and existing industries discharging to the Bee Creek Water
Resource Recovery Facility that fall into a category defined by USEPA in Title
40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, must comply with the applicable
pretreatment standards. Where the discharge standards of the City of Murray
Sewers Ordinance, the industrial user permit, or the pretreatment standards
conflict, the most stringent of the three shall apply.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.42 SPECIAL INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All significant industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this chapter and achieve compliance with
any applicable federal pretreatment standards and any other applicable
requirements promulgated by the EPA or with any more stringent pretreatment
standards necessitated by local conditions within the time limitations as
specified by the federal pretreatment regulations.
   (B)   Murray Sewer System may require the development of a compliance
schedule for installation of pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any
industrial user that cannot meet discharge limits required by this chapter. Any
facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level required by this chapter
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city prior to
construction of the facility. The review of the plans will in no way relieve
the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
produce an effluent that complies with the provisions of this chapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall
be reported to and be acceptable to the Murray Sewer System prior to the user's
initiation of the changes.
   (C)   Pursuant to the requirements imposed on publicly owned wastewater
treatment works by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972
and later amendments, all pretreatment standards promulgated by the U.S. EPA
for new and existing industrial discharges to public sewer systems are hereby
made a part of this chapter. Any industrial waste discharge which violates
these EPA pretreatment standards shall be in violation of this chapter.
Industrial users are required to notify the POTW and other waste management
authorities of hazardous waste discharges into the POTW. 40 CFR 403.12(p).
   (D)   New sources. Pretreatment standards are based on existing source
industries and new source industries. The term "new source" shall mean any
building, structure, facility or installation from which there is or may be a
discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commences after the
publication of proposed pretreatment standards provided that:
      (1)   The building, structure, facility, or installation is constructed
on a site at which no other source is located;
      (2)   The new source industry totally replaces the process or production
equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source; or
      (3)   The production or wastewater generating processes are substantially
independent of an existing source at the same site.
   (E)   New source industries shall install and have in operating condition
and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet
applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the
shortest feasible time (not to exceed ninety (90) days), new sources must meet
all applicable pretreatment standards.
      (1)   Subject to production-based standards, all industrial users must
comply with all discharge limits calculated under 40 CFR 403.6(c), (304).
      (2)   Each industrial user shall report production rates to the
pretreatment coordinator annually, at a minimum.
   (F)   Conversion of mass limits to concentration limits. When the limits in
a pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per
unit of production, the city may convert the limits to equivalent limits
expressed as effluent concentration limits.
   (G)   Control manhole. When required by state, local or federal rules and
regulations, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such
necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate
observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when
required, shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city.
The manhole shall be installed by the owner at owner expense, and shall be
maintained by owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (H)   Measurements, tests, and analyses. All measurements, tests, and
analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made
in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR 261 EPA
Pretreatment Standards, and the current edition of "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health
Association, the American Water Works Association and the Water Environment
Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at the control manhole which shall be considered to be
the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents on the sewage works and
to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The
particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls
whereas pH is determined from periodic grab samples.
   (I)   Violation notification. If sampling performed by an industrial user
indicates a violation, the user shall notify the Pretreatment Coordinator
within twenty-four (24) hours. The user shall repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results to the Pretreatment Coordinator within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation. Exception to this regulation is only if
the Pretreatment Coordinator performs sampling within the same time period for
the same pollutant in question.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.43 SPECIFIC PROHIBITIONS FOR INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGES.
   The following pollutants shall not be introduced into a POTW by any person
or user:
   (A)   Any water or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids,
gases, vapors, or dissolved gases (such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur oxides and
ammonia), or fumes, in concentrations either singly or by interaction with
other wastes, to injure or interfere with any water resource recovery process,
constitute a hazard to humans or animals, cause acute worker health and safety
problems or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the Water Resource
Recovery Facility.
   (B)   As required by 40 CFR 405(b)(1), no person shall discharge pollutants
which will create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not
limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than one hundred
forty degrees (140°) F or sixty degrees (60°) C using the test methods
specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
   (C)   Discharges containing pollutants having a pH lower than 6.0 or higher
than 9.0, or which will cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW,
equipment or personnel, of the POTW unless the works are specifically designed
to accommodate such discharges.
   (D)   Solid or viscous pollutants in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or resulting in interference with
the proper operation of the sewage works.

Sewer System or the state, 40 CFR Part 403.5.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.44 PROTECTION FROM ACCIDENTAL AND SLUG DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Accidental discharge and slug loading. A slug loading or discharge
means any pollutant discharge of non-routine, episodic nature, including but
not limited to, an accidental spill or a non-customary batch discharge, which
has a reasonable potential to cause interference or pass-through or to violate
the POTW's regulations, local limits or permit conditions in any manner.
   (B)   Users shall promptly notify the Pretreatment Coordinator in advance of
any substantial change in the volume or character of the wastewater
constituents being introduced into the POTW. The Pretreatment Coordinator may
deny or condition the new introduction or change in discharge based on the
information submitted in the notification or additional information as may be
requested. Significant industrial users are required to notify the Pretreatment
Coordinator immediately of any changes at their facilities affecting the
potential for a slug discharge.
   (C)   In the case of all possible or actual accidental discharges and/or
slug loadings, it is the responsibility of all industrial users to immediately
telephone and notify the Supervisor of the POTW or the Pretreatment Coordinator
of an accidental discharge/slug loading. Notification shall include location of
discharge, type of waste, concentrations and volume, and corrective actions.
   (D)   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge or upset (or
within ten (10) days for bypass), the user shall submit to the Pretreatment
Coordinator, a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge
and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences.
This notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish
kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification
relieve the user of fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed by this chapter, the Enforcement Response Plan or other applicable law.
   (E)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or
suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedures. In addition, as required by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v), an
inspection and sampling of the effluent from each significant industrial user
shall be conducted at least one time per year.
   (F)   Protection from accidental discharge. Each significant user shall
provide facilities for protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other regulated wastes and slug discharges governed by this
chapter which adversely affect the POTW. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharge and/or slug discharges of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner's or user’s own cost and expense. Detailed plans
delineating such facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection
shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before construction of
the facility begins. Facilities shall be maintained by the user and available
for inspection at any reasonable time upon request by the Murray Sewer System
representatives. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after January
1, 1984, shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until
accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city and put into
place. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. As required by
40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v), an inspection and sampling of effluent from each
significant industrial user is required at least one time per year.
   (G)   Slug discharge evaluation. Evaluation of the industrial user must
occur at least once every two (2) years to determine whether each significant
industrial user needs to develop or update a plan to control slug discharges.
If the POTW determines that a slug control plan or revision is necessary, the
plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored raw and waste chemicals or other hazardous
materials;
      (3)   Procedures for control or countermeasure of a spill or slug
discharge must be stated and include a twenty-four (24) hour phone number for
reporting accidental spills and for immediate notification to the POTW of slug
discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40
CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within five
(5) days; and
      (4)   If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental
or slug discharge or spills, including, but not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response may be required in the form of a new or modified accidental spill
prevention or slug control plan. Such a new or modified plan may also be
required when there is a significant change in its existing operation or
wastewater constituents or characteristics.
   (H)   Discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   As required by 40 CFR 403.12(p), the industrial user shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and State
Hazardous Waste authorities in writing of any discharge of hazardous waste into
the POTW. The notification report shall be submitted no later than one hundred
eighty (180) days after the discharge of a listed or characteristic hazardous
waste and shall contain the following:
         (a)   The hazardous waste number;
         (b)   Type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other);
         (c)   Volume and mass of discharge; and
         (d)   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261.
      (2)   If the discharge is greater than one hundred (100) Kg/month to the
POTW, the notification must also contain:
         (a)   The hazardous constituents contained in the waste;
         (b)   The estimate of mass and concentration of constituents in the
waste stream; and
         (c)   The amount of waste expected to be discharged in the following
twelve (12) months.

§ 52.45 SCHEDULE OF ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT.
   (A)   If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards or local limits, the industrial
user will be required to submit the shortest schedule by which the user will
provide such additional pretreatment. The completion date in this schedule
shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable
pretreatment standard.
   (B)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment facilities required for an industrial
user to meet the applicable pretreatment months. No later than fourteen (14)
days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the
user shall submit a progress report to the Pretreatment Coordinator, including,
as a minimum, whether or not the user complied with the increment of progress,
the reason for any delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return to
the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse
between such progress reports to the Pretreatment Coordinator and any other
required entities.

sample type and location. All analyses must conform with 40 CFR Part 136 and
amendments thereto;
      (5)   Information concerning all pretreatment equipment used to treat the
facility's discharge; and
      (6)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative as defined in § 31.301 and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance
and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards
and requirements. See §
52.58(C).
   (F)   Documentation associated with best management practices compliance
must be maintained for three (3) years.
   (G)   The Murray Sewer System and those industrial users discharging into
the Murray POTW must maintain the reporting requirements for the POTW and
industrial users according to 40 CFR 403.12, applicable state laws and
regulations and City of Murray Ordinance Chapter 52 Sewers.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.54 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   Murray Sewer System shall inspect the facilities of any user to
ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements
being complied with, POTWs are required to inspect all SIUs at least once per
year pursuant to 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v). Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow Murray Sewer System
representatives ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, copying records, records
examination or in the performance of any of their duties.
   (B)   Murray Sewer System. Approval Authority, and EPA shall have the right
to set upon the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
   (C)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge. All analyses shall be performed by either the Murray Sewer
System Laboratory or a certified contracted laboratory acceptable to Murray
Sewer System. Analytical procedures shall be performed in accordance with 40
CFR Part 136. Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for the Analysis of
Pollutants under the Clean Water Act and amendments or with other test
procedures approved by the EPA. Analytical techniques for additional pollutants
not contained in 40 CFR 136 must be performed by using validated analytical
methods approved by EPA (40 CFR 403.12(g)(5). Sampling shall be performed in
accordance with techniques approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator. Except as
indicated otherwise, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four
(24) hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control
authority. Where time- proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the control authority, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. See 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance.
   (D)   Murray Sewer System may impose mass limitation on users which are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or local requirements,
or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitation is appropriate. In
such cases, all reports shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by
pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain
the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and
the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the
Murray Sewer System, or pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable pretreatment standards. All analyses shall be performed in
accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to Section
304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto or
with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator. Sampling shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator.
   (E)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety
(90) day compliance reports, 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d) set forth the sampling
requirements. For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to
assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant(s) in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication,
"Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants," April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
   (F)   As required by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v), inspection and sampling of the
effluent from each significant industrial user must be conducted at least one
(1) time per year. Exceptions to this requirement include, but may not be
limited to:
      (1)   A pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard, 40
CFR 403.12(e)(3).
      (2)   A user that meets the criteria for classification as a non-
significant categorical industrial user, 40 CFR 403.3(v)(2).
      (3)   An industrial user wherein the effluent is randomly sampled and
analyzed and inspected every two (2) years. If such standards for reduced
reporting are not met, the inspection, analyzing and sampling revert to every
year, 40 CFR 403.12(e)(3).
   (G)   Sampling and monitoring waivers. Murray Sewer System may authorize an
industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego
sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the
industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors
that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and
without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user.
[see CFR 403.12(e)(2)] This authorization is subject to the following
conditions:
      (1)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit.
      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with §
52.02, authorized representative of industrial user, and include the
certification statement as currently stated in Section IV, ADDITIONAL REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS, Heading E, SIGNATORY REQUIREMENTS, Paragraph 3, CERTIFICATION, of
the Wastewater Discharge Permit.
      (5)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Murray Sewer System must
be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the
waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver
must be maintained by the pretreatment coordinator for three (3) years after
expiration of the waiver.
      (7)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements §§
52.52 and
52.53.
      (8)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in pretreatment standards, except as otherwise
specified in the categorical pretreatment standards.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.55 SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE.
   A user is defined as being in significant non-compliance for one or more of
the following:
   (A)   Any discharge causing imminent danger to human health or the
environment or resulting in the exercise of emergency authority under 40 CFR
403 to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (B)   Failure to report non- compliance accurately;
   (C)   Chronic violation defined here as sixty-six percent (66%) or more of
all measurements taken during a six (6) month period that exceed (by any
magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant
parameter;
   (D)   Violation of a technical review criteria (TRC) defined here as thirty-
three percent (33%) or more of all measurements for each pollutant parameter
taken during a six (6) month period that equal or exceed the product of the
daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC
= 1.4 BOD, TSS, Fats, Oil and Grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except
pH);
   (E)   Violation of a pretreatment effluent limit that the control authority
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass-through or has endangered the health of the POTW personnel
or the public;
   (F)   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, failure to comply with
schedule milestones for starting or completing construction or attaining final
compliance by ninety (90) days or more after the scheduled date;
   (G)   Failure to provide required reports within thirty (30) days of the due
date; and
   (H)   Any violation or group of violations, which may include a violation of
best management practices, which the Pretreatment Coordinator determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.

      The rates for each year subsequent to CY 2018 shall remain unchanged
until such time as amended by ordinance.
   (E)   Water meters. In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises
discharges sewage, water, or other liquid wastes, or uses water supplied on
other than a metered basis from either a private or a public water supply, then
the owner or occupant may be required to cause a water meter or other measuring
device to be installed which is acceptable to Murray Municipal Utilities and
the Department of Public Works and Utilities which are in charge and control of
the municipal sewerage system. The quantity of water used, as measured by such
meter, shall determine the sewage rate, rental or charge. Pending installation
of such meter, the sewerage rate, rental, or charge shall be at the prevailing
rates based on a consumption of six thousand (6,000) gallons per month. Said
rate shall be determined by the rate schedules above and applied based on
whether the real property is located inside the city limits or outside the city
limits.
   (F)   Sewer tap-on fees. Each customer applying for a sanitary sewerage
connection to the Murray Water System and water resource recovery system shall
pay the fee set by the following sewer tap-on schedule:
      (1)   Sewer tap-ons, inside city, family residence - effective 07/01/
2016:
         (a)   One thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for each single-
family residence; and
         (b)   Six hundred dollars ($600) for each additional unit located
within the same structure.
      (2)   Sewer tap-ons, outside city effective 07/01/2016:
         (a)   Two thousand one hundred dollars ($2,100) for each single-family
residence; and
         (b)   Eight hundred forty dollars ($840) for each additional unit
located within the same structure.
      (3)   In the event the cost to the city exceeds the above tap-on fees, a
determination of the actual cost shall be made by the Director of Public Works
and Utilities and such cost shall be the responsibility of the water or
sewerage customer.
      (4)   The above tap-on fees are in addition to the water and sewerage
rates presently in effect or which may hereafter be adopted.
   (G)   Sewerage rates and water consumption. Sewerage rates provided in
subsection (D)(1) and (D)(2) above are based on the underlying assumption that
all metered water consumption is eventually returned to the water resource
recovery facility. Where it can be evidenced that the proportion of water
actually returned to the treatment system by an industrial customer is
significantly different from the metered consumption, service charges shall be
determined on the basis of measured or estimated wastewater discharge. The city
reserves the right to determine by whatever means and methods it may find
practicable, the amount of water consumption or wastewater discharge that shall
be used to compute sewerage service charges.
   (H)   Surcharge for excessive strength. Users having a discharge over the
normal sewage strength of three hundred (300) mg/l suspended solids or two
hundred fifty (250) mg/l BOD shall incur an additional charge of sixteen cents
($0.16) per pound of suspended solids, twenty-three cents ($0.23) per pound of
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and thirty cents ($0.30) per pound for oil and
grease over fifty (50) mg/l or limits as specified in the permit for
categorical industries and thirty cents ($0.30) per pound for phosphorus.
   (I)   The foregoing rates and charges for the use of and services rendered
by the Murray Water System and Murray Sewer System as established by
subsections (D) through (H) of this section shall become effective from and
after the date determined by City Council.
(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.61 METHOD OF BILLING.
   (A)   Sewerage service charge shall be billed to each user on a monthly
basis and shall be computed in accordance with each user's water consumption
and strength or toxicity of discharge during the billed-for period.
   (B)   No reduction in sewer charges, fees, or taxes shall be permitted in
the event that certain wastes discharged to the water resource recovery
facility contain pollutants in less concentrations than specified maximum
limitations.
   (C)   Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a
regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the total charge which is

(Ord. 2024-1867, passed 7-11-24)
§ 52.99 ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS.
   (A)   General. The City of Murray, through the designated individual or
committee, to ensure compliance with this chapter, may take the following
enforcement steps against users in non-compliance. The remedies available to
the POTW include, but are not limited to, injunctive relief, civil and criminal
penalties, immediate discontinuance of discharges, and/or water service and the
publishing of the list of significant violators annually. Note that any
violation of the Clean Water Act of 1977 may also be pursued by the state or
the federal government.
      (1)   If any person or public corporation is found to be in violation of
any provision of this chapter, the city may:
         (a)   Enforce these ordinances by mandamus or otherwise;
         (b)   Remove any improper construction or close any connections made
improperly or in violation of these ordinances;
         (c)   Revoke any permit issued pursuant to these regulations;
         (d)   Recover by civil action from any person or public corporation
violating any ordinance; and
         (e)   Pursue any other remedy available by law.
      (2)   The installation of any facility by any person or public
corporation contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a
violation and shall be abated immediately upon notice by the City of Murray.
      (3)   Any person or public corporation found to be operating in violation
of these regulations shall be compelled to cease and desist upon proper
application by anyone aggrieved, including, but not limited to, the city, the
State Board of Health or the Calloway County Board of Health.
      (4)   Any person or public corporation willfully failing to comply with
this chapter shall be liable for damages, including, but not limited to, any
cost by the city for remediating the violations caused by such failure and for
the costs, including, but not limited to, the cost of repairing any
construction damaged or destroyed, any legal fees incurred, and court costs
incurred by the City of Murray.
      (5)   Sewer back-ups or overflows resulting from acts of God which cause
property damage shall not be the financial responsibility of the Murray Sewer
System or any of its employees or the City of Murray.
      (6)   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently
break, damage, destroy, deface, cover or tamper with any wastewater treatment
works which are a part of the water resource recovery system under the Director
of Public Works and Utilities management. Any person violating this provision
shall be subject to immediate prosecution by the local, state or federal
government for any violations involving civil or criminal penalties.
   (B)   Administrative enforcement. Remedies, including, but not limited to,
the following, may be issued by the Mayor or his designee, but are not
necessarily invoked in the order presented:
      (1)   Notice of violation (NOV). An official written communication from
the Mayor or designee, mailed certified, first class, or hand delivered to a
non-compliant user stating that the user is in violation of the city's rules,
regulations or ordinances. Whenever the city's designee finds that an
industrial or any other user has violated or is violating any provision of this
chapter, the Pretreatment Coordinator may serve upon said user, written notice
of the violation. Within ten (10) days from the receipt date of this notice,
the user must evaluate and provide an explanation of the violation and submit a
written plan to the Murray Sewer System for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions to be taken to achieve
compliance and the required steps for insuring that the violation will not
reoccur. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the NOV. The NOV may also
state deadlines for a response, demonstrating compliance has been achieved. The
NOV may be the foundation for further enforcement action.
      (2)   Administrative orders. Enforcement documents issued by the Mayor or
designee, which direct a non-compliant establishment to undertake or to cease
specific activities. This may be the first formal response to significant non-
compliance and may be used as a vehicle for administrative fines.
         (a)   Consent orders. A negotiated settlement between the Mayor or
his/her designee and a user found to be in non-compliance with applicable
pretreatment requirements of the Sewer Ordinance. The Mayor or designee is
hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the
industrial user or any other users responsible for the non- compliance. Such
orders shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
non-compliance within a time period specified by the order. Consent orders
shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued. Consent
orders must be signed by the Mayor or his/her designee and the user
representative and shall be judicially enforceable.
         (b)   Show cause hearing order. An order to direct the user to appear
before a Department of Public Works and Utilities Review Panel, consisting of
the Field Operations Manager, the Supervisor of Water and the Supervisor of the
water resource recovery system, to explain the non-compliance and to show cause
why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not be taken. The
show cause hearing order may be used in circumstances where previous
enforcement actions have failed to resolve the non-compliance. The aggrieved
party can appeal the order to the City of Murray Appeals Board.
            1.   The Mayor or designee may order any industrial user which
causes or contributes to any violation of this chapter or order or wastewater
permit issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
principal executive, general partner or corporate officer of the industrial
user. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as noticed,
immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
            2.   At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony taken
must be under oath and by audio and/or video recording. The transcript, so
recorded, will be made available to any party of the hearing, and any member of
the public upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
         (c)   Compliance order. When the city finds that an industrial or
other user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or
order issued hereunder, the city representative may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge, directing that, following a specified time
period, sewerage service may be discontinued by virtue of restricting or
discontinuing water service unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated.
Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably
necessary and appropriate to address the non- compliance, including, but not
limited to, the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-
monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewerage system. A compliance order may not extend
the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
         (d)   Cease and desist orders. When the city finds that an industrial
or any other user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or those
provisions contained in any permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement or that the user's past violations are
likely to reoccur, the Mayor or designee may issue a cease and desist order.
The order directs a non-compliant user to cease illegal or unauthorized
discharges immediately or directs the termination of the discharge found to be
in violation of this chapter or pretreatment standards or the provisions of a
wastewater discharge permit. The cease and desist order may be used in
situations where the discharge could cause interference or pass through, or
otherwise create an emergency situation. The Mayor or designee may issue an
order to cease and desist all such violations, and direct those persons in non-
compliance to:
            1.   Comply forthwith;
            2.   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth
in the order; and
            3.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
         (e)   Supplemental responses. The remedies provided for in this
chapter are not exclusive. The city may take any, all, or a combination of
these actions against a non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement
subsection provisions. However, the city may take other action against any user
when the circumstances warrant. Further, the individual or committee acting on
behalf of the city may take more than one enforcement action against any non
compliant user. Additional responses are available to the city and include, but
are not limited to, cleaning and repair cost recovery, public notice of
significant non-compliance with pretreatment requirements, increased monitoring
and reporting, short term permits, and permit revocation. In addition, the city
may revoke a best management practices plan waiver for a categorical industrial
user which was issued to allow use by the user in lieu of having to test for
specific pollutant parameters.
      (3)   Administrative fines/penalties. Any user who is found to have
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, or the orders
and permits issued hereunder, or any pretreatment standard or requirement, may
be fined in an amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500), per violation
for lesser instances of non-compliance. Per 40 CFR 403.8 (f)(1)(vi), all POTWs
shall also have authority to seek or assess civil or criminal penalties in at
least the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day per violation for
each violation by industrial users of pretreatment standards and requirements.
Each day on which non-compliance shall occur or continue may be deemed a
separate and distinct violation. Such fines will be added to any surcharges as
a separate line item and billed to the violator. The city shall use such other
collection remedies as it has to collect other service charges. Any such
penalty imposed shall not be construed as liquidated damages and shall accrue
in addition to any liability for any consequential damages resulting from the
violation for which the penalty is imposed.
      (4)   Emergency suspensions.
         (a)   The Director of Public Works and Utilities or designee, after
advising the Mayor of emergency issues associated with actual or threatened
discharges, may, in his/her sole and absolute discretion, immediately suspend
the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater user discharge permit
whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge presenting or causing any of the following conditions:
            1.   An imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or the environment;
            2.   An interference or pass through; and/or
            3.   A violation of any condition of the POTW's NPDES permit.
         (b)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or wastewater user discharge permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate its contribution. A hearing before the City of Murray Appeals Board
will be held within fourteen (14) days of the notice of suspension to determine
whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s wastewater user discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection and water
supply, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, and its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Director of Public Works and Utilities
shall reinstate the wastewater user discharge permit and/or the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge
and that the period of endangerment has passed (see Chapter 134).
         (c)   Any user which is responsible, in whole or part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit to Pretreatment
Coordinator, a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the
city prior to the date of the hearing described.
      (5)   Termination of permit (see §§
52.30 and
52.51). Any user who violates the following conditions of this chapter or a
wastewater user discharge permit or order, or any other applicable er state or
federal law, is subject to permit termination:
         (a)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report significant changes in operations
or wastewater constituents and characteristics, or volume prior to discharge;
         (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; and/or
         (d)   Intentional violation of permit conditions and pretreatment
standards.
   (C)   Judicial enforcement remedies. Means the implementation of the
judicial process to secure court-ordered action to correct violations and to
secure penalties for violations. Judicial administrative remedies may be
sought: (1) when notices of violation or administrative orders have proven
ineffective in returning the violating user to compliance; (2) when emergency
situations require injunctive relief to halt or prevent discharges which
threaten human health or the environment or interfere with the treatment
system; or (3) for imposing civil penalties and recovering losses incurred due
to non-compliance. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other
wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this
chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, the Mayor, through the City
Attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief
in the Circuit Court for Calloway County.
      (1)   Injunctive relief and cost recovery. Whenever a user has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit
issued hereunder, the Mayor, through the City Attorney, may petition the Court
for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both (as may be
appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user.
In the event the city elects to correct the violation itself, the cost of such
correction may be billed to the user causing the violation, and may include,
but not be limited to, all costs for correction of the violation, all costs for
litigation if necessary, and reasonable attorney fees. These costs may be due
to, but not limited to, actual physical damage to the treatment works or
collection system, personal injury to city personnel, damage to the
environment, or other related costs such as for increased testing/monitoring.
The city shall have the same type remedies to collect these fees as it has to
collect other sewerage service charges.
      (2)   Civil penalties.
         (a)   In determining the amount of civil liability, all relevant
circumstances shall be considered, including, but not limited to, the extent of
harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factors as justice
requires. Any user who has violated and/or continues to violate this chapter or
any order or permit issued hereunder, or who violates any cease and desist
order, prohibition, effluent limitation, or pretreatment or toxicity standard,
shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of at least one thousand
dollars ($1,000) but no more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) per violation
per day for as long as the violation continues plus actual damages. In addition
to the above described penalty and damages, the city may recover reasonable
attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, court costs, and other expenses
associated with enforcement activities, including, but not limited to, special
sampling and monitoring expenses. Any such penalty imposed shall not be
construed as liquidated damages and shall accrue in addition to any liability
for any consequential damages resulting from the violation for which the
penalty is imposed.
         (b)   The city may petition the Court to impose, assess, and recover
such sums set forth in subsection (C)(2)(a) above. In determining the amount of
liability, all relevant circumstances shall be taken into account, including,
but not limited to, the economic benefit gained through the user's violation,
corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the user,
and any other factor as justice requires.
      (3)   Criminal violations and prosecution. The City of Murray, in its
sole and absolute discretion, may choose to pursue civil or criminal violations
against users who violate the provisions of city, state or federal ordinances,
rules or regulations.
         (a)   Violations. Any user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this chapter, or any orders, or permits issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall, upon conviction, be guilty
of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars
($500) but not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation, per day,
or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.
         (b)   Falsifying information or data. Any user who knowingly makes any
false statements, representations or certifications in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to
this chapter, or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with,
or knowingly renders inaccurate, any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than
five hundred dollars ($500) nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) per
violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.
         (c)   Destruction of the POTW. No person(s) shall maliciously,
willfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper
with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is part of the POTW. Any
person(s) violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under
charge of disorderly conduct, destruction of public property, or other criminal
statute that is consistent with the offense. It shall be noted that the Clean
Water Act of 1977 does not require proof of specific intent to obtain a
conviction. Note that each day that there is a continued violation constitutes
a separate criminal violation.
   (D)   Additional enforcement action.
      (1)   Annual publication of significant violations. The Pretreatment
Coordinator shall publish, at least annually, in the largest daily newspaper
circulated in the service area, a description of those industrial users who are
found to be in significant violation, as defined by this chapter; with any
provisions of this chapter; or any order or permit issued hereunder during the
period since the previous publication.
      (2)   Performance bonds. The city may decline to reissue a permit to any
industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter
or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such user first files
with it a satisfactory bond, payable to the POTW, in a sum not to exceed a
value determined by the city to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
      (3)   Financial assurance. The city may decline to issue or reissue an
individual wastewater user discharge permit to any user who has failed to
comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous individual wastewater
user discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, unless such user first submits proof that it has
obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the
POTW caused by its discharge.

§ 53.23 EXTENSION OF STREET MAINS.
   Murray Public Works and Utilities will authorize the extension of existing
water and sewer mains where necessary to provide water and sewer service on the
following terms and conditions:
   (A)   When application has been received for water and sewer service
requiring an extension of main to provide such service, or where application
has been received for extensions into a newly developed tract of land, the
applicant will be required to deposit an amount equal to the entire estimated
cost of installing the necessary pipe lines and appurtenances other than
service connections, as determined by the Murray Public Works and Utilities.
   (B)   The deposit will not bear interest.
   (C)   In the case of extension of street mains along streets, arteries, or
easements bordered by parcels of property whose owner elects not to share in
the construction costs of the extensions, hereinafter termed nonparticipating
parcels, the Superintendent of Murray Public Works and Utilities shall bring
before the Council the plans for the proposed extension, with the location and
pipe footage dimensions of all nonparticipating parcels clearly delineated.
      (1)   The Council may declare any or all of the nonparticipating parcels
to be certified nonparticipating parcels, and all those so certified shall be
entered in a ledger maintained by the Superintendent of Murray Public Works and
Utilities exclusively for that use, and labeled certified nonparticipating
property parcel ledger. The following information shall be entered in the
ledger for each parcel of property certified:
         (a)   For the purposes of determining which parcels of property front
on a street main extension, the term "FRONT DIRECTLY" shall mean laying
adjacent to the roadway, artery, or easement on which the line is to be
constructed.
         (b)   Total footage of street main extension constructed.
         (c)   Total cost of construction.
         (d)   Average per foot construction cost.
         (e)   Total footage of each certified nonparticipating property parcel
fronting directly on the street main extension.
         (f)   Owner of each certified parcel.
      (2)   In addition to entering the information concerning construction
costs of lines bordered by nonparticipating parcels in a ledger, the Director
of the System shall cause to be recorded in the proper records of the Calloway
County Clerk the information contained in the certified nonparticipating
property parcel ledger, and the fact that the information is maintained on file
in the office of the Director of Murray Public Works and Utilities. The
Director shall also request the County Court Clerk to enter a notation on the
property deed of each certified nonparticipating parcel calling the attention
of prospective purchases of the property to the classification by the city of
the property as a nonparticipating parcel.
      (3)   No property owned by an applicant for a street main extension shall
be eligible for certification as a nonparticipating parcel.
      (4)   In the case of street main extensions where some parcels of
property fronting on the extension have an unusual amount (large or small) of
frontage in relation to the potential service that might accrue to the parcel
from a future tap-on to the extension, the Council may elect to add to the
nonparticipating classification. The addendums shall be certified by a majority
vote of the Council, and this information shall be entered in the ledger in
addition to the total footage of the parcel fronting directly on the street
main extension.
      (5)   The owner of all nonparticipating property shall be notified of the
pending classification by the Director of Murray Public Works and Utilities
prior to submission of street main extension construction plans to the Council.
This notification shall include a statement encompassing the ramifications of
such a classification, particularly as set forth in division (D) below. The
owner of the property shall again be notified after Council action certifying
their property as nonparticipating. In such nonparticipating parcel addition,
the Director shall cause to be run in a local newspaper a notice of
designation. The second notice required here shall be sent by the Director
prior to the beginning of street main extension construction, and shall notify
the owner of the action taken by the Council.
   (D)   Tap-ons furnishing service to any nonparticipating parcel of property
falling under the purview of division (C) above shall be allowed only after the
applicant for such service has paid to Murray Public Works and Utilities the
proper share of construction due for the line to be tapped on, with interest at
7% per annum from date of certification of the property, in addition to any
fees and costs incurred under division (C)(2).
      (1)   The amount of construction cost due from an applicant for service
shall be computed by multiplying the total number of feet of nonparticipating
property to be served by one-half provided other property, participating or
nonparticipating, lies directly across the roadway, artery, or easement on
which the street main lies, and by the average per foot construction cost of
the line as entered in the nonparticipating parcel construction ledger. In
cases where only the applicant for service can feasibly be served by a
particular section of street main, computation shall be made by multiplying the
total number of feet of nonparticipating property by the factor of one, and
then by the average per foot construction cost of the street main. In cases
where an amount of construction compensation cost has been certified by the
Council and this cost entered in the nonparticipating parcel ledger, this cost,
plus interest, shall be assessed in lieu of any aforementioned computed costs.
Interest, as well as fees and costs incurred under division (C) (2), shall be
construction cost assessment.
      (2)   In the event property originally classified as nonparticipating has
been subdivided, only the footage of the applicant's parcel which fronts the
line shall be considered in computing the amount due from the applicant.
However, any applicant requesting service from a nonparticipating parcel shall
be required to pay the construction cost accrued from the footage of any and
all nonparticipating parcels owned by him which front on the street main from
which service is to be made.
   (E)   Tap-ons to utilities for the purpose of street main extension shall
not be classified as a service tap-on, and shall not fall under the purview of
division (D).
   (F)   Construction costs and interest collected under the purview of
division (D) shall be refunded to the depositor, but shall be subject to
divisions (H) and (I).
   (G)   When and as houses or buildings abutting on street mains that fall
under the purview of division (A) are completed, the house or building occupied
by a bona fide owner or responsible tenant who has entered into a contract for
use of Murray Public Works and Utilities' service, and the parcel of property
from which the service line originated has never fallen under the purview of
division (D), then Murray Public Works and Utilities shall make refunds to the
depositor, but subject to divisions (G) and (H), in amounts calculated as
follows, at the option of Murray Public Works and Utilities, a refund of $100
will be made to the depositor and the refund so computed shall be made only
once for each new customer connected.
   (H)   Under no circumstances shall the total amount of the refunds
(excluding interest accrued under divisions (D)(1), (D)(2), or (F) exceed the
total amount deposited with Murray Public Works and Utilities.
   (I)   No part of any funds collected after ten years is to be returned to
the depositor.

cistern with the facilities of the Public Works and Utilities.
(Ord. 525, passed 9-10-70)
§ 53.25 WATER HAMMER OR SURGES.

automatic equipment, fixtures, facilities, and machinery, so that undue surges
will not occur in the facilities of the Public Works and Utilities and so that
water hammer can be avoided.
(Ord. 525, passed 9-10-70)
§ 53.26 PUBLIC FIRE HYDRANTS.
   (A)   On written instructions of the duly authorized officials of any
municipality supplied by the Public Works and Utilities, the Public Works and
Utilities will install standard fire hydrant, provided that the size of the
existing street main and surrounding distribution system, and the available
pressure on the street main is, in the judgment of the Public Works and
Utilities sufficient to enable the giving of proper service at the fire hydrant
under normal and ordinary conditions. The Public Works and Utilities will
render the aforesaid service at a cost to the municipality in accord with the
then prevailing rate schedule for public fire protection.
   (B)   Whenever a municipality desires a change in location of any existing
fire hydrant, the Public Works and Utilities, on written notice to do so, will
make such changes at the expense of the municipality.

promoting frequent turnover for conducting business-related activities or

objectives of the chapter, and to protect the health, safety and welfare of
both drivers and pedestrians using public rights-of-way.

responded to the notice within seven (7) days, a second notice shall be sent to
the last known address of the registered owner by certified mail. Such notice
shall state that if the owner docs not respond to the notice by cither paying

hearing the person requesting such hearing requests an extension of time not to
exceed fourteen (14) days. Not less than seven (7) days before the date of the

hearing. The notice may be given by certified mail, return receipt requested,
by personal delivery, or by leaving the notice at the person's usual place of
residence with any individual residing therein who is eighteen (18) years of
age or older and who is informed of the contents of the notice. Any person
requesting a hearing who fails to appear at the time and place set for the
hearing shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing to contest the
citation and shall be deemed to have refused to pay the fine levied by the
citation. The Board shall enter a final order determining the violation was
committed and shall impose the appropriate civil penalty. A copy of the order
shall be served on the violator.
   (B)   At the hearing, the Board may consider the parking citation, and any
other written report made under oath by the officer who issued the citation in
lieu of an officer's personal appearance at the hearing. After consideration of
the evidence, the Board shall determine whether a violation was committed.
Where it has not been established that the violation was committed, an order
dismissing the citation shall be entered. Where it has been established that a
violation was committed, the Board shall uphold the citation and order the
owner to pay the citation within seven (7) days. An administrative hearing fee
of fifty dollars ($50) will be added to the amount of the original fine if the
Board upholds the citation. A copy of such order shall be furnished to the
owner. If the fine amount plus the administrative hearing fee is not received
within seven (7) days of the hearing date, a late fee of fifty dollars ($50)
shall be added to the original fine amount. Failure to pay the fine(s) within
an additional seven (7) days may result in a summons being issued in the name
of the registered owner of the vehicle requiring the owner to appear in
Calloway County District Court.
   (C)   An appeal from the Parking Enforcement Hearing Board's determination
may be made to the Calloway County District Court within seven (7) days of the
Board's determination. The appeal shall be initiated by filing a complaint and
a copy of the Parking Enforcement Hearing Board's order in the same manner as
any civil action under the rules of civil procedure. The action shall be tried
de novo and the burden shall be upon the city to establish that a violation
occurred. If the court finds that a violation occurred, the owner shall be
ordered to pay to the city ALL FINES, FEES AND PENALTIES OCCURRING AS OF THE
DATE OF JUDGMENT.

changes that may hereafter be made in the laws of the commonwealth with
reference to alcoholic beverages or other cause outside licensee’s control,
then the city shall refund to licensee the proportionate part of the license
fee for the period during which licensee is prevented from carrying on said

§ 118.023 REGULATORY LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   Pursuant to KRS 243.075, there is hereby imposed a regulatory license
fee on the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of each license issued
by the City ABC Administrator. The regulatory license fee shall be four percent
(4%) of gross sales of all alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. In the case
of retail sales of package distilled spirits and wine, the regulatory license
fee shall be four percent (4%) of gross sales. Thereafter, the City Council
shall adopt at the budget adoption for each subsequent fiscal year, such annual
rate for the regulatory license fee as shall be reasonably estimated to ensure
full reimbursement to the city for the cost of any additional policing,
regulatory, or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic
beverages in the city, not to exceed the current cap imposed by the Kentucky
General Assembly, as amended. Should the city fail to address the regulatory
license fee in any budget, then the regulatory license fee shall remain at the
level at which it was last fixed until such time as the City Council shall
adjust the fee.
   (B)   Payment of such regulatory fee shall be remitted to the city and shall
be held in a separate account maintained for the purpose of fully reimbursing
the city for the estimated cost of any additional policing, regulatory or
administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the city.
The regulatory license fee shall be in addition to any other taxes, fees or
licenses permitted by law, except that a credit against a regulatory license
fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount equal to any license fee imposed
by the city pursuant to KRS 243.070. Payment of the regulatory license fee
shall accompany the tax return approved for such use by the City Council. The
return and payment are due no later than by the end of the month immediately
following each calendar quarter.
   (C)   Failure to pay such quarterly remittance within ten (10) days of the
due date constitutes a violation and subjects licensee to suspension or
revocation.
   (D)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay quarterly remittance by
the due date is five percent (5%) of the tax for each ninety (90) days or
fraction thereof. The total late filing penalty shall not exceed twenty-five
percent (25%) of the tax; provided, however, that in no case shall the penalty
be less than ten dollars ($10.00).
   (E)   Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum will apply to any
late payments.

license within the City, and the ABC Board shall have made a decision regarding
such appeal or protested application, the City ABC Administrator, upon receipt
of notice of finality of the decision, shall enter such orders and take such
action as required by the final order of the ABC Board. As provided by law, and
as used herein, no order of the ABC Board is final until all appeals or appeal
times shall have been exhausted. A “final order” of the ABC Board is the order
entered by said Board, unless an appeal is taken from the Board’s order, in
which case the “final order” is the order entered by the Board upon direction
from the reviewing court of last resort in the final order of said reviewing
court.

(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)
§ 118.053 OTHER CONDITIONS.
   In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations required or
permitted by law:
   (A) The City ABC Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage
license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his place of
business shall have been approved by the City Building Inspector, the City Fire
Marshall, the City Planning Department and any and all other inspections
required by the Kentucky Building Code;
   (B)   All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal background check
and shall sign a waiver allowing the release of this information to the City
ABC Administrator; and
   (C)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be granted or
renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any taxes or fees due
the city at the time of issuing the license, nor shall any license be granted
or renewed to sell upon any premises or property, owned and occupied by the
licensee upon which there are any delinquent taxes or fees due the city.
Further, if a licensee becomes delinquent in the payment of any taxes or any
fees due the city at any rime during the license period, the license to sell
alcoholic or malt beverages shall be subject to revocation or suspension.
   (D)   No person, whether an applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in
any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the City
ABC Administrator, or any member of his or her staff, or any state ABC
administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This division is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or state ABC
Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a
license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for
appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this
section. This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit monetary settlements
in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order or
revocation or suspension, where the ordinance and applicable statutes allow for
such payments in settlement.
(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)
§ 118.054 FORM OF LICENSE.
   All city licenses shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the City
Council and shall contain:

   (B)   The number of the license;
   (C)   The type of license;
   (D)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the licensed
premises;
   (E)   The name and address of the owner of the building in which the
licensed premises are located;
   (F)   The expiration date of the license;
   (G)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a property or

(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)
§ 118.055 CHANGE OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the City ABC Administrator within ten (10) days of the change.
   (B)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The
City ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
      (1)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other
business organization herein, the word “change” is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the
corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than ten
percent (10%) of the total ownership or stock shall require a new license.
      (2)   The following information will be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
         (a)   Name and address;
         (b)   Nature of interest;
         (c)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         (d)   Date of birth;
         (e)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of
Kentucky. If a Murray, resident indicate when residence was established;
         (f)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license
or in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding
a license under this act;
         (g)   Extent of stock or company ownership;
         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in
any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license in any other state or province.
      (3)   This information shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator as
a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten (10) days of any change of required
information.
(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)
§ 118.056 RENEWAL OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Every year, except in the case of temporary licenses, each licensee
shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the City ABC
Administrator no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the
license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except
where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises
licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act
of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the
premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private
organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
exiting lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less than twenty (20) days from the expiration date of the
license, setting forth these facts, and the City ABC Administrator is hereby
authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a
reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the City ABC
Administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from
the expiration date of the former license or licenses. Said license fee shall
not be payable until application is made for the transfer of said license to a
new location.
   (B)   The renewal by the City ABC Administrator of the license shall not be
construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to
such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the licensee.
(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)
§ 118.057 LOST OR DESTROYED LICENSE.
   When a license shall be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of the
licensee or his agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the original license
shall be issued by the City ABC Administrator after the Administrator shall
have been satisfied as to the facts; provided, however, that the applicant for
said duplicate license shall pay a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for the
duplicate license.
(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)
§ 118.058 REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.
   (A)   Any license may be revoked or suspended by the City ABC Administrator
if the licensee shall have violated any of the provisions of KRS Chapters
241,242, 243 or 244, or any rule or regulation of the ABC Board or of the
Department of Revenue relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale and
transportation or taxation of alcoholic beverages or if such licensee shall
have violated or shall violate any act of Congress or any rule or regulation of
any federal board, agency or commission, or this chapter now, heretofore, or
hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale and
transportation or taxation of intoxicating liquors or any rules or regulations
of the city heretofore in existence or authorized by the terms of Kentucky
Revised Statutes Chapters 241, 242, 243 and 244 to be created, irrespective of
whether the licensee knew of or permitted the violation or whether the
violation was committed in disobedience of his instructions, or any such
license may be revoked or suspended for any cause which the City ABC
Administrator in the exercise of his or her sound discretion deems sufficient.
   (B)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the City ABC
Administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had
been known.
   (C)   In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be revoked
or suspended for the following causes:
      (1)   Conviction of the licensee or his agent or employee for selling any
illegal beverages on the premises licensed.
      (2)   Making any false, material statements in an application for a
license.
      (3)   If within a period of two (2) consecutive years, any licensee or
any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the licensee shall have been convicted
of two (2) violations of the terms and provisions of KRS Chapter 241, 242, 243
or 244 or any act heretofore or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation
of the manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages or if within
such period, any licensee or any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the
license shall have twice been convicted of any felony or of any misdemeanor
directly or indirectly attributable to the use of alcoholic beverages, or of
one (1) such felony and one (1) such misdemeanor.
      (4)   Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee to pay an
excise tax or any part thereof, or any penalties imposed by or under the
provisions of any statutes, this chapter or acts of Congress relative to
taxation, or for a violation of any rules or regulations of the Department of
Revenue made in pursuance thereof.
      (5)   Setting up, conducting, operating or keeping, on the licensed
premises, any gambling game, device, machine or contrivance, or lottery or gift
enterprise, or handbook or facility for betting or transmitting bets on horse
races; or permitting to be set up, conducted, operated, kept, or engaged in, on
the licensed premises, any such game, device, machine, contrivance, lottery,
gift enterprise, handbook or facility.

§ 118.059 PROCEEDINGS FOR REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE; NOTICE AND
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTEST; APPEAL; EFFECT OF REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.
   (A)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any
law enforcement officer or of the City ABC Administrator, the City ABC
Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license
granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after
the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered
mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such
proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in
opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient If mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or
in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
   (B)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall be prescribed by the City Council of the City of
Murray by municipal order. Such order shall be maintained on file in the office
of the City ABC Administrator and a copy furnished with any notice of proposed
revocation or suspension sent to a licensee. If the City Council shall fail to
adopt such municipal order, the procedures shall be those set out in the
Kentucky Administrative Procedure Act (KRS Chapter 13B).
   (C)   A decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or suspending a
license may be appealed as provided in KRS 243.550.
   (D)   Within three (3) days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his license to the City ABC Administrator. If the revoked or
suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of
Police at the request of the City ABC Administrator shall immediately cause one
of his officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to the
City ABC Administrator.
   (E)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee may,
with prior approval of the City ABC Administrator, dispose of and transfer his
stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
   (F)   Appeal from the decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or
suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing of an appeal
shall stay further proceedings for revocation.
   (G)   If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the City ABC
Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at once
suspend all operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the entry of a
final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on
appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under this
license.

as to licensee or location except with prior approval of the City ABC
Administrator and not then until a payment of one hundred dollars ($100.00)

§ 118.061 REFUSAL OF LICENSE; GUIDELINES FOR APPROVAL OF QUOTA LICENSES.
   (A)   The City ABC Administrator may refuse to issue or renew a license for
any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for suspension
or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for state
licenses according to KRS 243.450,243.490 and 243.500, as well as violation of
any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or the
administration thereof;
      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of license
would be authorized; or
      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
   (B)   In the case of quota licenses, before approving an application, the
City ABC Administrator is hereby directed to consider, in addition to the
factors set out in KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, and any other factors the
Administrator determines in his or her discretion to be reasonable and
pertinent to the license application, the following criteria:
      (1)   Ownership: The City of Murray places great value on business owners
who are invested in the Murray community.
      (2)   Economic impact: The City of Murray desires businesses which make
the most positive impact on the community, in number of jobs, payroll, property
investment and revenues to the city.
      (3)   Site of business: The City of Murray is interested in serving all
geographic areas of the city. Therefore, the city does not wish to cluster all
licensed ABC outlets in one area.
      (4)   Aesthetics: The City of Murray is committed to protecting the
character and beauty of our community.
      (5)   Revitalization of downtown: The City of Murray wholeheartedly
supports the revitalization of downtown and the revitalization and reuse of

their ability to financially support and sustain their viability.

approval of retail liquor sales licenses in any area of the city.
   (C)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the City ABC
Administrator may appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KR 241.200.
(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)
§ 118.062 REVIEW OF LICENSE; BOOKS, RECORDS AND REPORTS.
   (A)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter shall
provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of
any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant’s business income is earned from the sale
of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated
with the applicant’s quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide
the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee’s acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identify each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of
food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for
filing of reports notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the
premises of any licensee and examine the books, audio and visual recordings and
records to determine whether the licensee is in compliance with all parts of
this chapter. Licensee shall be required to maintain all available video/audio
recordings for a minimum of 30 days. In the event the conditions of any license
requirement are not met during any particular quarter, the City ABC
Administrator shall have discretion in determining whether revocation is
appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time
to reach compliance, If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee,
the City ABC Administrator may apply an accounting period of at least one (1)
year in determining whether or not the food sale percentage requirement has
been met.
   (B)   (1)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain upon
the licensed premises adequate books and records, including audio and video
recordings, of all transactions involved in the sale of alcoholic beverages in
the same manner required by the rules and regulations of the ABC Board.
Licensee shall be required to maintain all video/audio recordings for a minimum
of 30 days. Such books and records shall be available at all reasonable times
for inspection by the City ABC Administrator and such city employees who may
assist the City ABC Administrator in his or her review.
      (2)   For the purpose of assisting the City ABC Administrator in
enforcement of this chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC Board
under KRS 243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the City ABC
Administrator. Copies of any and all reports and correspondences to the ABC
Board required by statute shall be furnished to the City ABC Administrator.

§ 118.063 DORMANCY.
   (A)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after ninety (90) days. Such is the intent of this
section. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his business
interrupted by situations not under his control, various exceptions to the
dormancy rule have been included in this section.
   (B)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of
90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in
division (C) below are proved to the satisfaction of the City ABC
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the City
ABC Administrator.
   (C)   The provisions of division (B) of this section shall not apply to any
licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a
license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing
lease. Prior to the expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall
furnish to the City ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the
fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the
specific reasons set forth herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an
extension of the dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect
during the license period or until same is transferred to another premises,
notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted during said period;
provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid unless business is
conducted there within 12 months from the date of notice to the City ABC
Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of
his or her sound discretion.

shall not permit any alcoholic beverages to be taken off premises by patrons,
customers or guests.

be amended from time to time (to the extent not in conflict with state or
federal law, or franchisee's franchise). Nothing in this chapter shall be
deemed to waive a right, if any, that any party may have to seek judicial or
regulatory review as to the provisions herein or as to actions of the parties
under applicable federal, state, or local law currently in effect or as may
hereinafter be amended.

kind, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
defense arising, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, out of or in

performed, by such franchisee under the franchise or use of the rights-of-way,
except to the extent such acts or use arise from or are caused by the
negligence or willful misconduct of the city, its elected officials, officers,
or employees. This indemnification shall survive the expiration or termination
of any franchise or use of the rights-of-way. The city shall give franchisee
written notice of its obligation to indemnify the city within ten (10) days of
receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this section. In the event any such

arising hereunder and the city shall cooperate fully herein. If the city
determines in good faith that its interests cannot be represented by the
franchisee, the franchisee shall be excused from any obligation to indemnify
the city.

and obligations under any franchise, each franchisee and other holder of a

other person, including itself, as it deems appropriate, subject to all
applicable laws.
   (C)   Nature of rights granted by any franchise. Franchises shall not convey

Franchises shall be granted in accordance with Kentucky Constitution Sections
163 and 164. The city shall grant franchises or renewals to any eligible
franchisee for the right and privilege to construct, own, operate, repair,
replace and maintain facilities in, through and along the city's rights-of-way
for the purposes of providing communications service on a nonexclusive basis
within the city, subject, however, to the standards, terms and conditions
herein set forth within this chapter, and any special conditions as may be
provided for in the franchise. All franchisees shall be required to obtain and
maintain any necessary and lawful permit, license certification, grant,
registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate
governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the city, the FCC and the
PSC. The city may establish standard franchises setting forth the minimum
requirements for all franchisees. Renewals, cancellations, terminations or
expirations of franchises granted to cable operators shall be governed by and
comply with the provisions of section 626 of the federal cable act, 47 U.S.C. §
546, or any such successor statute, and applicable law, including judicial
review and appeals.
   (F)   Acceptance and effective date of franchise. Any franchise granted
hereunder, together with the rights, privileges and authority granted thereby,
shall take effect and be in force from and after the effective date of a
resolution granting a franchise hereunder, provided that on or before that date
franchisee shall:
      (1)   Enter into and execute such agreements and documents as required by
the city that are consistent with the terms and provisions of this chapter and
applicable law;
      (2)   File such bond or bonds as required in this chapter; and
      (3)   Advise the city in writing of franchisee's address for mail and
official notifications from the city.
   (G)   Use of rights-of-way; police powers; franchisee's use subordinate. A
franchisee shall construct and maintain its facilities in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local laws, including all permit requirements and
associated fee payments, and all other city codes and ordinances in effect as
of the date of the award of its franchise or thereafter adopted or amended, to
the extent permitted by state or federal law, subject to §
119.01(D). The grant of a franchise does not in any way affect the continuing
authority of the city through the proper exercise of its home rule or statutory
powers to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to provide for the health,
safety and welfare of the public. The city makes no express or implied
representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation
or construction of facilities on any particular segment of rights-of-way. The
burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of
construction or installation shall be entirely upon the franchisee. The use of
the rights-of-way authorized by any franchise shall in ail matters be
subordinate to the city's use and rights therein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing:
      (1)   All rights and privileges granted herein are subject to the police
powers of the city and its rights under applicable laws and regulations to
regulate the construction, operation, and maintenance of franchisee's system,
subject to §
119.01(D), including, but not limited to, the right to adopt and enforce
additional ordinances and regulations as the city shall find necessary in the
exercise of its police powers, the right to adopt and enforce applicable
zoning, building, permitting and safety ordinances and regulations, the right
to adopt and enforce regulations relating to equal employment opportunities,
and the right to adopt and enforce ordinances and regulations concerning the
rights-of-way and utility standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
will administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter and any franchises
granted pursuant thereto in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral
manner, including with respect to any governmental entity providing or seeking
to provide communications service (whether directly or pursuant to an agreement
with any person) using the rights-of-way.
      (2)   The city reserves the right to exercise its police powers. Any
conflict between the provisions of this chapter or a franchise and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers shall be resolved
in favor of the police powers.
      (3)   Franchisee shall not be excused from complying with any of the
requirements of this chapter or any subsequently adopted and lawfully binding
amendments to this chapter by any failure of the city on any one or more
occasions to seek, or insist upon, compliance with such requirements or
provisions.
   (H)   Emergencies.
      (1)   Franchisee shall assign a management level individual to coordinate
with, and assist the city in the development of emergency plans.
      (2)   If at any time, in case of fire or disaster or other emergency
situation in the city, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of
the city to cut raise, lower, or relocate any facilities, such cutting raising,
lowering, or relocating may be done, and any repairs rendered necessary thereby
shall be made by franchisee, at its sole expense. Nothing in this chapter shall
prohibit or limit any rights of a franchisee under applicable law to recover
its reasonable costs incurred pursuant to this division to cut, raise, lower,
or relocate facilities from the person(s) responsible for the fire, disaster,
or other emergency situation.
   (I)   Term. A franchise shall be for a term not to exceed ten (10) years.
   (J)   Franchise fees. During any period of time which the city opts to
forego imposing a franchise fee and to instead participate in the multichannel
video programming and service tax system set forth under KRS 136.600, et seq.,
a franchisee shall not be required to pay franchise fees. Before imposing
franchise fees, the city will provide at least sixty (60) days' prior written
notice to current franchisees. If at any time the city elects to exercise its
constitutional right to impose and collect franchise fees, franchisee's first
franchise fee payment under this chapter shall be paid to the city the later of
one hundred and twenty (120) days after such election, or thirty (30) days
after the last day of the first calendar quarter expiring after franchisee
received written notice from the city that the city has opted to exercise its
constitutional right to impose and collect franchisee fees. The percentage of
franchise fee and method of calculation imposed on any franchisee shall be
equal when compared to the percentage or method of calculation of the franchise
fee applicable to any other franchisee authorized by the city to provide the
same communications service. If the franchise fee is based on gross revenues,
the franchise fee shall not exceed five percent (5%) of gross revenues received
by franchisee for services upon which such franchise fee can be lawfully
assessed under federal law, as determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and gross revenues will not include (1) any taxes, fees
or assessments collected by the franchisee for pass-through to a government
agency, including the franchise fee or any FCC user fee; (2) bad debt; (3)
credits, refunds and deposits paid to customers; and (4) any exclusions
available under applicable state law.
   (K)   Timing of payment of franchise fees. Unless otherwise agreed to in
writing, all franchise fees shall be due and payable on a quarterly basis and
payment shall be made on or before the date which is thirty (30) calendar days
after the last day of the calendar quarter for which the payment applies (the
"due date"); provided, however, that in the event that a franchisee ceases to
provide communications service for any reason (including as a result of a sale
or transfer of the franchisee's system), such franchisee shall make a final
payment of any amounts owed to the city on or before the date which is thirty
(30) calendar days after the date on which its operations in the city cease
(which shall be deemed a "due date" for purposes of this chapter).
   (L)   Interest on late payments and under payments. If any franchise fee, or
any portion thereof, is not received by the city on or before the due date,
interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the rate of
one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, unless such other maximum rate is
established by applicable law.
   (M)   Fee statement. In the event that the city imposes a franchise fee, any
franchise fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement (a "fee statement")
showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated. If the franchise
fee is based on linear feet in the rights-of-way, within ninety (90) calendar
days following the end of any calendar year in which the city imposes a
franchise fee, each franchisee shall submit a statement, certified as true,
setting forth the amount of linear feet of rights-of-way occupied by its
facilities, provided, however, that in the event that a franchisee ceases to
provide communications service for any reason (including as a result of a
transfer), such franchisee shall provide such a statement within thirty (30)
calendar days after the date on which its operations in the city cease. In
calculating the amount of linear feet of rights-of-way occupied by its
facilities, a franchisee shall include all facilities, including antenna and
other wireless facilities, and all facilities whether installed underneath the
rights-of-way or on poles.
   (N)   No accord and satisfaction. No acceptance by the city of any franchise
fee or any other payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid
is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee or any
other payment be construed as a release of any claim of the city.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, franchisees shall not be required to maintain
any books and records related to its calculation of the franchise fee or any
other payment longer than three (3) years.
   (O)   Description of communications service. During the term of the
franchise, franchisee shall either include the material types of communications
services offered over its facilities in the rights-of-way within the city on a
publicly available website, or provide the city with a description of any
material changes to the types of communications service offered over its
facilities in the rights-of-way within the city during the prior year. Any
individual communications service or item for which the franchisee has a
separate charge shall be considered a separate communications service.
   (P)   Franchise fee not a tax; payment of taxes. The franchise fee is
compensation for the use of the rights-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a
tax of any kind. The franchise fees required herein shall be in addition to,
not in lieu of, any and all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and
impositions otherwise applicable to franchisee that are or may be imposed by
the city. A franchisee shall be fully responsible for the payment of all
applicable taxes.
   (Q)   Assignment of franchise. A franchisee shall provide the city with
written notice of any transfer or assignment of the franchise, which shall be
accompanied by a transfer/assignment fee of two thousand five hundred dollars
($2,500.00). A franchisee shall not sell, assign, sublet, dispose of or
otherwise transfer a franchise (or any of the rights or privileges granted by
such franchise), franchisee's system, or control of franchisee to another
entity other than by operation of law or to an entity controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with the franchisee, without the prior written
consent of the city. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer
in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights,
title, or interest of the franchisee in the franchise or system to secure
indebtedness. The city's consent to such a transfer shall not be withheld if
the acquiring entity would have qualified for an original franchise had it
applied and if the acquiring entity demonstrates it has the same or equivalent
insurance coverage and bonds in place as is required of the original
franchisee. Nothing in any approval by the city of any transfer pursuant to
this section shall be construed to waive, release or delegate any rights or
powers of the city to hold the original franchisee liable for any violation of
its franchise.
   (R)   Forfeiture of franchise and privilege. In case of failure on the part
of a franchisee, its successors and assigns, to comply with any of the material
provisions of this chapter or its franchise, or if the franchisee, its
successors and assigns, should do or cause to be done any material act or thing
prohibited by or in violation of this chapter or the terms of its franchise,
the franchisee, its successors and assigns, shall forfeit all rights and
privileges permitted by this chapter and its franchise, and all rights
hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, provided that said
forfeiture shall not take effect until the city shall carry out the proceedings
specified in §
119.10(B).
   (S)   Security for payment of fees.
      (1)   In the event that the city imposes a franchise fee, every
franchisee shall provide to the city an irrevocable letter of credit in the
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), or one-half of the annual
franchise fee owed, whichever is less, to secure the payment of the franchise
fee for the first two (2) years in which the franchisee is subject to a
franchise fee. If there has been no default in paying the franchise fee nor any
late payment of the franchise fee during such two (2) year period, the letter
of credit shall be released, and if there has been no default nor any late
payment of any payment due to the city by any incumbent franchisee for the past
two (2) years, no letter of credit shall be required.
      (2)   This division is inoperative during any period of time during which
the city elects to participate in the state baseline and local growth funds
under KRS 136.600, et seq., and to have franchisees taxed accordingly.
   (T)   Special rules for governmental entities. Nothing in this chapter shall
be read to require a governmental entity to comply with this chapter where the
city cannot enforce the ordinance against such entity as a matter of law. The
city is authorized to enter into agreements with other governmental agencies to
facilitate the city's use and management of the rights-of-way, and such
agreements shall be enforceable according to their respective terms and
notwithstanding any provision of this chapter.

   (A)   Encroachment permit. A franchisee shall be subject to and comply with
the additional or supplementary terms and conditions of any encroachment on
rights-of-way permit, as may be amended from time to time, subject to §
119.01(D).
   (B)   Removal of facilities. Upon expiration of a franchise, whether by
lapse of time, by agreement between the franchisee and the city , or by
forfeiture thereof, the franchisee shall remove, at its sole cost, from the
rights-of-way any and all of its facilities that are the subject of such
franchise within a reasonable time after such expiration, not to exceed ninety
(90) days, and, it shall be the duty of the franchisee immediately upon such
removal to restore the rights-of-way from which the facilities are removed to
as good condition as the same were before the removal was effected and as
required by the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may allow
facilities to be left in place when the city determines in its sole discretion
that it is not practical or desirable to require removal.
   (C)   Relocation of facilities. Whenever the city shall in its exercise of
the public interest request of the franchisee to relocate or reinstall any of
its facilities, the franchisee shall, within ten (10) days remove, relocate, or
reinstall any such facilities as may be reasonably necessary to meet the
request. The cost of such relocation, removal, or reinstallation of the
facilities shall be the exclusive obligation of the franchisee. Upon request of
any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a validly-
issued building or moving permit of the city, a franchisee shall, within ten
(10) days, temporarily raise, lower, or relocate its wires or other facilities
as may be required for the person to exercise the rights under the permit;
provided, however, that the franchisee may require such permit holder to make
payment to franchisee in advance for any expenses incurred by the franchisee to
temporarily move its facilities pursuant to such person's request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee shall not be required to
underground its aerial facilities in a particular area unless the city imposes
a similar undergrounding obligation upon all other franchisees and users of the
rights-of-way in that area. To the extent that any utility or other right-of-
way occupant is required to remove or relocate its facilities as part of the
same, or related, right-of-way alteration, route or location change affecting
franchisee, franchisee shall not be treated in a discriminatory manner relative
to such utilities. Franchisee shall receive no less advance notice and shall be
provided the same right to reimbursement for removing or relocating its
facilities as any utility receives from the city.
   (D)   Franchisee responsible for costs. A franchisee shall be responsible
for all reasonable costs incurred by the city that are directly associated with
the franchisee's erecting, installing, maintaining, operating, repairing,
replacing, removing or restoring its facilities in the rights-of-way. A
franchisee shall be responsible for its own costs incurred in removing or
relocating its facilities when required by the city due to the city
requirements relating to maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for the city
purposes.
   (E)   Insurance and bonds. During the term of any franchise, a franchisee
shall obtain and maintain at its sole expense, all insurance and bonds required
by this chapter. It is expressly understood that the city does not in any way
represent that the specified limits of liability or coverage or policy forms
are sufficient or adequate to protect the interest or liabilities of
franchisee.
      (1)   Franchisees shall file with the city a franchise bond in the amount
of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) which shall be required to be in
place for the entire term of the franchise. A franchisee seeking to construct
or install a system in the city shall file with the city a performance bond in
an amount to be determined by the city. In no event shall the amount of the
performance bond required by the city exceed the reasonable costs of repairing
the rights-of-way in the event of non-performance by the franchisee. The
performance bond shall provide for the faithful performance of construction and
installation of franchisee's system. Two (2) years after demonstration of the
completion of the construction of the system by franchisee to the city, the
city shall release the performance bond.
      (2)   The performance bond shall indemnify the city in its own right and
as trustee, from any damages or losses arising out of the failure of franchisee
to faithfully perform and satisfactorily complete construction of the system in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The failure of franchisee to comply with its obligations under this
chapter or the franchise as determined by the city shall entitle the city to
draw against either or both of franchisee's performance bonds, subject to §
119.10(B).
      (4)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the performance and
franchise bonds required hereunder are in addition to all other rights of the
city, whether reserved by this chapter or authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such performance or franchise
bonds shall affect any other rights the city may have.
      (5)   Unless otherwise released by the city, the performance or franchise
bonds required hereunder shall not expire or be materially altered without
thirty (30) days written notice and without securing and delivering to the city
a substitute, renewal and replacement bond in conformance with this chapter. In
the event the city does draw monies against the performance bond required
hereunder, within ten (10) days thereafter, franchisee shall pay such funds to
the bonding company as necessary to bring said performance and/or franchise
bonds back to the applicable principal, where it shall continue to be
maintained. The performance and franchise bonds required hereunder shall
contain the following endorsements: "It is hereby understood and agreed that
this bond may not be reduced, altered or canceled by Franchisee or Surety
without thirty (30) days written notice, by certified mail, to the City of
Murray. Such termination or cancellation shall have no effect on any liability
incurred or accrued under this bond prior to the effective date of such
termination or cancellation."
      (6)   Immediately upon the effective date of the resolution granting a
franchise under this chapter, franchisee shall file with the city the following
proof of liability insurance issued by a company(ies) authorized to do business

including completed operations, contractual liability, independent contractors
protective liability and personal injury liability protection. The minimum
acceptable limit of liability amount is three million dollars ($3,000,000.00)
per occurrence and aggregate under a combined single limit. This policy must
include the city, including its Mayor and City Council members, as additional
insureds as respects all operations of the insured franchisee. The city
reserves the right to make reasonable increases in the required amount of
insurance coverage herein at any time, subject to §
119.05(A)(2). Nothing herein is intended as a limitation on the extent of any
legal liability of the franchisee.
         (b)   Automobile liability, insuring all owned, non-owned and hired
motor vehicles. The minimum coverage liability limit is three million dollars
($3,000,000.00) combined single limit for any one accident. The limit of
liability may be subject to increase according to any applicable state or
federal transportation regulations.
         (c)   Workers' compensation (if applicable), insuring the employers'
obligations under KRS Ch. 342 at statutory limits.
      (7)   Franchisee shall maintain on file with the city a certificate of
insurance certifying the coverage required under this chapter, which
certificate shall be subject to the approval of the city as to the adequacy of
the certificate and of the insurance certified under the requirements of this
chapter. Such certificate shall be identified on its face by the name of
franchisee, and shall be submitted to the city, in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this chapter. Failure to maintain adequate insurance as
required under this chapter shall be deemed a breach of the franchise.
      (8)   The city reserves the right to make increases in the amount of
insurance coverage referred to in this section at any time, subject to §
119.05(A)(2).
      (9)   The following clause shall be added to franchisee's commercial
general liability policies: "The City of Murray, its elected and appointed
officials, employees, agents and successors are added as an ‘additional
insured' as respects operations of the Named Insured performed relative to the
contract."
   (F)   Permits. Prior to performing any construction or installation work in
the public rights-of-way, franchisee shall apply to the city for any necessary
permit, and shall include descriptive information about the specific location
of any lines, facilities, boxes, or related equipment. All terms and conditions
of the permit application shall apply and be adhered to. In the case of
emergencies, the franchisee can perform critical work and at its soonest
opportunity seek the required permit and submit any applicable fees.

within the rights of-way and provide other such information as required by the
city.

rights-of-way with the city and shall begin construction work only after
approval of the city unless work is performed under emergency operations.
      (3)   All permits issued by the city shall be conspicuously displayed at
all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by
city personnel.
   (G)   Notification. Franchisee shall notify the city, in writing, at least
fifteen (15) days prior to non-emergency construction. Such written
notification shall contain the location of the construction, the starting date
and the estimated completion date.
   (H)   Standards. Any work required or performed pursuant to this chapter
shall be done in accordance with federal, state and local law, and the National
Electric Safety Code.
      (1)   In the event that franchisee leases space on the poles or in the
conduits of an electric or other utility, franchisee shall abide by the
construction and other requirements of that utility, and the granting of a
franchise by the city shall not be construed or interpreted in any way to
alleviate franchisee's responsibilities and obligations to the pole or conduit
owner.
      (2)   Franchisee, its contractors, subcontractors and anyone directly or
indirectly employed by franchisee shall conduct such operations so as to
promote and preserve the public safety and general welfare of the citizens of

be completed with diligence and with respect to all interests and rights of the
public.

direction at all times during construction, installation or maintenance

contractors shall not be delayed by any franchisee work authorized by this
chapter.
   (K)   Special exceptions. The city may grant a special exception to the
requirements of this chapter if a franchisee, upon application, demonstrates
with written evidence that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare;
      (2)   The increased economic burden and the potential adverse impact on
franchisee's construction schedule resulting from the strict enforcement of the
requirement would actually or effectively prohibit the ability of franchisee to
provide communications service in the city; and
      (3)   The requirement unreasonably discriminates against franchisee in
favor of another comparable communications service provider.
      (4)   Any special exceptions shall be granted in a non-discriminatory
manner.
   (L)   Inspections. All construction, installation and operation of
franchisee's system in the rights-of-way are subject to inspection by the city.
   (M)   Repair of sunken pavement over excavation. In case the pavement or the
surface of the rights-of-way over any excavation should become depressed or
broken at any time within five (5) years after the excavation has been
completed and before resurfacing of the rights-of-way, natural wear of the
surface excepted, franchisee shall, upon written notice from the city,
immediately proceed to inspect the depressed or broken area over the excavation
to ascertain the cause of the failure. Franchisee shall make repairs to the
installation or backfill and have the pavement restored as specified by the

hours final notice. The cost thereof, including, but not limited to, any
inspection costs and administrative overhead incurred by the city, shall be
assessed against franchisee.

for any reason by any franchisee for a continuous period of twelve (12) months,
or in the event such system or facility has been installed in rights-of-way
without complying with requirements of this chapter, or the rights granted
hereunder have been terminated, cancelled or have expired, the franchisee shall
promptly remove from the rights-of-way all such facilities of such system,
other than any which the city may permit to be abandoned in place. In the event
of such removal, the franchisee shall promptly restore the rights-of-way from
which such facilities have been removed to a condition satisfactory to the
city. Any facilities of a franchisee to be abandoned in place, shall be
abandoned in such manner as the city may prescribe. Upon a permanent
abandonment of the facilities of a franchisee in place, the franchisee shall
submit to the city an instrument to be approved by the city, transferring to
the city the ownership of such facilities.
   (O)   During any phase of construction, installation, maintenance, or repair
of the system, the franchisee shall use materials of good and durable quality.

costs of publication that may be required with respect to its franchise or any

competent governmental authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unlawful as conflicting with applicable laws now or hereafter in effect, or is
held by a court or competent governmental authority to be modified in any way
in order to conform to the requirements of any such applicable laws, such
provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of
this chapter or the franchise, and, to the extent possible, such holding shall
not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions herein or
therein.

local law, or the breach or other failure, refusal or neglect by the franchisee
to perform its obligations under the material terms and conditions of this

         (b)   Riot, insurrection, civil disturbance, sabotage or vandalism,
tampering or interference, act of public enemy, public health emergency,
accident, fire, flood, strike, unavailability of materials or equipment, war or

same within such additional time, in such manner and upon such terms and
conditions as are just and reasonable and as the city may direct.

or neglect by the franchisee was inexcusable, then City Council, by ordinance,

§ 119.16 AESTHETIC STANDARDS.
   Unless otherwise approved by the city in order to prevent an effective
prohibition of service in accordance with federal regulations, as applicable,
no person shall locate or maintain a wireless facility, pole, tower, or support
structure, except in accordance with the following design standards:
   (A)   All wireless facilities shall be located and designed so as to
minimize visual impact on surrounding properties and from rights-of-way.
   (B)   All new or replacement poles, towers, or support structures placed in
the right-of-way shall be the same color, shape, material, and general height
as those existing poles, towers or support structures adjacent to the location
of the new or replacement pole, tower, or support structure.
   (C)   All coaxial, fiber-optic, or other cabling and wires connecting
directly to wireless facilities shall be contained inside any new or
replacement tower, pole, or support structure placed in the right-of-way to the
extent technically feasible. On existing poles, towers, or support structures,
or new wooden poles, where it is impossible or technically infeasible to place
wiring connecting directly to wireless facilities inside the pole, tower or
support structure, all coaxial, fiber optic, or other cabling and wires shall,
to the extent technically feasible, be flush mounted and covered with a metal,
plastic, or similar material matching the color of the pole, tower or support
structure.
   (D)   No tower shall be placed in the right-of-way within two hundred and
fifty (250) feet on the same street of an existing tower. Replacing an existing
tower with a tower, or a lighted pole with another lighted pole housing
wireless facilities, in the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (E)   All new towers, support structures and poles should be located on the
same side of the street as existing towers, poles, or support structures.
However, this does not preclude an applicant from locating its wireless
facilities on existing lighted poles under a decommissioning agreement in which
the applicant takes ownership of the lighted pole.
   (F)   The centerline of any new pole, support structure or tower shall be
aligned with the centerline of adjacent poles or trees, unless the new
structure's height conflicts with overhead power utility lines. Replacing an
existing pole, support structure, or tower with another pole, support
structure, or tower in the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (G)   All new poles, towers, support structures or wireless facilities
proposed to be fronting a dwelling shall be placed on property lines, unless it
would obstruct sight distance at driveways or other accesses to roadways. In
those instances where placement of a new pole, support structure, tower, or
wireless facilities on the property line would obstruct sight distance, the
pole, support structure or tower, or wireless facilities shall be placed in
such a location as to prevent the obstruction of sight distance at driveways or
other accesses to roadways. Replacing an existing pole, support structure,
tower or wireless facility with a pole, support structure, tower, or wireless
facility in the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (H)   New poles, support structures, towers or other above ground facilities
shall not be placed in front of store front windows, walkways, entrances or
exits, or in such a way that would impede deliveries. Replacing an existing
pole, support structure, tower or wireless facility with a pole, support
structure, tower or wireless facility in the same location shall not violate
this provision.
   (I)   No new poles, support structures or towers shall be placed in front of
driveways, entrances, or walkways. Replacing an existing pole, support
structure, or tower with a pole, support structure, or tower in the same
location shall not violate this provision.
   (J)   No applicant shall locate or maintain a pole, support structure,
tower, or equipment associated with a wireless facility, as to interfere with
the health of a tree.
   (K)   In areas where the undergrounding of utilities has occurred, but
lighted poles are present, the applicant shall locate its wireless facilities
on existing lighted poles or seek to decommission the lighted pole to replace
it with a lighted pole to house its wireless facilities.
   (L)   If the applicant elects to decommission an existing lighted pole in
order to install a wireless facility in its location, the applicant shall
comply with this chapter, including these aesthetic standards, and any
decommissioning agreement between the applicant and the city or its equivalent.
   (M)   In those locations where the undergrounding of all utilities has
occurred, all new facilities shall be placed underground.
   (N)   No equipment associated with any facility shall impede, obstruct, or
hinder ADA access, or pedestrian or vehicular access, or block driveways,
entrances, or walkways.
   (O)   To protect the health and safety of the public from the harms of noise
pollution, all facilities shall have a low noise profile.
   (P)   Within twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date the operator
receives notice thereof, operator shall remove ail graffiti on any of its
facilities located in the right-of-way.
   (Q)   All wireless facilities, poles, towers, and support structures shall
comply with such additional design standards as may be set forth in any written
policies or guidelines issued by the city pursuant to §
119.01(D).
   (R)   All poles, towers, support structures, and other lines and equipment
installed or erected by a franchisee under this chapter shall be located so as
to minimize any interference with the proper use of the right-of-way with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners whose property adjoins or
abuts any affected right-of-way. Subject to applicable codes, overhead drops
shall be as close as possible to other utility drops in order to concentrate
the drops in as small an area as possible to minimize visual clutter and
interference with the use of private property.
(Ord. 2022-1831, passed 9-8-22)
§ 119.17 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to establish, operate or to carry

§ 130.04 HERBAL INCENSE PRODUCTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   Declaration of findings and policy.
      (1)   The city finds that herbal incense products marketed in the United
States that provide a marijuana-like high when smoked have become increasingly
popular, particularly among teens and young adults and that these products
consist of plant material that has been laced with chemicals that have not been
approved by the FDA for human consumption.
      (2)   The city further finds that the Commonwealth of Kentucky has moved
to prohibit the sale and possession of similar products, but the changing
nature of the products has resulted in the availability of herbal incense
products that exceed the Commonwealth's definition and statutes and therefore
are not properly regulated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The city is aware
that the side effects of the unregulated herbal incense products pose a threat
to the public health and safety of the citizens of the city and it is in the
best interests of the city to regulate the sale and use of such products.

security of the city and its inhabitants by prohibiting a person from
intentionally or recklessly appearing or being nude, or causing another person
to appear or be nude, in a public place and in other places which may be
expected to be observed by the public within the city, except:
      (1)   When such person appears nude in a place provided or set apart for
nudity, as hereafter defined, provided:
         (a)   Such person is nude for the sole purpose of performing the legal
function(s) that is customarily intended to be performed within such place
provided or set apart for nudity; and
         (b)   Such person is not nude for the purpose of obtaining money or

demonstration or performance by such person wherein such nudity is expressive
conduct incidental to and necessary for the conveyance or communication of a
genuine message or public expression and is not a guise or pretense utilized to

attempted rape, rape, and assault and battery, that actual and simulated nudity
and/or sexual conduct begets and has the potential for betting undesirable and
unlawful behavior; that sexual, lewd, lascivious and salacious conduct may
result in violation of law and creates dangers to the health, safety, welfare
and morals of the public and those who engage in such conduct.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS 82.082 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council, hereby adopts the following floodplain management
ordinance as follows.
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to
flooding by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Control tilling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage, and;
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; and
      (7)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in
a Special Flood Hazard Area.
      (8) Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.04 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter it's most reasonable application.
   “A ZONE.” - Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).” A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principle structure. “ACCESSORY STRUCTURES” should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   “ACCESSORY USE.” A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   “ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).” Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   “A1-30 AND AE ZONES.” Special Flood Hazard Areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood. Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.

interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the floodplain
administrator's ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1 - A30. AR/AE. AR/AH. AR/AO. AND AR/A ZONES. Special Flood Hazard Areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   “A99 ZONE.” That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system
under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.

Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to
three feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and determinate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “B AND X ZONES (SHADED).” Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.

has a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year.
   “BASEMENT.” That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   “BUILDING.” A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for structure.
   “C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES.” Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   “COMMUNITY.” A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).” A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the
Regular Program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures for protection from flooding.
   “COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified

inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or

of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e. mudflows). See “Mudslides.”
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See “Flood-
Related Erosion.”
   “FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).” A map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).” A map on which the boundaries of the

natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   “FLOODPROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the “regulatory floodway”.

regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in §
152.56, Appeals and Variance Procedures, of this chapter, means that the
variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In
examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every
newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a
part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In
addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject
to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance
rates.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.” A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “GOVERNING BODY.” The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.” The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district.
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).”
      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish,
or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential

county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to require
approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.

engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §
152.42(B);
         (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      (2)   Construction stage. 
         (a)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the Community has adopted a regulatory Base Flood Elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
         (b)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states
as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: The
applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and
thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA
maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
(0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the
locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant
flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections
or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine
regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
         (c)   In all other zones, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential Construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation 1 foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
elevation, or;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
152.25(B)(1)(c).
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D).
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant188 materials below
an elevation one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood

         (f)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood;
      (2)   All Manufactured homes must be:
         (a)   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and
         (b)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the
level of the base flood elevation; and
         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (3)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation;
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
         (c)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, Al-
30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured

            4.   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the state motor vehicle regulations, is
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
   (E)   Flood ways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established
in §
152.08, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
152.40 through
152.46.
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.42 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.08, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade.

including basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest
adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as stated in division (B).
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.43 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and,
      (1)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available (Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data
for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.
      (2)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed
structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base
flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.44 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES;) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.08, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community.
   (B)   The engineering certification should be supported by technical data
that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. New construction or
substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or flood proofed to
elevations established in accordance with §
152.08.
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.45 STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE
LETTER ‘A.’
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated ‘A’
the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Structure must be non-habitable;
   (B)   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;
   (C)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one foot above grade,
total openings are to be one square inch per one square foot of floor area, at
least two openings required on opposite walls;
   (D)   Built of flood resistant materials below a level one foot above the
base flood elevation;
   (E)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;
   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking;
   (G)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.46 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of the base flood
elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C 1334.
         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner;
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely
affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
152.08, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer §§
152.40 through
152.46. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for
adoption.
      (3)   Notification of other agencies:
         (a)   Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division of Water, and
any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse; and

152.41(E) (floodway encroachments);
         (f)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
not diminished;
         (g)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance;
         (h)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this
chapter as specified in §
152.99.
      (5)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
152.56(C).
         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with Article 3, Section B, then the Floodplain
Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonable utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source,
in order to administer the provisions of §§
152.40 through
152.46;
         (c)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
152.41(A)(2) a floodproofing certificate;
         (d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall
be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be open
for public inspection.
      (6)   Right of entry.
         (a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the administrator has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any
condition or ordinance violation which makes such building, structure or
premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the administrator may enter such
building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or
perform any duty imposed upon the administrator by this chapter.
         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, he/she shall first
present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure, or
premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the
owner or other persons having charge or control of such request entry.
         (c)   If entry is refused, the administrator shall have recourse to
every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
         (d)   When the administrator shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or
occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building,
structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the administrator for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter.
      (7)   Stop work orders.
         (a)   Upon notice from the administrator, work on any building,
structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions of this
chapter shall immediately cease.
         (b)   Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner
of the property, or to his agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall
state the conditions under which work may be resumed.
      (8)   Revocation of permits.
         (a)   The administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued under
the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false statement or
misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or plans on which
the permit or approval was based.
         (b)   The administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by the
administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this chapter.
      (9)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the floodplain
administrator's staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties, shall
not thereby render himself or herself personally liable, and is hereby relieved
from all personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or
property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his
duties. Any suit brought against any officer, employee, or member because of
such act performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this
chapter shall be defended by the department of law until the final termination
of the proceedings.
      (10)   Expiration of Floodplain Construction Permit. A floodplain
construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced construction
within 180 calendar days from the date of its issuance by the Floodplain
Administrator.
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.56 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance
are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a
piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for
a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to
the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The City Council of Murray
shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning
Adjustment or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local Circuit Court,
as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/Variance Procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter,
and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and,
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the Board of Zoning Adjustment need not
grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever
elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Board of
Zoning Adjustment believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity
of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §
152.56(D)(1) through (11) are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not
create a public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the City Clerk and shall be recorded in a manner
so that it appears in the chain of tide of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic Structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)
§ 152.57 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION NOTICE.
   (A)   Criminal offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a misdemeanor
criminal offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this ordnance
and/or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard.
The remedy may include an order to stop work on the development. The notice
shall also state that a misdemeanor charge may be forthcoming in the event that
the requested remedies and corrective actions are not taken, which citation
will request a criminal fine and shall state the maximum fine and penalties
which could be imposed.

(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)
§ 155.06 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The Planning Commission shall impose the following general requirements and
compel all subdividers to comply with the following principles of design in the
layout of subdivisions:
   (A)   Suitability of land for subdivision.
      (1)   Land not suitable for development.
         (a)   Flood hazards. Land within the floodway shall not be platted for
residential occupancy or building sites. Other land subject to flooding may be
platted for residential occupancy or for such other uses which will not
increase the danger to health, life and property. Fill may not be used to raise
land in the floodway areas except where express permission has been granted by
the Planning Commission. In other areas subject to flood, fill may be used
providing the proposed fill does not restrict the flow of water and unduly
increase flood heights. In applying this provision land below the elevation of
the Regional Flood (Regulated) on the East Fork Clarks River shall be
considered subject to flood. The elevation of this flood shall be determined
from the chart, "Natural and Regulated High Water Profiles, East Fork Clarks
River, Vicinity of Murray, Kentucky" (Tennessee Valley Authority, October,
1968), which chart is made a part of these regulations. Areas included in the
floodway are as shown on the map. "Floodway, East Fork Clarks River, Vicinity
of Murray, Kentucky" (Tennessee Valley Authority, November, 1968).
         (b)   Other conditions. If the Planning Commission finds that land
proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to bad
drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, and other such conditions as may
increase the danger of health, life, or property, or aggravate erosion or flood
hazards; and, if from adequate investigations, conducted by all the public
agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the
public the land or a portion thereof not be platted and developed for the
purpose proposed, the Planning Commission shall not approve the land or
portions thereof for subdivision.
      (2)   Premature development. The Planning Commission may refuse to
approve what it considers to be scattered or premature subdivision of land
which would involve danger or injury to the public health, safety, welfare, or
prosperity by reason of lack of adequate water supply, schools, proper
drainage, good roads and transportation facilities, or other public services;
or which would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the
supply of such services.
   (B)   Community assets. In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for
natural features such as large trees, unusual rock formations, and water
courses; for sites which have historical significance; and for similar assets
which if preserved will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision and to
the community. The Planning Commission may prepare a list of all such features
within its area of subdivision jurisdiction which it deems worthy of
preservation.
   (C)   Large tracts or parcels. When land is subdivided into larger parcels
than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for
the opening of future streets and logical resubdivision.
   (D)   Mobile home parks. Mobile home parks must conform to:
      (1)   Statutory requirements.
      (2)   Design requirements as set forth in the zoning code.
      (3)   The procedure for plat approval for a mobile home park is the same
as subdivision, and to be according to §§
155.40 through
155.50.
   (E)   Multi-building development.
      (1)   Compliance with this regulation. Where multi-building development
occurs, the developer must establish lot lines for each principal building and
lot. The developer must establish setback lines to meet all other requirements
of this regulation and the zoning code where applicable. Preliminary and final
plats shall be presented to the Planning Commission in accordance with this
regulation.
      (2)   Variance. A variance from this chapter may be granted for multi-
building development if it is shown that the land in question can not be
subdivided or that more open space is created, a lower density can be
established, traffic problems are lessened, and a better relation between land
and building is created by not subdividing the land. However, in no case shall
the Planning Commission grant a variance which does not comply with the zoning
code, where applicable, or which destroys the character of the neighborhood.
(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)
Penalty, see § 155.99
MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 155.10 STREETS.
   The design of a subdivision shall conform to the following design standards:
   (A)   Conformity to the major street plan. The width and locations of all
streets in a proposed subdivision will conform to the Major Street Plan.
   (B)   Relation to topography. Streets shall be designed with respect to
topography to produce the most usable and properly situated lots, provide
proper drainage for storm water, and produce proper grades.
   (C)   Street extensions.
      (1)   Extension of present streets. The street layout of the proposed
subdivision shall provide for the continuation or extension of streets already
existing in areas adjacent to the area being subdivided unless the Planning
Commission deems such continuation or extension undesirable for specific
reasons of topography or design.
      (2)   Extension of proposed streets. Where, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, it is desirable to provide street access to adjoining
properties, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundaries
of such properties. Where the Planning Commission deems it necessary, such
dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turn-around having a radius
of at least 40 feet.
      (3)   Required width. The street system for the proposed subdivision
shall provide for extending existing streets at the same or greater width, but
in no case shall a street extension be of less width than the minimum width
required in these regulations for a street in its category.
   (D)   Dedication of right-of-way.
      (1)   New streets. The dedication of rights-of-way for new streets
measured from the lot line to the lot line shall be as shown on the General
Plan, or if not shown thereon, shall meet the following standards.
   Street Type   Right-of-Way (Feet)
   Arterial streets   80
   Collector streets   60
   Minor streets - through streets   50
   Minor streets - local streets
   (cul-de-sacs less than 400
   feet with only single dwell-
   ing units and loop streets
   "off collectors less than
   2,000 feet around" with only
   single family dwelling units)   50
      (2)   Maximum dedication. The Major Street Plan may indicate greater
right-of-way widths for certain arterial streets, but in no case shall the
subdivider be required to dedicate a right-of-way width of more than 80 feet
for any one street.
      (3)   Arterial streets with controlled access. All streets classified as
arterial streets by the General Plan may be considered as limited access in
accordance with KRS 177.220 through 177.310, defined herein as controlled
access. All points of access shall be as approved by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   Marginal access streets. Where the proposed subdivision abuts upon
or contains an existing or proposed arterial street or highway on which traffic
volumes and vehicular speeds warrant special safety considerations, the
Planning Commission may require that marginal access streets be provided in
order that no lots will front on such existing or proposed arterial street or
highway.
      (5)   Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs). Minor terminal or dead-end streets
or courts which are designed so as to have one end permanently closed shall not
be longer than 500 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-
around having a radius at the outside of the right-of-way of at least 50 feet.
      (6)   Alleys. Alleys shall be provided to give access to the rear of all
lots used for business and industrial purposes. Alleys shall not be provided in
residential blocks except in cases where the subdivider produces evidence of
the need for alleys which is satisfactory to the Planning Commission.
      (7)   Existing streets.
         (a)   Subdivision on both sides of street. Where the subdivision is on
both sides of an existing street, sufficient right-of-way shall be dedicated to
give the street the required right-of-way.
         (b)   Subdivision on one side of street. Where the subdivision is to
take place on only one side of a street, one-half of the right-of-way needed to
give the street the required right-of-way shall be dedicated.
      (8)   Increased right-of-way necessary. If the Planning Commission deems
it necessary, street rights-of-way through commercial zones or present on
proposed business areas shall be increased ten feet on each side for needed
parking.
      (9)   Extraordinary physical conditions. If the Planning Commission deems
it necessary where extraordinary physical conditions exist, the Planning
Commission may alter the right-of-way requirements.
      (10)   Streets along property lines. Where a proposed street runs along a
property line of the proposed subdivision, the street right-of-way, pavement,
and other requirements must be met in full.
      (11)   Conflicting traffic or land use. When a proposed subdivision
contains or is adjacent to existing or proposed railroad rights-of-way,
arterial street right-of-way, other significant rights-of-way, or conflicting
and detrimental land uses; the Planning Commission may require marginal access
streets, reverse frontage lots, lots with rear service alleys, lots with
additional depth, or other measures which may be necessary for protection of
abutting properties and the maintenance or function of major traffic arteries.
   (E)   Private streets and reserve strips.
      (1)   There shall be no private streets platted within a subdivision.
      (2)   There shall be no reserve strips in a subdivision except where
their control is definitely vested in the city or county under conditions
approved by the Planning Commission as authorized in these regulations.
   (F)   Street intersections.
      (1)   Number of approaches. Intersections involving more than four basic
street approaches shall be prohibited. Merging lanes and deceleration lanes are
considered as parts of one street approach.
      (2)   Angle at intersection. For a tangent distance of at least 100 feet,
measured from the intersection of right-of-way lines, all streets should
intersect at an angle of 90 degrees. In no case shall the angle of intersection
be less than 75 degrees.
      (3)   Radii at intersection. Street curb and edge intersections shall be
rounded by radii of at least 20 feet.
      (4)   Street jogs. Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 150
feet shall not be made.
   (G)   Horizontal curves.
      (1)   Reverse curves. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
      (2)   Curve radius. Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten
degrees in the alignment of a street, a curve with a radius adequate to insure
safe sight distance shall be made. The minimum radii of curves shall be:
 
Street Type Minimum Curve Radius (Feet)
Arterial    300
Collector   300
Minor       100
   (H)   Vertical curves.
      (1)   All changes in grade for streets shall be connected by a vertical
curve of a minimum length necessary to provide adequate sight distance and
other safety factors.
      (2)   To calculate the minimum length for the curve connecting changes in
grade:
         (a)   Calculate the algebraic difference in grades.
         (b)   Multiply by the appropriate value.
Values for   Arterial and collector   50
crest curve   streets
   Minor streets   28
Values for   Arterial and collector   50
sag curve   streets
   Minor streets   35
   (I)   Street grades.
      (1)   Maximum grades. Street grades shall conform to the following:
         Percent Grade
      Allowable   Desirable
    Street Type   Maximum   Maximum
   Arterial   5   4
   Collector   7   5
   Minor   12   8
      (2)   Grades for drainage. All streets shall be designed so as to provide
for the discharge of surface water from the pavement and from the right-of-way
by grading and drainage. For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall
not be less than one-half of one percent.
      (3)   Excessive grades at intersections. When a street grade at the
approach to an intersection exceeds three percent, a leveling area shall be
provided with grades of not greater than three percent for a distance of 50
feet from the intersection of street center- lines. Vertical curves shall then
be used to connect the intersecting grades.
   (J)   Street elevations.
      (1)   Streets shall be flood free. The Planning Commission shall not
approve streets which will be subject to inundation or flooding. All streets
must be located at elevations which will make them flood free in order that
portions of the subdivision will not be isolated by floods. Where flood
conditions exist, the Planning Commission shall require profiles and elevations
of streets in order to determine the advisability of permitting the proposed
subdivision activity.
      (2)   Fills. Fill may be used in areas subject to flooding in order to
provide flood-free streets if such fill does not unduly increase flood heights.
Drainage openings shall be designed as not to restrict the flow of water and
thereby unduly increase flood heights. Such fills and openings shall be
approved by the City Engineer.
   (K)   Access to lots.
      (1)   Lots on or near arterial streets. Access to lots abutting only on
arterial rights-of-way shall conform to §
155.10 (D) (3) but in no case shall the access be closer than 125 feet from an
intersection. A lot which abuts a street which intersects an arterial shall
have access only to the nonarterial street at a distance of not less than 75
feet from the intersection.
      (2)   Lot on or near collector streets. A lot which abuts only on a
collector shall have access to the lot at a distance not less than 75 feet from
an intersection. A lot which abuts a minor street which connects with a
collector shall have access to only the minor street at a distance not greater
than 50 feet from the collector.
      (3)   Minor streets. Lots which abut only on minor streets shall have
access at a distance not greater than 50 feet from an intersection. Lots that
abut on a cul-de-sac shall have access only to a cul-de-sac.
      (4)   Marginal access streets. Lots abutting on marginal access streets
shall have access at a distance no greater than 75 feet from an intersection.
If a lot abuts both an arterial street or collector and a marginal access
street, access shall be given only along the marginal access street.
      (5)   Alleys. All nonresidential lots may have access to an alley, except
that an alley cannot be used as the primary access point to a commercial or
industrial use or other uses which generate a large volume of traffic.
      (1)   Street names.
      (1)   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with other
already existing and named streets shall bear the names of such existing
streets.
      (2)   The name of a proposed street which is not in alignment with an
existing street shall not duplicate the name of any existing street,
irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place,
court, lane, road, pike, highway, parkway, or similar suffix.
(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)
Penalty, see § 155.99
§ 155.11 BLOCKS.
   The design of a subdivision shall conform to the following design standards:
   (A)   Length. Block lengths shall not exceed 1200 feet or less than 500
feet, except as the Planning Commission considers necessary to secure efficient
use of land or desired features of street layout.
   (B)   Midblock walks. Blocks over 753 feet in length may be required to have
a midblock walk near the center of the block connecting the streets on either
side of the long block. The right-of-way for such walks shall not be less than
five feet in width.
   (C)   Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth. However, where this would require lots to front on an arterial
street or highway or where topographical conditions or the size of the property
prevent two tiers of lots, the Planning Commission may approve a single tier of
lots of minimum depth.
(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)
Penalty, see § 155.99
§ 155.12 LOTS.
   The design of a subdivision shall conform to the following design standards:
   (A)   Relationship to streets. All lots shall front on a public street or
road for a minimum distance of 75 feet except those lots which front on the
turn-arounds of permanent dead-end streets or on curves, shall front on such
turn-arounds or curves for a minimum distance of 40 feet.
   (B)   Development of hazardous areas. When lots are located on land which is
subject to flooding, subsidence, or other hazards injurious to the health and
safety of potential users; and when such hazards cannot be eliminated or
adequate safeguards provided to protect the health and safety of potential
users, the Planning Commission may declare such lots to be unsuitable for
development and disapprove such plans to develop or subdivide such lots.
   (C)   Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street
centerlines and radial to curved street centerlines. Rear lot lines should
consist of straight lines with a minimum number of deflections.
   (D)   Dimensions. The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be such as
the Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use
contemplated. Lot dimensions shall comply to the zoning code.
      (1)   Lots served by sewer. In areas where no zoning code is in effect,
residential lots served by public sewer shall be at least 75 feet wide at the
building setback line and 7,500 square feet in area.

§ 155.33 STORM WATER CONVEYANCE FACILITIES AND WATER QUALITY DESIGN CRITERIA.
   The following criteria shall control when designing storm water conveyance
facilities and water quality control structures:
   (A)   Open channels and roadside ditches. The design storm for the design of
open channels and roadside ditches shall be a storm with a recurrence frequency
of ten year/ 24-hour duration. The time of concen-tration for open channel and
roadside ditch design should be assumed to be 15 minutes.
   (B)   Storm sewers and inlets. The design storm for the design of storm
sewers and inlets shall be the 25-year storm/24- hour duration (TR-55 Method
and Rational Method). The duration of the peak rainfall event shall be assumed
to be equal to the calculated time of concentration. Storm sewers and inlets
shall be checked under 25-year storm/24-hour duration (TR-55 Method and
Rational Method) loading conditions for ponding limits. The ponding limit for
streets with curb and gutter shall be an eight-foot spread measured from gutter
to driving lane. Spread calculations shall be based upon an intensity of four
inches per hour. Pipes should be sized based upon the actual time of
concentration. The minimum time of concentration should be assumed to be eight
minutes.
   (C)   Entrance pipes and cross drains. The design storm for the design of
entrance pipes and cross drains shall be the 25-year storm/24-hour duration
(TR-55 Method and Rational Method). The duration of the peak rainfall event
shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of concentration. The
minimum time of concentration shall be assumed to be eight minutes. Entrance
pipes and cross drains shall be checked for overtopping of roadways and flood
damage to affected areas. Situations requiring pipes larger than 36 inches
shall be designed using the culvert criteria in division (D) of this section,
below.
   (D)   Culverts and cross drains. The design storm for the calculation of
runoff for culvert design shall be the 25-year storm. The duration of the peak
rainfall event shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of
concentration. The recommended check storm is the 100-year storm. The maximum
headwater under 100-year storm conditions should not be allowed to overtop
roads or increase the flooding potential in the affected areas.
   (E)   Erosion control. Plans for storm water conveyance systems shall
include appropriately designed temporary and perman-ent erosion-control
measures both for the open channel conduits and all disturbed land draining to
both open and closed conduits within the system. (Best Management Prac-tices
for Construction Activities prepared by the Kentucky Natural Resources and
Environmental Protection Cabinet and §
155.36 of this sub-chapter should be used as design guides for erosion and
sediment control).
     (F)   Water quality control structures. The design rainfall event for the
design of all stormwater quality control structures shall be the surface depth
of runoff produced from an 80th percentile precipitation event. Stormwater
quality control structures shall be designed, built and maintained to treat
filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen, evapo-transpire, harvest and reuse
stormwater runoff, or otherwise manage the stormwater runoff quality for the
80th percentile precipitation event. Green infrastructure devices may be used
as water quality control structures if they meet the design criteria.
   (G)   Design certification. Design of all storm water conveyance and water
quality facilities shall be prepared and stamped by a licensed professional
engineer (Kentucky registration required). Design methods shall be in accor-
dance with the Kentucky Department of Highways Manual of Instructions for
Drainage Design, latest edition.

that there will be no generation of automobile parking on any street.
         (b)   Off-street parking space shall be provided with vehicular access

         (c)   All off-street parking space access points on a public street
shall be subject to the following regulations:
            1.   There shall be only one (1) access point, not to exceed fifty
(50) feet in width, or, two (2) access points, not to exceed thirty (30) feet
in width each measured at the right-of-way line for commercial purposes,
permitted on the public street on which the off-street parking space is

(26) feet in width; or two (2) access points, not to exceed twenty-four (24)
feet in width each measured at the right-of-way line for residential purposes,
permitted on the public street on which the off-street parking space is
located. The Board of Zoning Adjustments may, however, permit additional access
points when such access points are justified and necessary and provided that
the additional access points will not substantially increase traffic hazards or
congestion. The zoning official shall apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustments
for a decision when permits are requested in such cases.
            2.   All off-street parking space access points on a public street
shall be located at least ten (10) feet measured at the right-of-way line from
the end of the radius point of intersecting streets (typical radius 25 feet)
but shall not, however, be permitted to be located on the adjacent or
intersecting street right-of-way. The zoning official shall apply to the Board
of Zoning Adjustments for an original interpretation whenever there is doubt
concerning the radius points of intersecting streets or in cases where this
provision cannot be applied literally.
            3.   All off-street parking space access points on a public street
shall be located at least ten (10) feet apart (measured at the right-of-way
line).
            4.   All off-street parking space points on a state or federal road
or highway shall be approved by the Kentucky Department of Highways. In such
cases the applicant for a building permit shall provide the Zoning Official
with written approval from the State Department of Highways prior to the
issuance of a building permit.
         (d)   Off-street parking space shall be provided on the premises at
the ratio of one hundred and eighty (180) square feet per parking space

      (3)   Interpretation of automobile off-street parking space required. The
Board of Adjustments shall interpret the amount of off-street parking space
required for any building or use, assisted by the off-street parking standards.
In either case the zoning official shall apply to the Board of Zoning
Adjustments for an original interpretation.
      (4)   Exception to automobile off-street parking space required on the
premises. If approved by the Board of Adjustments, off-street parking space
required for any building or use may be located off the premises but within
walking distance of 400 feet from the premises it serves or may be consolidated
into a large parking area serving other buildings and uses. The zoning official
shall apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustments for a decision when building
permits are requested in such cases. The Board of Zoning Adjustments shall not
authorize the total amount of parking space required for all buildings and uses
to be diminished except in cases where a consolidated parking area serves
buildings or uses which do not generate automobile parking at the same time
such as churches and stores. Total parking spaces in such cases may be
diminished only to the maximum required by those buildings and uses which do
generate the parking of automobiles at the same time. The Board of Zoning
Adjustments may require a plat, deed, and any other proof necessary to show
that required parking space, if located off the premises it serves, is
controlled by and available to the applicant for a building permit. Such off-
street parking space shall be maintained, required, and regulated as if it were
actually located on premises of the permitted use it is designed to serve.
      (5)   Exception to automobile off-street parking space required in the B-
3 Central Business District. The requirement for automobile off-street parking
space within the B-3 Business District may be waived provided the following
determinations are made.
         (a)   Construction of the required automobile off-street parking space
on the premises would prevent the continuous development of a compact and
coordinated row of commercial buildings fronting on an already established
commercial block or shopping area.
         (b)   The required automobile off-street parking space cannot be
reasonably provided off the premises in accordance with divisions (A) (3) and
(5) hereof.
         (c)   The principal building and use proposed is not designed or
oriented to providing sales or services to persons remaining in automobiles or
similar vehicles.
         (d)   Construction of the required automobile off-street parking space
would detract from the overall shopping desira-bility of the adjoining
buildings and premises and would result in the incompat-ible mixing of
vehicles, buildings, and pedestrian shoppers.
         (e)   Off-premise parking is available within walking distance of 400
feet from the premises it serves. Such off-street parking space shall be
maintained, required, and regulated as if it were actually located on premises
of the permitted use it is designed to serve.
      (6)   Existing nonconforming automobile off-street parking space.
Existing off-street parking space provided for any building or use at the time
of adoption of this chapter shall not thereafter be reduced unless it exceeds
the requirements of this chapter. Any existing building or use not provided
with conforming off-street parking space shall be provided with off-street
parking space in conformance with this chapter at the time of any structural
alteration of the building or expansion of the use.
   (B)   Off-street loading and unloading space regulations for trucks. All
buildings and uses which generate regular trucking traffic shall be provided
with sufficient off-street loading and unloading space on the premises so that
they will generate no loading or unloading activity on their required parking
spaces or on any street. Space shall also be provided for the servicing of
buildings by refuse collection, fuel, and other service vehicles. Off-street
loading and unloading spaces and service areas shall be adequate size and so
arranged that they may be used without blockage or interference with the use of
streets, accessways, or automobile parking facilities. Loading and unloading
space and service areas should be at least 65 feet in depth, 12 feet in width,
with an overhead clearance of not less than 14 feet. All loading and unloading
space and service areas shall be provided with access to a street or alley as
well as appropriate maneuvering areas. The Board of Zoning Adjustments shall
interpret the amount of loading and unloading space required for any building
or use whenever the zoning official is unable to apply this provision literally
and applies to the Board of Zoning Adjustments for an original interpretation.
   (C)   Parking, loading and unloading zones. Minimum required parking: In
every R-1 and R-2 zone, there shall be provided off-street parking space for
each dwelling as specified in division (A) (2) (a) of this section; no such
space shall be located within any required front yard and side street side yard
unless it be in a paved area.

§ 156.015 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   Coordination with subdivision regulations. In all cases where the ownership
of land is divided for the purpose of general development of lots of any kind,
residential, commercial, industrial, the provisions of
Chapter 155 shall apply in addition to the provisions of this chapter. It is
desirable that access points to manor streets serving all zoning districts be
located no more frequently than once every 1/16 mile to 1/8 mile. Topographical
and traffic volumes shall determine the exact locations, heavy volume requiring
greater spacing. Along any major street where subdivided land and its minor
streets are not sufficiently developed to permit acceptably spaced access
points, the Planning Commission may approve the plat-ting of temporary access
points which shall be eliminated by the developer when minor streets or
marginal access streets are extended to the permanent access points.
(Ord. 794, passed 12-22-83)
§ 156.016 FRATERNITY OR SORORITY HOUSES.
   Fraternity or sorority houses, other than those permitted within the

sorority house; however, no provision shall be made for kitchen facilities in
any individual student's room or suite. This provision does not apply to
separate kitchen facilities which may be provided in the resident manager's or
supervisor's room or suite.

§ 156.041 GOVERNMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Intent. It is the intent of the Commission to establish a Government
District. The purpose of this Zone is to identify property owned by federal,
state, county, or municipal governments or by government-owned public
corporations or agencies; also, for the purpose of putting the public on notice
that the areas so zoned are outside the jurisdiction of the administrators of
this zoning code and that development thereon is at the discretion of the
government owning the property. It is further intended that this show of public
concern may temper the proposals for development in this district and serve to
encourage government conformity to the standard of this District.
   (B)   Extent. By definition, this zoning classification applies to all
property owned by governments and government-owned public corporations or
agencies; therefore, this zoning classification shall automatically become the
zoning classification of any property acquired by such government or
government-owned public corporation or agency, concurrently with such
acquisition.
   (C)   Reversion to previous classification. Upon sale or other final release
of property by a government or government-owned public corporation or agency,
to an individual, partnership, private corporation, or other non-public
organization or association, such property shall revert to the zoning
classification or classifications which applied prior to public ownership, if
in fact it was ever under such other classification or classifications
subsequent to the adoption of this zoning code. This provision applies to
property acquired by such public bodies after the adoption of this zoning code
and subsequently resold.
   (D)   Reversion to adjoining classification. Upon sale or other final
release of property by a government or government-owned public corporation or
agency, to an individual, partnership, private corporation, or other non-public
organization or association, such property shall revert to the most restrictive
of the adjoining or nearest zoning classification, if such property being sold
was in fact publicly owned at the time of the adoption of this zoning code and
has not been privately owned at any time subsequent to such adoption and prior
to such sale.
   (E)   Rights of government not conveyable. The rights of government which
prevent it from being subject to the provisions of this zoning code are not
conveyable to an individual, partnership, private corporation, or other non-
public organization or association, and upon sale or other final release of
public property to an individual or other non-public body, any construction or
development or use of that property which does not conform to the permitted
construction, uses and regulations in force for the zoning district to which
such property reverts, becomes a non-conforming use subject to the restrictions
of this zoning code.
   (F)   Rights of government extend to lessee. The rights of government which
prevent it from being subject to the provisions of this zoning code permit it
to develop its property at its own discretion, subject to statutes and
regulations based on health and safety, and development of publicly-owned
property in this zoning district by leases, whether public or private, shall be
subject only to the discretion of the government or government-owned public
corporation or agency owning the property and such statutes and regulations as
are based on health and safety.
   (G)   (1)   Adult-oriented businesses prohibited.

      (1)   The purpose of the Historic District is to provide a mechanism for
the preservation of sites, structures, and districts of historical or
architectural significance together with their appurtenances and environmental
settings. The Historic District is meant to enhance, not substitute for the
underlying zoning classification. This article imposes additional requirements
during the construction, alteration, reconstruction, moving and demolition of
sites and structures located within the Historic District. The Historic
District is intended to work in conjunction with the other zones and for the
purpose of protecting and preserving the exterior of the buildings, structures,
appurtenances, and places.

designated areas within the City of Murray, while enhancing the visual quality
of the environment and the quality of life.

official zoning map will be amended.
      (2)   The Historic District classification and regulations shall be
established in addition to the existing zoning classification and regulations.

the underlying zone, it is intended that the more stringent shall apply. The
regulations apply to all proposed development within the boundaries of the
Historic District, as shown on the official zoning map.
      (3)   It is the intent of this section that the Architectural Review
Board be lenient in its judgment of plans for new construction or for
alteration, repair, or demolition of structures determined to be non-
contributing, except where such construction, alteration, repair, or demolition
would seriously impair the historic or architectural value of surrounding
structure or the surrounding area. It is not the intent of this subchapter to
limit new construction, alteration, or repair to any one period of
architectural style.
   (C)   Creation and boundaries.
      (1)   The boundaries of the district shall be illustrated in Exhibit A,
attached to Ord. 2009-1480, on file in the City Clerk’s office.

any development activity within the Historic District without obtaining a
Certificate of Appropriateness certifying compliance with the Historic Design
Guidelines, (refer to the City of Murray Historic Design Guidelines).
      (2)   The Historic Design Guidelines are not intended to discourage
development or to dictate architectural design or style, but to encourage such
development that contributes to the overall urban design quality of the
district. These guidelines shall be the basis for evaluating applications for
development proposals.
   (E)   Administration.
      (1)   Responsibility for administering and implementing the Historic
Design Guidelines is delegated to the Architectural Review Board, City Planning
Staff and Murray Main Street, a nonprofit corporation pursuant to KRS Chapter
58.
      (2)   Each proposed development within the Historic District shall apply
for a Certificate of Appropriateness. The application guidelines will be
followed as described in the Architectural Review Board ordinance, §§
32.65 through

SPECIAL REGULATIONS
§ 156.050 SIGNS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Intent. It is the intent of this section to regulate signs. A
permit for the installation of any sign is required unless otherwise provided
for in this section. Permits must be obtained from the Zoning Official before
installation of any type of sign. Failure to obtain a permit can result in the
Zoning Official having the sign removed at the owner’s expense. If the owner
fails to pay for such removal, the city may attach a lien to the lot on which
the sign is located.
      (2)   Purpose. Signs perform an important function in identifying and
promoting properties, businesses, services, residences, events, and other
matters of interest to the public. This section regulates all signs within the
city to ensure that they are appropriate for their respective uses, in keeping
with the appearance of the affected property and surrounding environment, and
protective of the public health, safety, and general welfare. The sign
regulations of this section are intended to balance the following differing,
and at times, competing goals:
         (a)   To support the desired character of the city, as expressed in
adopted plans, policies, and regulations;
         (b)   To promote an attractive visual environment;
         (c)   To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of
communication for businesses, organizations, and individuals;
         (d)   To provide a means of way-finding for visitors and residents;
         (e)   To provide for reasonable business identification, advertising,
and communication;
         (f)   To prohibit signs of such excessive size and number that they
obscure one another to the detriment of the economic and social well-being of
the city and its residents, property owners, and visitors;
         (g)   To protect the safety and welfare of the public by minimizing
hazards for motorized and non-motorized traffic;
         (h)   To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby
public and private property;
         (i)   To provide broadly for the expression of individual opinions
through the use of signs on private property; and
         (j)   To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free
expression is protected.
      (3)   Scope and applicability. All signs within the city are subject to
the regulations of this section and all other applicable provisions of this
chapter.
      (4)   Content neutrality. Any sign permitted under this code shall allow
the communication of information for commercial and non-commercial purposes
without regulating the content, as long as the sign complies with all size,
height, and location, as well as other applicable requirements of this code,
and does not bear or contain statements, words, or pictures of obscene or
pornographic subjects.
      (5)   General rules for reading and applying the language of this
section. Regulations are no more strict than stated. It will be up to the
Zoning Official and/or designee to comprehend the code and apply it. The action
of the Code Enforcement Officer is final unless appealed as provided in
division (L)(2).
      (6)   Hierarchy of regulations. Where there is a conflict between a land
use regulation and a structural regulation, or other conflicts not otherwise
addressed by this chapter, the most restrictive applies.
      (7)   Severability. If any word, sentence, section, chapter, or any other
provision or portion of this code or rules adopted hereunder is invalidated by
any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining words, sentences, sections,
chapters, provisions, or portions will not be affected and will continue in
full force and effect.
   (B)   Permit requirements, procedures, and fees.
      (1)   Permit required. Unless a particular sign is exempt from the permit
requirement under an explicit provision of this section or other applicable
law, then a permit for such sign is required.
      (2)   Replacements. If any sign is removed and any new sign is erected in
its place, a permit shall be obtained the same as if a new sign were erected at
a new location, subject to all requirements enumerated herein.
      (3)   Maintenance. If any sign is removed for maintenance and replaced on
the same supports, a new permit will not be deemed necessary if the size or
type of sign is not changed.
      (4)   Relocation of signs. If any sign is removed from one location and
erected at a new location, a new permit shall be obtained.
      (5)   Alteration. Alteration or enlargement of any sign shall require a
permit the same as for a new sign.
      (6)   Application. No permit shall be granted until and after an
application has been filed with the designated Zoning Official, showing the
plans and specifications, including dimensions, materials, and details of
construction of the proposed structure and meeting all provisions of this
section.
      (7)   Application form. The Zoning Official shall prepare and provide a
form to be used as an application for a sign permit. The same form may
constitute a permit, when duly approved. Multiple signs may be listed on a
single permit only when they are all on the same lot or parcel.
      (8)   Information on application. The sign application form may call for
disclosure of any of the following information, but not limited to:
         (a)   Name and contact information for the applicant, and if separate,
the name, address, and consent of the property owner;
         (b)   Street address;
         (c)   A site plan and/or building elevations showing the location of
the proposed sign(s) on the lot and/or building, including setbacks; and
         (d)   Detailed sign information including type of construction, method
of illumination, dimensions, copy, method of mounting and/or erecting, and
other similar information. The content of the message or speech displayed on
the sign shall not be considered when approving or denying a sign permit;
however, the content must be submitted to evaluate the sign copy area. See
division (A)(4) for more information.
      (9)   Incompleteness. Initial review of an application will be for the
purpose of determining if the application is complete. If the application is
found incomplete, written notice thereof will be given within seven (7)
business days of submission, detailing the points of incompleteness, provided
contact information has been provided. Notice is deemed effective when mailed,
emailed, or personally delivered. After notice of incompleteness, the applicant
shall have ten (10) business days in which to resubmit the application, with
all noticed items of incompleteness corrected. Upon timely re-submission, a new
application fee is not required.
      (10)   Time for decision. The Zoning Official shall render a decision on
each complete sign permit application within ten (10) business days of when the
application was complete.
      (11)   Noncompliance with permit. All signs must conform to the
requirements of that permit and all other applicable laws. Any sign not erected
or constructed as represented on the application upon which the permit was
issued shall not be construed as a hardship case, but shall be construed as a
misrepresentation of facts on the application and a violation of this section.
The owner or agent shall be given a two (2) week notice to remove the sign or
correct the error. Any noncomplying sign which is not removed or corrected
within the required time shall be deemed a public nuisance and a violation of
the zoning regulations, and may be abated in the same manner as any public
nuisance or zoning regulation violation.
      (12)   Fees. Upon enactment of this section, future changes of fee
schedules will be reviewed and set by the City Financial Committee and City
Council. The current fee schedule is as follows:
         (a)   Freestanding or monument style sign: $50;
         (b)   Wall signage: $50;
         (c)   Temporary signage as described in division (D)(6): $10; and
         (d)   Changeable copy sign in addition and incorporated into a
freestanding or monument style sign: $50.

residential districts.

§ 156.051 MANUFACTURED/MOBILE HOME REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of this section of the zoning code is to provide
for the use of mobile homes and mobile home parks within the city. It is
intended to provide a blend between dwellings and mobile homes such that
neither will create a nuisance to the other. Because of their unusual
characteristics, mobile homes pose special problems in the application of land
use control techniques and require special consideration as to their proper
location and character in relation to adjacent uses and to the development of
the community, and use to the circumstances and conditions under which each use
may be permitted. The standards contained in this provision represent an
attempt to provide adequate protection for, and consideration of, consideration
of, both the community and the mobile home dweller.
   (B)   The following regulations are provided for the purposes outlined
above.
      1.   Mobile home parks. Mobile home parks may be permitted only in those

provisions of KRS 219.310 to 219.410 and shall conform with all applicable
provisions of this zoning code.
Editor’s Note:
   See KRS 219.320 for current definitions concerning mobile homes. The term
“mobile home park” is not specifically     defined therein.

with the conditional use permit application. The plat shall conform with the
Department for Human Resources, Bureau for Health Services (902 KAR 15.010 -
effective date 2/5/75).
         (b)   Uses. The premises of a mobile home park shall be used for
mobile homes and those accessory buildings and uses specifically designated in
the approved conditional use permit only.
         (c)   Compatibility. The tract of land must be suitable for a mobile
home park by virtue of its location, shape, topography, and the nature of
surrounding development.
         (d)   Screening. A landscaped separation strip at least five feet in
width shall be provided along all property lines and public streets on which
the project is located. The Board of Zoning Adjustments may also require that
the mobile home park be permanently screened from adjoining and contiguous
properties by a wall, fence, evergreen ridge, and/or other approved enclosures.
Such screening, if required, shall conform to the screening section of this
chapter and be located within the required separation strip.
         (e)   Construction permit required. The zoning official shall not
issue a building permit for an approved mobile home park until the applicant
presents a valid construction permit from the State Department of Health as
required by KRS 219.350, and has agreed in writing to the conditions imposed by
the Board of Zoning Adjustments.
         (f)   Operators permit required. The zoning official shall not issue a

§ 156.052 SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of this chapter is to require buffering between
noncompatible land uses; to protect, preserve, and promote the aesthetic
appeal, character, and value of the surrounding neighborhood; to promote public
health and safety through the reduction of noise, air pollution, unsightly
areas, and artificial light glare.
   (B)   Definitions.
      (1)   "LANDSCAPING." Landscaping is considered to be the planting and
maintenance of a lawn, in addition to some combination of evergreen, shrubs,
hedges, vines, or flowers. The combination may include natural features such as
rock and stone and structural features including, but not limited to,
fountains, walls, fences, and benches.
      (2)   "FENCE". A structure consisting of rails, pickets, woven wire,
hedges, or the like.
      (3)   "OPACITY." Opacity is the concealment of office, institutional,
business, and industrial development from the view of adjacent residential or
agricultural properties.
      (4)   "SCREENING." Screening is defined as decorative fences or walls,
evergreen vegetation, or landscaped areas, which are set forth for the purpose
of concealing the view of office, institutional, business, and industrial
properties from adjacent residential or agricultural properties.
      (5)   "WALL". A structure consisting of stone, brick or the like.
   (C)   Sites affected by this chapter.
      (1)   New sites. No new site development, building structure, or
vehicular use area shall hereafter be created and used unless landscaping is
provided as required by the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Existing sites. No property lines shall be altered, nor shall any
building, structure, or vehicular use area be expanded, unless the minimum
landscaping required by the provisions of this chapter is provided for the
property to the extent of its alteration or expansions, and not the entire
property.
   (D)   Screening. For office, institutional, business, and industrial
development when established on property adjacent to any residential,
agricultural, or government zoning districts, the following shall apply.
      (1)   Screening shall be provided along all side and rear lot lines
adjacent to a residential zone to extend to within ten feet of each street
right-of-way line. However, screening may be omitted for office and
institutional uses along any lot line or portion thereof, whenever a property
is developed with a 25-foot landscaped yard adjacent to such lot line or
portion thereof. Screening along a side or rear lot line can be extended to the
street right-of-way line at a height of three feet where deemed essential for
the intent of this chapter.
      (2)   Whenever a front or side yard is across the street from any
property located in a residential zone, there shall be provided adjacent
thereto landscaped yard ten feet in depth for a distance equal to the
residential zoning lot line along the street.
      (3)   Whenever properties are developed adjacent to an alley, screening
is also required, but may also be omitted at driveways deemed essential for
ingress and egress at uses established on the property.
      (4)   Landscaped yards required by this section shall not be used for
driveways, parking, loading, outdoor storage, displays, work areas, sights, or
similar uses.
      (5)   Screening shall be provided on all new, altered or expanded
development sufficiently to hide from ground level view, all loading docks,
trash receptacles, outdoor storage, outdoor work areas, or similar uses from
any residential zoning district located within 150 feet of such uses.
      (6)   Screening shall be provided at a height and density to achieve the
opacity required. Where evergreens are used, the following shall be required:
trees shall be a minimum of five feet in height, with a minimum caliper of 1-1/
2 inches immediately after planting. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least three
feet in height when planted, and shall conform to the opacity requirements
within three years after planting. In most cases to achieve the opacity
required, this shall constitute a solid hedge or shrubbery wall six feet in
height.
      (7)   When fencing is used for screening, it shall not be less than five
feet nor more than eight feet in height. Acceptable fencing for screening
includes solid walls constructed of masonry, architectural tile, stone, wood,
or other similar materials (excluding chain link fences). The solid wall should
be reduced to three feet in height when adjacent to a public street, and shall
not be placed closer to the street than the right-of-way line. On corner lots,
the solid wall shall not be placed any closer to the street on the side yard
than the required building set back line.
      (8)   All types of screening shall be kept in a neat, clean, and
healthful condition. The owner of the property shall be responsible for this
maintenance. Where landscaping is used, this shall include property pruning,
mowing of lawns, weeding, removal of litter, fertilizing, and the replacement
of plants when necessary.
      (9)   When any type of screening is used, the property owner shall
prepare a landscape plan for submission to the planner's office. The Zoning
Official shall follow the requirements of this chapter in approving or
disapproving any landscape plan. If the property owner disagrees with the
ruling of the Zoning Official, he or she may appeal to the Board of Zoning
Adjustments for a ruling.
      (10)   All screened areas will be subject to review annually. If
deficiencies are found, the property owner will be notified by letter and the
deficiencies shall be corrected within three months.
   (E)   Fences and walls.
      (1)   Fences and walls located in any residential district shall be
subject to the following height and location restrictions unless a variance is
granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustments:
         (a)   Fences or walls shall meet the following height limitations:
   Front Yard   4 feet
   Rear and side yards   8 feet
      (2)   No fence or wall shall be located closer than ten (10) feet to any
street right-of-way.
      (3)   On corner lots, the side facing the secondary street shall be
treated as a front yard.
      (4)   Barbed wire or electric fences shall not be permitted in any
residential zone or adjacent to any residential zone.
      (5)   No fence or wall that obstructs sight along any public way shall be
erected.

§ 156.053 NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND PREMISES.
   (A)   Intent. Within the zones and districts established by this zoning
code, or amendments thereto, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and
structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this zoning
code was adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this zoning code or future amendment. It is the
intent of this zoning code to permit these nonconformities to continue until
they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent
of this zoning code that nonconformities shall not be enlarged or extended
beyond the scope and area of their operation at the time of the adoption or
amendment of this zoning code, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone or if all or part of.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots of record.
      (1)   In any zone or district in which single-family, two-family, or
multi-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family, two-family, or multi-
family dwelling as appropriately permitted in the zone and customary accessory
buildings may be erected the date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code,
or amendment notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or frontage, or both, that are generally applicable in
the zone or district, providing that dimensional requirements other than those
applying to area or frontage or both, of the lots shall conform to the
regulations for the zone or district in which such lot is located. Dimensional
variances must be obtained through action of the Board of Zoning Adjustments as
provided by this chapter.
      (2)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots
with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the date of
adoption or amendment of this zoning code, and if all or part of the lots do
not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the land involved
shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this zoning
code. No subdivision of such parcel shall be made which creates a lot with
width or area below the requirements stated in this zoning code.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses of land. Where at the date of adoption or amendment
of this zoning code lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by
the regulations imposed by this zoning code, the use may be continued so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
         (l)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the date of adoption or
amendment of this zoning code.
      (2)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the date
of adoption or amendment of this zoning code. The use may be moved to another
position on the lot or parcel through appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustments
in §
156.083.
      (3)   When a nonconforming use of land is discontinued or abandoned so as
to show a gross lack of diligence in using for one year or more (except when
governmental action prevents such use), the land shall not thereafter be used
except in conformity with the regulations of the zone or district in which it
is located.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built
under the terms of this zoning code by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements
concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
      (2)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a
structure be damaged, destroyed, or demolished by any means, it may be
reconstructed or repaired but not to exceed the number of cubic feet existing
in it, and not to extend or enlarge the scope and area of its operation prior
to its damage, destruction, or demolition except as otherwise provided in
division (E)(5) below.
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone or
district in which it is located after it is moved. However, said structure may
be moved to another part of the same lot by appeal to the Board of Zoning
Adjustments as provided in §
156.083.
   (E)   Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in
combination. If lawful use involving individual structures or of structure and
premises in combination exists at the date of adoption or amendment of this
zoning code that would not be allowed in the zone or district under the terms
of this zoning code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No existing structures devoted to a use not permitted by this
zoning code in the zone or district in which it is located shall be enlarged,
extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in
changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zone or district in
which it is located except as provided in division (5) below.
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
building which was arranged or designed for such use at the date of adoption or
amendment of this zoning code, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any
land outside such building.
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming
use by appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustments if the proposed use is in the
same or a more restrictive classification. In permitting such change, the Board
of Zoning Adjustments may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in
accord with the provisions of this zoning code.
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the zone or district, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed.
      (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is halted because of the damage, destruction, or demolition of
the structure by any means, the structure may be reconstructed or repaired but
not to exceed the number of cubic feet existing in it prior to its damage,
destruction, or demolition, and the nonconforming use resumed but not to extend
or enlarge the scope and area of its operation prior to its damage,
destruction, or demolition.
      (6)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, intentionally discontinued or abandoned so as to show a gross
lack of diligence in using for one year or more (except when government action
prevents such use), the structure, or structure and premises in combination,
shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the
zone or district in which it is located.
   (F)   Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of
structure, and on any structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be
done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of walls, fixtures,
wiring, or plumbing or other parts, provided that the cubic content of the
nonconforming structure or portion shall not be increased. Nothing in this
zoning code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening, repairing, or
restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof.
   (G)   Conditional uses not nonconforming uses. Any existing principal
permitted use at the date of the adoption or amendment of this zoning code
which would thereafter require a conditional use permit shall without further
action be deemed a conforming use, but any enlargement or replacement of such
use, in buildings or on land, shall require a conditional use permit.

§ 156.054 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Planned development projects are conditional uses in the following
zoning districts: R-2 - Single Family Residential PDP’s only; R-3 - Residential
PDP’s only: R-3A, R-4, R-5, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, professional office, industrial
- PDP’s other than for residential uses.
   (B)   Planned development projects are prohibited in the following zoning
districts: R-1, R-2, agricultural, floodway.
   (C)   Intent. It is the intent of the Planning Commission to allow some
flexibility in this chapter. This is done in recognition that times have
changed and are changing. A planned development project is unique and is not
intended for every development. However an innovative project may be allowed
through this provision. It is intended that a condominium project or an office
park or any combination of such be considered.
   (D)   Procedure. The planned development project process is designed for
projects that are complex or innovative and perhaps different from normal
development within the area. All planned development projects shall be subject
to the following regulations:
      (1)   Determination whether project subject to process. The Zoning
Official will determine if a project should follow the planned development
project process.
      (2)   Advisory meeting with Planning Commission. The developer of a
proposed planned development project shall meet with the Planning Commission
prior to the preparation or submission of a plat. The purpose of this meeting
shall be to discuss informally with the Planning Commission the minimum
requirements and design standards for planned development projects as well as
to discuss existing or proposed development which may affect or be affected by,
the proposed project. For the purpose of such discussion the developer shall
provide a sketch plan indicating the proposed project area, its relationship to
the surrounding area and the general development scheme to be presented in the
preliminary plat application. Formal application or filing of a plat with the
Planning Commission is not required for the advisory meeting.
      (3)   Board of Zoning Adjustments to determine compatibility. After the
advisory meeting with the Planning Commission the Board of Zoning Adjustments
will meet to determine if a project is compatible in its proposed location. A
planned development project application and a plat shall be filed with the
Zoning Official prior to the Board of Zoning Adjustments’ meeting. If the Board
of Zoning Adjustments finds the project to be compatible with the surrounding
area, a planned development project application and a plat shall be filed with
the zoning official. A public hearing will be held by the Planning Commission
within 60 days.
      (4)   Notice of hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be given as
follows:
         (a)   Notice of the time, place and reason for holding a public
hearing shall be given by one publication in the newspaper of general
circulation in Calloway County, Kentucky, not earlier than 21 days nor later
than seven days before the public hearing.
         (b)   Notice of the hearing shall be given at least 14 days in advance
of the hearing by first class mail to the owners of all property adjoining the
property where the project is proposed. This includes those properties across
public rights-of-ways. If the property is jointly owned all property owners
must be listed. It shall be the duty of the project applicant to furnish the
names and addresses of the owners of all adjoining properties.
         (c)   Notice of the hearing shall be posted conspicuously on the
property for 14 consecutive days immediately prior to the hearing. The sign
shall state “planned development project site” in letters three inches in
height. The time, place and date of hearing shall be in letters at least one
inch in height. The sign shall be constructed of durable material and shall
state the telephone number of the appropriate zoning commission.
      (5)   Public hearing before the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission will conduct the public hearing as follows:
         (a)   The Chairperson of the Planning Commission shall preside at the
hearing and shall be responsible for its conduct.
         (b)   The applicant or opponent may represent himself, may be
represented by counsel, or may be represented by another person or persons.
Both the applicant and the opponent may present witnesses to testify. Both the
applicant and opponent shall have the right to cross- examine any witnesses who
testify against them.
         (c)   The order of the hearing shall be as follows:
            1.   Opening statement by applicant.
            2.   Opening statement by opponent.
            3.    Presentation of evidence and testimony by applicant.
            4.    Presentation of evidence and testimony by opponent.
            5.   Rebuttal of evidence and testimony by applicant.
               6.    Rebuttal of evidence and testimony by opponent.
               7.    Closing statement by applicant.
               8.    Closing statement by opponent.
         (d)   No formal rules of evidence shall be required. The hearing
itself shall be as informal as possible consistent with an orderly
determination in a fair and impartial manner of the issues before the
Commission.
         (e)   The hearing shall be electronically recorded. If a transcript is
requested by either the applicant or opponent the expense shall be accrued to
said party requesting the transcript. If the Planning Commission gives
preliminary approval to the proposed project, the Commission must recommend to
the Board of Zoning Adjustments that the project be considered for a
conditional use permit.
      (6)   Conditional use process. An application for a conditional use
permit must be filed with the Zoning Official prior to the meeting of the Board
of Zoning Adjustments. The conditional use application process for a planned
development project will be the same as for any other conditional use once the
Planning Commission has given preliminary approval, except that a conditional
use permit for any planned development project will not be valid until the
Planning Commission has reviewed and approved the final plat of the project and
certified such on the final plat.
      (7)   Planning Commission final approval. Upon receiving written
authorization by the Board of Zoning Adjustments of its approval for a
conditional use permit, the applicant shall submit the plat of the proposed
planned development project to the Planning Commission for its review and final
approval within six months from the date of such written approval. If the
Planning Commission finds that the plat is substantially in accord with
preliminary approval and fulfills the attached special conditions, the Planning
Commission may approve the project and the Chairperson of the Planning
Commission shall indicate such approval on the final plat. The planned
development project shall thereafter be subject to all of the provisions of
this chapter regarding conditional use permits including recording, effect,
noncompliance, time limit and permanently satisfied permits.
   (E)   Dimension and area regulations. Dimension and area regulations and lot
sizes may vary from that allowed in the applicable zoning district but are
intended to be consistent and compatible with existing development. The overall
density shall be consistent with the applicable zoning district.
   (F)   Signs. Signs are allowed as provided by the Planning Commission, and
only as specified on the approved development plan.
   (G)   Other requirements.
      (1)   All PDP’s must be filed as approved by the Planning Commission and
Board of Zoning Adjustments with the Calloway County Clerk’s office and the
Murray Planning Commission. No changes will be permitted unless prior approval
is received by the Board of Zoning Adjustments and these must be consistent
with the Planning Commission’s intent and direction. All changes will also be
recorded with the Clerk and the Planning Commission and will originate with the
Zoning Official.
      (2)   The plat submitted to the Board of Zoning Adjustments and Planning
Commission shall have the following information contained and data, and shall
be drawn to an appropriate scale as to the size and nature of the project as
approved by the Planning Department.

be subject to all attached special conditions and all provisions of this
chapter regarding conditional use permits in its entirety including all
approved subdivisions regardless of their ownership.

reasonable and necessary by the Planning Commission.
   (H)   General standards. In any PDP, although it is permissible to depart
from the conformance with the principal building and single-lot dimension and
area regulations contained in this chapter, there shall be no diminution of the
regulations and standards set forth in this chapter for PDP’s.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall examine the proposed PDP with
particular attention to the following:
         (a)   The influence the proposed project may be expected to have on
existing or future development in surrounding areas and the achievement of a
desirable spatial relationship between the buildings and the land, and between
the buildings themselves.
         (b)   To insure that the roads, thoroughfares, streets, and
accompanying access points proposed are suitable and adequate to carry
anticipated traffic and that increased land use intensity will not generate
traffic in such amounts as to overload the existing or proposed street network.
         (c)   To insure that existing or proposed utility services are
adequate for the population densities or land use intensities proposed.
      (2)   Off-street parking space shall be provided on the site as
prescribed in §
156.014, General Regulations for Vehicles. All parking space and access thereto
shall be paved in a manner approved by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Areas shall be provided for the loading and unloading of delivery
trucks and other vehicles and for the servicing of buildings by refuse
collection, fuel and other service vehicles, in addition to the required
automobile parking spaces. Such areas shall be adequate in size and so arranged
that they may be used without blockage or interference with the use of
accessways or automobile parking facilities.
      (4)   No PDP shall be permitted vehicular access to a minor residential
street unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
      (5)   Lighting facilities shall be arranged in such a manner so as to
prevent direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind to adjoining street
or properties.
      (6)   All PDP building construction shall conform to all local, state and
federal regulations pertaining to the particular type of building or buildings
proposed. The Planning Commission may also require as a special condition that
any building construction in a PDP be of an approved fire resistant material or
that before the certificate of occupancy for any building within the project is
approved, the developer must provide the enforcement officer written
certificates of approval from the State Fire Marshal or State Health
Department.
      (7)   The Planning commission shall attach any reasonable special
conditions necessary to insure that there be no departure from the intent of
this zoning code.
      (8)   Because a PDP is inherently more complex than single lot
development and because each such project must be tailored to the topography
and neighboring uses, the standards and special conditions for such projects
cannot be inflexible.
      (9)   Adult-oriented businesses are prohibited as a planned development
project.

§ 156.058 CORRIDOR DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Intent. It is the intent of the City of Murray for these guidelines
to assist property owner, developers, architects, and builders by providing
design criteria that will enhance community character and quality of the entire
community and ensure the aesthetic value and visual appeal of non-residential
land uses in the following gateway corridors: from 12th Street from the
southern city limits to the northern city limits; along Highway 121 Bypass
North at the intersection of North 12th Street known as Highway 641 to the
western city limits; and Main Street from South 7th Street to Robertson Road.
      (2)   Purpose. Design performs an important function in identifying and
promoting properties, businesses, services, residences, events, and other
matters of interest to the public. This division regulates design guidelines
within certain areas of the city to ensure that they are appropriate in keeping
with the appearance of the affected property and surrounding environment, and
protective of the public health, safety, and general welfare. The design
standard regulations of this division are intended to balance the following
differing and at times competing goals:
         (a)   To support the desired character of the city, as expressed in
adopted plans, policies, and regulations;
         (b)   To promote an attractive visual environment; create attractive
corridors to Murray and improve the appearance along major roadways in town;
         (c)   To achieve high quality building and site design;
         (d)   To promote a sense of continuity and compatibility along each
corridor;
   (B)   Design guidelines on corridors.
      (1)   Applicability. The regulations of this division apply to all
development within the three corridors. It is the intent of the design
guidelines to transition from those lots or tracts located fully in the
corridor to those lots or tracts not located in the corridor by extending
building materials and landscape guidelines to those lots or tracts partially
located in the corridors. The requirements of the corridor design guidelines
shall not apply to the properties located in the Historic District, Industrial
District, franchises without alternative architectural designs, or existing
shopping centers (a minimum of three tenant spaces located in a unified
building or a group of buildings on a single lot of record).
      (2)   Compliance. When the square footage of an existing structure is
expanded by more than an accumulative total of 50%, within a five year period,
all of the existing structure shall be brought into compliance with the design
guidelines. Upon the sale of an existing structure, the established time frame
restriction, for compliance clue to expansion, will expire; however, will reset
upon future expansion. All new construction shall comply with all of the City
of Murray Design Guidelines.
   (C)   Provisions of design guidelines on corridors.
      (1)   Four-sided architecture is required unless rear or side walls are
determined not to be visible from a public street right-of-way.
      (2)   Building articulation should be used to create interest in the
building base and enhance the pedestrian experience. Material changes may be
used in some cases to distinguish the building base. No wall plane may extend
more than 40 feet without horizontal and vertical articulation. Building
façades between 40 to 100 feet in length may have either horizontal or vertical
articulation. Façade articulations/ offsets shall be shown on the elevation
drawings along with dimensions verifying that the elevations have met the above
requirements as part of the site plan submittal.
      (3)   Primary materials. All buildings shall be constructed with a
minimum 60% masonry and glass, exclusive of doors and windows. Masonry shall
consist of brick, stone, or simulated stone, including Architectural concrete
masonry units (textured, not smooth), split face, weathered face, or
sandblasted faced units. Unpainted integral color concrete masonry units are
allowed as masonry. Secondary materials.
      (4)   Secondary materials (maximum 40%) may be EIFS, stucco or dryvit,
wood, metal, or other approved material. Either wood or metal/steel or a
combination of wood or metal/steel, shall be limited to a maximum of 15% of any
building façade per material.
      (5)   Mechanical unit screening. All mechanical equipment shall be
screened from public view. Screening must match building color. Ground-mounted
mechanical units may be screened with an evergreen landscape screen. Exposed
conduit, ladders, utility boxes, and drain spouts shall be painted to match the
color of the building or an accent color.
      (6)   Trash and recycling collection areas. Trash and recycling
collection areas shall be located to minimize visibility. Trash receptacles,
recycling receptacles, and trash compactors shall be screened with an eight
foot masonry wall of a consistent color and material as the primary building if
visible from any public right-of-way or residentially zoned property.
Enclosures shall be oriented so that the service opening does not face any
public right-of-way or residentially zoned property. The opening shall
incorporate a metal or wooden gate to visually screen the dumpster or
compactor. The Sanitation Manager shall approve the location of the pad and the
dumpster. Gates shall not be allowed to swing into a drive aisle or fire lane.
   (D)   Violations and appeals.
      (1)   Violations.
         (a)   This chapter of the Zoning Code shall be enforced under the
provisions of
Chapter 40. Any person who so violates this zoning code or fails to comply with
any of its requirements, including the compliance with any official notice of
violations, shall be subject to a fine detailed in §
40.39.
         (b)   The following are examples of violations; however, this list is
not all inclusive:
            1.   To exceed secondary material limitations;
            2.   To install, create, or erect any structure requiring a permit
without such permit;
            3.   To install, create, or erect any structure in a way that is
inconsistent with any plan or permit governing such structure or the zoned lot
on which the structure is located;
            4.   To continue any such violation. Each day of a continued
violation shall be considered a separate violation when applying the penalty
portions of this Zoning Code. A separate civil fine shall be assessed for each
day a violation continues.
      (2)   Appeals.
         (a)   Appealing a Zoning Official's action or decision. Appeals to the
Board of Zoning Adjustments may be made by any person or entity claiming to be
injuriously affected or aggrieved by an official action or decision of the
Zoning Official. Such appeal shall be made within 30 days after the appellant
or his/her agent receives notice of the action appealed from, by filing with

part thereof, are in conformity with the provisions of this zoning code. It
shall be the duty of the Building Official to issue such certificate if he or
she finds that all of the provisions of this zoning code have been met, and to

interpretations and decisions specifically delegated to it by the provisions of
this chapter.

§ 156.081 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   The Board of Zoning Adjustments shall have the power to hear and
decide applications for conditional use permits to allow the proper integration
into the planning area of uses which are specifically named in this zoning code
which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone only if certain
conditions are met.
   (B)   The Board may approve, modify, or deny any application for conditional
use permit. If it approves such permit, it may attach necessary conditions such
as time limitations, requirements that one or more things be done before the
request can be initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature. Any such
conditions shall be recorded in the Board's minutes and on the conditional use
permit, along with a reference to the specific section in this zoning code
listing the conditional use under consideration. The Board shall have the power
to revoke conditional use permits, or variance for noncompliance with the
condition thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have a right of action to
compel offending structures of uses removed at the cost of the violator and may
have judgment in personam for such cost.
   (C)   The granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant
from complying with all the requirements of building, housing, and other
regulations.
   (D)   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within the time limit set by the Board, or within one year, if no specific time
limit has been set, the granting of such conditional use permit shall be
reconsidered by the Board of Zoning Adjustments. "Exercised" as set forth in
this section, shall mean that binding contracts for the construction of the
main building or other improvement have been let; or in the absence of
contracts that the main building or other improvement is under construction to
a substantial degree or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial
investment shall be under contract, in development, or completed. When
construction is not a part of the use, "exercised" shall mean that the use is
in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.
   (E)   The Zoning Official shall review all conditional use permits, except
those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once
annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where the
conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is
complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use
permit. If the landowner is not complying with all conditions listed on the
conditional use permit, the Zoning Official shall report the fact in writing to
the Chairman of the Board of Zoning Adjustments. The Board shall hold a hearing
on the report within a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one week prior to the
hearing. If the Board of Zoning Adjustments finds that the facts alleged in the
report of the Zoning Official are true and that the landowner has taken no
steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the
hearing, the Board may authorize the Zoning Official to revoke the conditional
use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the
activity on the land which the conditional use permit authorizes.
   (F)   Once the Board of Zoning Adjustments has granted a conditional use
permit and all of the conditions required are of such type that they can be
completely and permanently satisfied, the Zoning Official, upon request of the
applicant, may if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions
have been satisfied and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions have
been satisfied and the conclusion of the margin of the copy of the conditional
use permit which is on file with the County Clerk, as required in KRS 100.3681.
Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the other requirements of the
regulations, will be treated as a permitted use.

§ 156.082 DIMENSIONAL VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board of Zoning Adjustments shall have the power to hear and
decide on applications for dimensional variances where, by reason of the
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of a site on the date of
adoption or amendment of this zoning code or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions, or some other extraordinary situation or condition of
that site, the literal enforcement of the dimensional requirements (height or
width of building or size of yards, but not population density) of this zoning
code would deprive the applicant of reasonable capacity to make use of the land
in a manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone.
The Board may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions on any variance
it decides to grant.
   (B)   Before any variance is granted, the Board must find that the granting
of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare,
will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will not cause
a hazard or a nuisance to the public, and will not allow an unreasonable
circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In making these
findings, the board shall consider whether:
      (l)   The requested variance arises from special circumstances which do
not generally apply to land in the general vicinity, or in the same zone.
      (2)   The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an
unnecessary hardship on the applicant
      (3)   The circumstances are the result of actions of the applicant taken
subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is
sought.
   (C)   The Board shall deny any request for a variance arising from
circumstance s that are the result of willful violations of the zoning
regulation by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation
from which relief is sought.
   (D)   The Board shall not possess the power to grant a variance to permit a
use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by this zoning
code in the zone in question, or, to alter density requirements in the zone in
question.
   (E)   A dimensional variance applies to the property for which it is
granted, and not the individual who applied for it. A variance also runs with
the land and is transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be
transferred by the applicant to a different site.

§ 156.083 APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Adjustments may be taken by any person or
entity claiming to be injuriously affected or aggrieved by an official action
or decision of the Zoning Official. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days
after the appellant or his agent receives notice of the action appealed from,
by filing with the Officer and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds thereof, and giving notice of such appeal to any and all parties of
record. The Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken and shall
be treated as and be the respondent in such further proceedings. At any hearing
by the Board any interested person may appear and enter his appearance and all
shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The Board shall fix a reasonable
time for hearing the appeal and give public notice in accordance with KRS
Chapter 424, as well as written notice to the appellant and the Zoning Official
at least one week prior to the hearing, and shall decide it within 60 days. The
affected party may appear at the hearing in person or by attorney.

§ 156.084 PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission’s main function is the adoption and amendments of
this chapter. It has primary responsibility in guiding the overall planning
activities of the city.
   (A)   Establishment. The Planning Commission is established as provided by
KRS Chapter 100. Appointments and terms are made as provided for by state law
and local city ordinances.
   (B)   Proceedings.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall conduct monthly meetings on the third
Tuesday of each month. The meeting date and time may be changed by mutual
agreement of the Planning Commission. The establishment of this regular date
does not preclude the Planning Commission from scheduling additional public
hearings whenever such meetings are deemed necessary.
      (2)   The Chair of the Planning Commission or Planning staff shall give
seven days written or oral notice of a special meeting. The notice shall
contain the date, time, and place of the meeting, and the subject or subjects
which will be discussed. The Planning Commission shall conduct business only
when a majority of the total membership is present constituting a quorum. The
Commission may adopt bylaws for the transaction of business and shall keep
minutes and records of all proceedings, including regulations, transactions,
findings, determinations, the number of votes for and against each question,
whether any member is absent or abstains from voting, all of which shall
immediately after adoption, be filed in the City Planning office. A transcript
of the minutes of the Commission meeting shall be provided if requested by a
party, at the expense of the requesting party, and the transcript shall
constitute the record.
   (C)   Powers. The Murray Planning Commission shall have the following
general powers. The commission may employ or contract with planners or other
persons as it deems necessary to accomplish its assigned duties. The Commission
shall have the right to receive, hold, and spend funds which it may legally
receive from any and every source in and out of the Commonwealth of Kentucky,
including the United States Government, for the purpose of carrying out the
provisions of this zoning code. The Chair of the Planning Commission shall have
the power to administer oaths to witnesses prior to their testifying before the
Commission on any issue.
   (D)   Other authority. The Planning Commission, in addition to its other
responsibilities concerning adoption and amendment of this chapter, has the
authority and responsibility for reviewing all planned development projects.
This responsibility, like subdivision plat review, involves guiding the initial
disposition of land including the proper arrangement of streets in relation to
other existing or planned streets, provision of adequate open space, and the
avoidance of congestion and is consequently equivalent to the Planning
Commission’s primary responsibility for subdivision plat review and approval.
   (E)   Administrative procedure.
      (1)   The circuit court has jurisdiction to determine all questions and
issues properly brought before it on appeal from decisions of the Planning
Commission.
      (2)   Applications shall be filed with the Zoning Official for any action
to come before the Planning Commission. Applications shall be obtained from the
Zoning Official and properly filled out according to their instruction and
returned prior to their consideration. The Zoning Official shall review all
applications for their completeness. A fee as established by the City Council
will be charged for all applications.

§ 156.093 STORM WATER CONVEYANCE FACILITIES AND WATER QUALITY DESIGN CRITERIA.
   The following criteria shall control when designing storm water conveyance
facilities and water quality control structures:
   (A)   Open channels and roadside ditches. The design storm for the design of
open channels and roadside ditches shall be a storm with a recurrence frequency
of ten year/24-hour duration. The time of concentration for open channel and
roadside ditch design should be assumed to be 15 minutes.
   (B)   Storm sewers and inlets. The design storm for the design of storm
sewers and inlets shall be the 25-year storm/24-hour duration (TR-55 Method and
Rational Method). The duration of the peak rainfall event shall be assumed to
be equal to the calculated time of concentration. Storm sewers and inlets shall
be checked under 25-year storm/24-hour duration (TR-55 Method and Rational
Method) loading conditions for ponding limits. The ponding limit for streets
with curb and gutter shall be an eight-foot spread measured from gutter to
driving lane. Spread calculations shall be based upon an intensity of four
inches per hour. Pipes should be sized based upon the actual time of
concentration. The minimum time of concentration should be assumed to be eight
minutes.
   (C)   Entrance pipes and cross drains. The design storm for the design of
entrance pipes and cross drains shall be the 25-year storm/24-hour duration
(TR-55 Method and Rational Method). The duration of the peak rainfall event
shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of concentration. The
minimum time of concentration shall be assumed to be eight minutes. Entrance
pipes and cross drains shall be checked for overtopping of roadways and flood
damage to affected areas. Situations requiring pipes larger than 36 inches
shall be designed using the culvert criteria in division (D) of this section,
below.
   (D)   Culverts and cross drains. The design storm for the calculation of
runoff for culvert design shall be the 25-year storm. The duration of the peak
rainfall event shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of
concentration. The recommended check storm is the 100-year storm. The maximum
headwater under 100-year storm conditions should not be allowed to overtop
roads or increase the flooding potential in the affected areas.
   (E)   Erosion control. Plans for storm water conveyance systems shall
include appropriately designed temporary and permanent erosion-control measures
both for the open channel conduits and all disturbed land draining to both open
and closed conduits within the system. (Best Management Practices for
Construction Activities prepared by the Kentucky Natural Resources and
Environmental Protection Cabinet and § 156.36 of this subchapter should be used
as design guides for erosion and sediment control).
     (F)   Water quality control structures. The design rainfall event for the
design of all stormwater quality control structures shall be the surface depth
of runoff produced from an 80th percentile precipitation event. Stormwater
quality control structures shall be designed, built and maintained to treat
filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen, evapo-transpire, harvest and reuse
stormwater runoff, or otherwise manage the stormwater runoff quality for the
80th percentile precipitation event. Green infrastructure devices may be used
as water quality control structures if they meet the design criteria.
   (G)   Design certification. Design of all storm water conveyance and water
quality facilities shall be prepared and stamped by a licensed professional
engineer (Kentucky registration required). Design methods shall be in
accordance with the Kentucky Department of Highways Manual of Instructions for
Drainage Design, latest edition.

minimize soil erosion:
         (a)   The extent of the disturbed area and the duration of its
exposure shall be kept within reasonable limits.
         (b)   Cut and fill operations shall be kept to a minimum. Developments
calling for excessive cutting and filling may be refused a permit if it is
determined that the land use proposed for the site can be reasonable
constructed with less alteration of the natural terrain.

are specifically exempt from this article:
      (1)   Land disturbance associated with existing one and two family
dwelling.
      (2)   Use of land for home gardening.
      (3)   Agricultural use of land which is used in accordance with a farm
conservation plan approved by the local soil conservation service or which has
been determined by said service that such use will not cause excessive erosion
or sedimentation.
      (4)   Land disturbance activities covered under an approved subdivision’s
sedimentation and erosion control plan. (NOTE: Often these plans will cover
only the land disturbance associated with lot arrangement and street
development and not the individual lot development.)

subchapter or the application thereof to any person, establishment or
circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other
provisions or application of this subchapter.
   (E)   Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the storm drainage system and or receiving waters of the
Commonwealth, any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters

§ 157.10 ENFORCEMENT.

practice or who believes that he will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person

and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Mayor requires.
Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Mayor shall furnish a copy of the same to
the person or persons who allegedly committed or are about to commit the
alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within thirty (30) days after
receiving a complaint, or within thirty (30) days after the expiration of any
period of reference under subsection (C), the Mayor shall investigate the
complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends
to resolve it. If the Mayor decides to resolve the complaint, he shall proceed
to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by
informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Nothing said or
done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made public or used as
evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter without the written
consent of the persons concerned. Any employee of the Mayor who shall make
public any information in violation of this provision shall be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than $1,000
or imprisoned not more than one year.
   (B)   A complaint under subsection (A) shall be filed within one hundred and
eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred.
Complaints shall be in writing and shall state the facts upon which the
allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be
reasonably and fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to
the complaint against him and with the leave of the Mayor, which shall be
granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his answer
at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If within thirty (30) days after a complaint is filed with the Mayor,
the Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this ordinance,
the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days thereafter, file a complaint
with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The
Mayor will assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance within
thirty (30) days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30)
days thereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this ordinance, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the
complaint. If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has
occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from
engaging in such practice or order such affirmative action as may be
appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the

   (A)   In conducting an investigation the Mayor shall have access at all
reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals, and other
evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and copy such
materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as
are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation; provided
however, that the Mayor first complies with the provisions of the Fourth
Amendment of the United States Constitution relating to unreasonable searches
and seizures. The Mayor may issue subpoenas to compel his access to or the
production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue
interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same
limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or
served in aid of a civil action in the United States district court for the
district in which the investigation is taking place. The Mayor may administer
oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the Mayor, a respondent shall be entitled
to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the
Mayor to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas
issued by the Mayor himself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent
shall show on their face the name and address of such respondent and shall
state that they were issued at his request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Mayor shall be entitled to the
same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United States
district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the
request of a respondent shall be paid by him.
   (D)   Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the Mayor to revoke or modify the subpoena. The Mayor shall
grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires appearance or
attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of
evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does
not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that
compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Mayor or other
person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the
state court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was
addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.
   (F)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or other evidence,
if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the
Mayor shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year,
or both. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the Mayor, shall make
or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any report,
account, record, or other document submitted to the Mayor pursuant to his
subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to
be made full, true, and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or
other documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means
falsify any documentary evidence, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or
imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

participates as a part or as amicus pursuant to this chapter.

however, that the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this
section or sections
157.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the Mayor are likely to result in satisfactory
settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complaint or in the compliant
made to the Mayor and which practice forms the basis for the action in court
and provided however, that any sale encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to
the issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this chapter, and
involving a bona fidepurchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice
of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the
provision of this chapter shall not be affected.

or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of
