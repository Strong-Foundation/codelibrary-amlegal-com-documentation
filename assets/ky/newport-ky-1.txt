the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings, general guidelines applicable to all historic districts, or
special guidelines specific to the subject local historic district.
         (c)   After evaluating the testimony received at its public hearing,
survey information, and other material it has assembled, the Commission shall
have up to 12 months after a new designation is proposed to make its
recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission with a written report on
the local historic district under consideration. The report shall contain
information about the district and the structures and sites within the district
which have been identified for inclusion in the proposed designation.
         (d)   The Commission's recommendation shall be made to the Planning
and Zoning Commission to form the base of an application for a zoning map
amendment to a Design Review Overlay District that will have the same
boundaries as the proposed local historic district.
      (4)   Step 4 - Planning and Zoning Commission review and recommendation.
         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the Commission's
recommendation as part of a zoning map amendment process.
         (b)   The review process and resulting recommendation to the Board of
Commissions shall be in the same form, and with the same public notice, as
required by Article XVII of the Newport Zoning Ordinance.
      (5)   Step 5 - Board of Commissioners review and decision.
         (a)   The Board of Commissioners shall review the local historic
district designation and the related zoning map amendment simultaneously.
         (b)   The Board of Commissioners shall review the information
forwarded from the Historic Preservation Commission and the Planning and Zoning
Commission, and make a decision to approve, modify, or deny the proposed
designation in accordance with the provisions of Article XVII of the Newport
Zoning Ordinance.
         (c)   The Board of Commissioners shall make their decision by the
enactment of two ordinances. One ordinance shall be required for the
designation of the local historic district, and a second ordinance shall be
required for the related zoning map amendment to a Design Review Overlay
District.
      (6)   Step 6 - notification of designation. Within 30 days of the Board
of Commissioner's decision, the Commission shall notify each owner of the
decision relating to their property and shall arrange that the designation of a
property as that located within a local a historic district be recorded in the
land records of Campbell County. The Commission shall also give notice of the
decision to the government offices in the City and Campbell County, which shall
retain them for future reference.
   (D)   Nominations to the National Register of Historic Places. The
designation of any landmarks, landmark sites, or historic district to the
National Register of Historic Places shall follow the procedural requirements
of Kentucky Heritage Council.
   (E)   Amending or rescinding of designation.
      (1)   The amendment or rescission of any designation shall be
accomplished through the same steps as were followed in the original
designation.
      (2)   Passage of any ordinance to rescind a designation shall relieve the
owner or owners of any properties from any duties or penalties related to this
subchapter on historic preservation.
   (F)   Moratorium on demolition during designation process.
      (1)   A moratorium on all demolition of any structure shall be in effect
in areas proposed for designation as a landmark, landmark site, or historic
district until such time that the Board of Commissioners has approved, modified
or disapproved the proposed designation.
      (2)   During the period of any moratorium, approval for or the denial of,
any request for demolition shall be required in accordance with the COA process
and historic preservation guidelines set forth herein.

§ 32.076 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS (COA).
   (A)   Purpose. Newport's local historic districts, special design areas,
local landmarks, and local landmark sites are a visible reminder of the
history, architecture, and cultural heritage of the city, state, and nation. In
an effort to preserve the character of these areas, buildings, and sites, the
city has established reasonable development standards and design guidelines for
buildings and structures within historic districts or for landmarks and
landmark sites outside of a historic district. The purpose of the COA is to
provide a method of review for the construction, expansion, alteration,
demolition, or other modification of the buildings and structures in local
historic districts and design review overlay districts or for local landmarks
and local landmark sites outside of historic districts.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   Unless specifically exempted by this code of ordinances, no person
shall carry out any exterior alteration, addition, restoration, reconstruction,
demolition, removal of exterior architectural elements, construction that
alters the architectural style of existing structures, new construction, or
moving of a site, structure, or building that is a locally designated landmark
or landmark site, or that is within a locally designated historic district,
without an approved COA. Furthermore, no changes in appearance of such property
or structure shall be made, including, but not limited to, its light fixtures,
signs, awnings, windows, siding, roof, doors, shutters, sidewalks, latticework,
decorative trim, fences, walls, retaining walls, steps, soffits, paving, or
other exterior elements which affect the appearance and cohesiveness of the
local historic district, design review overlay district, local landmark, or
local landmark site without first obtaining an approved COA in accordance with
this section.
      (2)   Site improvements such as the establishment of a parking lot or
structure, landscaping, or other site work shall also be subject to this
section unless otherwise waived by the HPO.
      (3)   Projects and activities that are exempt from the COA process are
the following:
         (a)   Ordinary repair and maintenance of a building or structure which
does not change or alter the exterior appearance of the building or structure;
         (b)   Changes in occupancy not involving structural or exterior work;
         (c)   Interior electrical wiring, HVAC or plumbing work on an existing
structure; and
         (d)   Interior building renovations which will not alter and/or affect
the exterior elevations and facade of the building or structure or any
architectural features that are visible from the outside.
   (C)   COA review authority.
      (1)   All applications for a COA that include any of the following work
shall be subject to review by the Commission in accordance with §
32.076(G):
         (a)   Construction, expansion of floor area, moving, or demolition
(partial or complete) of all new or existing buildings and structures; or
         (b)   Any substantial change in building materials, building elements
(e.g., doors, windows, architectural ornamentation, etc.) as may be determined
by the HPO.
      (2)   All other applications for a COA shall be reviewed by the HPO in
accordance with §
32.076(F).
      (3)   The HPO shall have the authority to forward a COA application to
the Commission for review pursuant to §
32.076(G) if the HPO finds:
         (a)   That the proposed use or development could potentially create
significant impacts on an adjacent property based on the intensity or proximity
of the proposed use, construction, alteration, or other modification; or
         (b)   There is difficulty in interpreting the application of a
standard, guidelines, or other regulation as it pertains to the subject
application.
   (D)   Determining the significance of a structure and related applicability.
      (1)   When making decisions or recommendations about changes to
structures subject to the COA requirement, the HPO or Commission, as
applicable, shall have the authority to make a determination of the historical
or architectural significance of the structure based on this section.
      (2)   In cases where there is an adopted historic inventory, the HPO or
Commission, as applicable, shall utilize the information in the historic
inventory to make a determination of the significance (historic, non-historic
contributing, historic noncontributing, and noncontributing).
      (3)   Where a historic inventory has not been adopted, the HPO or
Commission, as applicable, shall determine whether a structure or site is
historic, non-historic contributing, historic, noncontributing, and non-
contributing based on the structure's or site's:
         (a)   Value as a reminder of the cultural, historical, or
archaeological heritage of the City, state, or nation;
         (b)   Location as a site of a significant local, state, or national
event;
         (c)   Identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the City, state, or nation;
         (d)   Identification as the work of a master builder, designer, or
architect whose individual work has influenced the City, state, or nation;
         (e)   Value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that it retains sufficient elements showing such architectural
significance;
         (f)   Example of an architectural style or period; and/or
         (g)   Character as a contributing element in the applicable historic
district.
      (4)   For structures that the HPO or Commission, as applicable, finds are
not historic noncontributing or non-contributing, the HPO or Commission, as
applicable, may relax or waive the standards or guidelines that apply to the
project.
      (5)   If the HPO or Commission, as applicable, finds that the structure
is historically or non-historic contributing, the standards and guidelines of
this code may be fully applied at the discretion of the HPO or Commission, as
applicable.
   (E)   Initiation.
      (1)   The Planning and Development Department shall forward every
application for a permit that would authorize an exterior alteration visible to
the public, new construction, demolition or relocation affecting a local
landmark, a local landmark site or a property in a local historic district to
the HPO. The HPO shall give the applicant a form requesting additional
information regarding the application.
      (2)   When a person wishes to undertake an exterior alteration, visible
to the public, affecting a landmark, a landmark site or a property in a
historic district which does not require a building permit, that person shall
apply directly to the HPO for a COA.
      (3)   An application for a COA may be initiated by the property owner or
other person with authority to file an application as authorized by the
property owner.
   (F)   COA review procedure by the HPO. The review procedure for a COA
subject to review by the HPO shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - application. The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with the provisions of this subchapter on the Historic Preservation
Commission.
      (2)   Step 2 - HPO review and decision.
         (a)   The HPO may distribute the application to other staff members
and other city departments to solicit comment on the proposed COA application.
         (b)   Within 30 days after the application is determined to be
complete, the HPO shall make a decision on the application. In making its
decision, the HPO may approve or deny the application. The HPO shall also have
the authority to forward the application to the Commission for review pursuant
§
32.076(G).
         (c)   Prior to finalizing approval of the application, the HPO shall
have the authority to provide comments to the applicant regarding necessary
revisions to bring the application into full compliance. The application shall
not be deemed formally approved until the applicant makes all of the
appropriate changes and submits all necessary revised forms, maps, and
documents to the HPO.
      (3)   Step 3 - zoning permit application.
         (a)   Following the formal approval of the COA application, the HPO
shall issue a COA.
         (b)   Following issuance of a COA, the applicant may immediately
submit an application for a zoning permit. The applicant may also request
simultaneous application review of the COA and zoning permit. In no case shall
there be a decision on a zoning permit where a COA is required unless an
approval of a COA has been granted prior to the final decision on the zoning
permit.
   (G)   COA review procedure by the Commission. The following procedure shall
apply to any application subject to review by the Commission or any application
the HPO determines should be reviewed by the full Commission.
      (1)   Step 1 - pre-application conference (optional).
         (a)   Prior to filing an application, an applicant may request a
meeting with the HPO or city staff for a pre-application conference to discuss
the subject application.
         (b)   An applicant may also request to meet with the Commission during
a scheduled work session to discuss the proposed application and development.
Such request shall be submitted to the HPO in writing at least 14 days in
advance of the Commission's next meeting.
         (c)   The applicant shall supply preliminary information to the HPO.
The applicant shall submit such information according to the established
deadlines of the Commission's next meeting.
         (d)   The purpose of the pre-application conference shall be to review
the draft site plan with the HPO and other staff members, as appropriate, and
to identify any initial conflicts between the application, this code, and any
applicable design guidelines.
         (e)   No action can be taken by the HPO or Commission until the
applicant submits an actual application and/or plan to the City pursuant to the
laws and policies of the City. Therefore, all discussions that occur between
the applicant and HPO and/or Commission prior to the date applicant submits an
actual application and/or plan, including, but not limited to, any informal
meetings with the HPO, are not binding on the City and do not constitute
official assurances or representations by the City or its officials regarding
any aspects of the plan or application discussed.
      (2)   Step 2 - application.
         (a)   The applicant shall submit an application in accordance with the
provisions of this subchapter on the Historic Preservation Commission.
         (b)   In making application, the HPO or Commission may request that
the applicant provide exhibits, plans, sketches, examples of materials,
renderings, or other documentation to assist in their decision.
      (3)   Step 3 - HPO review.
         (a)   Upon determination that a COA application is complete, the HPO
shall refer the application to the Commission.
         (b)   Prior to the Commission meeting for the subject application, the
HPO shall review the application and may prepare a staff report.
      (4)   Step 4 - Commission review and decision.
         (a)   The Commission shall review the application during a scheduled
public meeting within 45 days after the completed application is received by
the HPO, unless extenuating circumstances exist or upon the agreement of the
applicant and the HPO or the Commission. In reviewing the application, the
Commission shall at a minimum, consider the staff report from the HPO, if
submitted, the applicable design guidelines, and the review criteria of this
subchapter.
         (b)   Within 60 days after the completed application is received by
the HPO, the Commission shall make a decision; however, the Commission may
extend the time for decision an additional 60 days, when the application is for
demolition or new construction. In making its decision, the Commission may
approve, approve with modifications, or deny the application.
         (c)   If the Commission fails to decide on an application within the
specified time period, the application shall be deemed approved.
         (d)   If the Commission approves the COA with some modification, the
COA application shall not be deemed formally approved until the applicant makes
all of the appropriate changes and submits all necessary revised forms, maps,
plans, and documents to the HPO that will illustrate the development as
approved by the Commission including any approved changes or modifications.
         (e)   If the application is denied, the Commission shall give its
reasons for the denial using the criteria used in this subchapter.
         (f)   In making its decision, the Commission may prepare a list of
routine alterations, which shall receive immediate approval without a public
hearing when an applicant complies with the specifications of the Commission.
The list shall include suggested paint colors appropriate for different types
of buildings.
      (5)   Step 5 - zoning permit application.
         (a)   Following the formal approval of the COA application, the HPO
shall issue a COA.
         (b)   Following issuance of a COA, the applicant may immediately
submit an application for a zoning permit. The applicant may also request
simultaneous application review of the COA and zoning permit. In no case shall
there be a decision on a zoning permit where a COA is required unless an
approval of a COA has been granted prior to the final decision on the zoning
permit.
   (H)   COA review criteria.
      (1)   General Review Criteria for all COA Applications Decisions on a COA
application shall be based on consideration of the following general review
criteria:
         (a)   The proposed development is in compliance with all the
requirements of this code and other related codes and ordinances enforced by
the city;
         (b)   The proposed development is in compliance with the applicable
base zoning district and any applicable overlay districts;
         (c)   The proposed development meets all the requirements or
conditions of any applicable development approvals (e.g., conditional use
approvals, variance approvals, etc.);
         (d)   The proposed development complies with the applicable design
guidelines;
         (e)   In its considerations of whether an application is deserving of
an approval, the HPO or Commission, as applicable, may also consider the cost
of modifications or other proposals, where costs for a particular action or
inaction may be unreasonable given existing conditions of a structure, site, or
area;
         (f)   The HPO or Commission, as applicable, shall encourage
alterations and repairs to historic structures and to structures in historic
districts in the spirit of their existing architectural style; however,
additions in styles different than the existing structure may be approved if
such additions complement the existing architectural style. The HPO or
Commission, as applicable, shall be flexible in its judgment of plans for
alteration, repair, or demolition of structures, sites, and areas of little
historic or cultural value except where such alteration, repair, or demolition
would seriously impair the historic value and character of surrounding
structures or of the surrounding area. It is not the intent of this subchapter
to limit alteration or repair to any one period of architectural style;
         (g)   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall be
aware of the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the
applicant. The Commission shall also recognize the importance of approving
plans that will be reasonable for the applicant to carry out.
      (2)   Additional review criteria for the moving of historic structures.
         (a)   The Commission may authorize the moving of a historic structure
or structure in a historic district through a COA application.
         (b)   The Commission may approve a COA for the moving of a structure
within the same historic district if the move will enhance the character of the
overall district or not substantially alter the district.
         (c)   In general, the Commission shall consider the following criteria
for the moving of historic structures:
            1.   The contribution the building or structure makes to its
present setting;
            2.   Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated;
            3.   Whether the building or structure can be moved without
significant damage to its physical integrity;
            4.   The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed
site and adjacent properties; and
            5.   These considerations shall be in addition to the points
contained in §
32.076(H)(1), above.
         (d)   The Commission may approve a COA for the moving of a structure
to a property outside of the historic district provided that:
            1.   There is a determination that the structure is noncontributing
in an adopted historic inventory; or
            2.   That while the structure is historic, that the reuse of the
property where the structure was located will enhance the character and quality
of the historic district as compared to the structure that is proposed to be
moved.
      (3)   Additional requirements and review criteria for demolition.
         (a)   An application for the demolition of a building shall require a
COA and follow the procedures and requirements of §
32.076(G).
         (b)   Any application for demolition shall include a plan for the
reuse of the property that illustrates the mitigation of any adverse effects of
the proposed removal upon the property, the streetscape, or the applicable
historic district. Such plan shall demonstrate reuse through new construction,
exterior rehabilitation, or restoration. Additionally, such plan shall
demonstrate that the plan is consistent with this subchapter and any applicable
guidelines; contributes to the historic character of the district, or, in the
case of a landmark or landmark site, reflects the architectural character of
the demolished structure; complies with the applicable design guidelines; and
which contributes to the architectural or historic integrity of the applicable
historic district; and
         (c)   Where an application includes a plan for the reuse of the
property through new construction, the application shall include a schedule for
construction that will result in the completion of new construction within 24
months from the date the COA is issued. Completion dates that extend beyond 24
months may be granted at the discretion of the Commission.
         (d)   Demolition approval criteria: The Commission may approve a COA
for demolition only if one of the following is satisfied:
            1.   The applicant has given clear evidence that the structure has
incurred extensive damage to its basic structural elements such as roof, wall,
and foundation requiring substantial reconstruction, and the structure presents
an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare as declared by the
Planning and Development Director (condemnation), or their designee, but that
such damage was not done through neglect of the property by the owner or former
owners; or
            2.   The demolition is proposed for a structure that is identified
by the Commission as not contributing to the landmark site or the historic
district; or
            3.   The applicant can demonstrate an undue economic hardship
during the hearing with evidence describing the circumstances of hardship. The
minimum evidence shall include for all property:
               a.   The nature of ownership (individual, business, or
nonprofit) or legal possession, custody, and control;
               b.    Financial resources of the owner and/or parties in
interest;
               c.   Cost of repairs;
               d.    Assessed value of the land and improvements;
               e.   Real estate taxes for the previous two years;
               f.    Amount paid for the property, date of purchase, and party
from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship between the
owner and the person from whom the property was purchased, or other means of
acquisition of title, such as by gift or inheritance;
               g.    Annual debt service, if an):, for previous two years;
               h.   Any listing of the property: for sale or rent; price asked,
and offers received, if any;
               i.    Annual gross income from the property for the previous two
years, for income-producing property;
               j.    Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the
previous 2 years, including proof that adequate and competent management
procedures were followed, for income- producing property; and
               k.    Annual cash flow, if any, for the previous 2 years, for
income-producing property.
         (e)   Demolition approval considerations.
            1.   For decisions related to economic hardship, the Commission
shall cause to be made a finding of undue or no undue economic hardship and
shall enter the reasons for such finding into the record. In the event of a
finding of no undue economic hardship, the Commission shall cause to be issued
an order for such property to be repaired within the time specified.
            2.   In the event of a finding of undue economic hardship, the
finding shall be accompanied by a recommended plan to relieve the economic
hardship. This plan may include, but is not limited to, relaxation of the
provisions of the historic preservation guidelines sufficient to mitigate the
undue economic hardship. The Commission shall report such finding and plan to
the HPO. The Commission shall cause to be issued an order for such property to
be repaired within the time specified, and according to the provisions of the
recommended plan.
            3.   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark, a building or
structure on a landmark site, or a building or structure in a historic
district, the Commission shall see if an alternative to demolition can be
found. The Commission may ask interested individuals and organizations for
assistance in seeking an alternative to demolition and in obtaining estimates
on rehabilitation costs for the threatened building. Neglect to a structure
which causes deteriorations shall not be considered as a factor to permit
demolition of the structure.
            4.   On all other demolition applications, the Commission shall
study the question of economic hardship for the applicant and shall determine
whether the landmark or the property in the historic district can be put to
reasonable beneficial use, without the approval of the demolition application.
            5.   In the case of an income-producing building, the Commission
shall also determine whether the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from
their existing building.
            6.   The Commission may ask applicants for additional information
to be used in making these determinations. These determinations shall be in
addition to the points contained in other parts of this subchapter. If economic
hardship or the lack of a reasonable return is not proved, the Commission shall
deny the demolition application unless the Commission finds grounds to grant
the demolition application under the points contained in this subchapter.
         (f)   Demolition by neglect prohibited. The Commission shall not issue
a COA for demolition when the Commission determines:
            1.   That the condition of the structure is attributable to
demolition by neglect defined as a situation in which property owners, or
others having legal possession, custody, or control of a property, allowed the
condition of the property to suffer such deterioration, potentially beyond the
point of repair, as to threaten the structural integrity of the structure.
            2.   Conditions of neglect include, but are not limited to, the
following:
               a.    Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations, or other
vertical support that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling;
               b.    Deterioration of flooring or floor supports, roofs, or
other horizontal members that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or
buckling;
               c.    Deterioration of external chimneys that causes leaning,
sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling;
               d.    Deterioration or crumbling of exterior plasters or
mortars;
               e.    Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, and
foundations, including broken windows or doors;
               f.    Defective protection or lack of weather protection for
exterior wall and roof covering, including lack of paint, or weathering due to
lack of paint or other protective covering;
               g.    Rotting, holes, and other forms of decay;
               h.    Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails,
window and door frames, cornices, entablatures, wall facings, and architectural
details that causes delamination, instability, loss of shape and form, or
crumbling;
               i.    Heaving, subsidence, or cracking of sidewalks, steps, or
pathways;
               j.    Deterioration of fences, gates, and accessory structures;
               k.    Deterioration that has a detrimental effect upon the
special character of the district as a whole or the unique attributes and
character of the Historic Landmark; and
               l.    Deterioration that contributes to a hazardous or unsafe
condition.
            3.   In order to help determine neglect of a property, the
Commission may obtain and review documentation of any warnings or citations of
property maintenance violations filed on the property.
         (g)   Access to structure by the Planning and Development Director.
The property owners, or others having legal possession of the property, shall
provide the Planning and Development Director, or their designee, access to the
property in order to assist in the determination of the condition of the
structure as part of any application for a COA related to demolition.
   (I)   Time limit.
      (1)   The applicant shall submit a completed application for a zoning
permit within one year of the date the COA was approved or the approval shall
expire. The date of approval shall be the date the HPO issues the COA.
      (2)   Upon expiration of a COA, a new application, including all
applicable fees, shall be required.
      (3)   Upon written request, one extension of one year may be granted by
the HPO if the applicant can show good cause for a delay.
      (4)   The Commission may authorize alternative time limits for zoning
permit issuance based on the scale of the proposed development.
   (J)   Amendments of a COA after approval.
      (1)   Unless otherwise stated in this subchapter, any request for an
amendment or modification to the approved plans or conditions shall be done in
accordance with the procedures and standards established for its original
approval.
      (2)   The HPO shall have the authority to review and make a decision on
any amendment of a COA approval if they find that the amendment is minor or
technical in nature and will not have a substantive impact on the approved
work.
   (K)   Effect of a COA approval. The issuance of a COA shall not relieve the
property owner from complying with the requirements of other state and local
laws and regulations.
   (L)   Stop-work orders. In the event any work has been performed without the
required COA, at the request of the RPO, the Planning and Development
Department shall issue a stop-work order. In the event any work has been
performed which is not in accordance with the certificate, the Planning and
Development Department shall issue a stop-work order and may cite violators to
District Court. All work shall cease on the designated property. No additional
work shall be undertaken as long as the stop-work order shall continue in
effect. The City may apply in Circuit Court for an injunction to require
restoration and/or to enforce its stop-work order and the cost of such
proceeding shall be borne by the property owner if the City is successful in
its application for an injunction.

   (A)   The exterior features of any building or structure (including walls,
fences, light fixtures, steps, pavement, paths, or any other appurtenant
feature), or any type of outdoor advertising sign either designated as a
landmark, landmark site, or on a structure in a historic district shall be
preserved by the owner or such other person who may have legal possession,

required under this subchapter shall be computed by determining that percentage
of the compensation earned from the proportion of the work which was done or
performed within the City.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the individual employer to furnish
appropriate documentation with specific information as to hours/days spent
working outside the City. All such information must be on forms provided by the
Chief Financial Officer.
   (B)   In those cases where it is impossible for a business located outside
the City to apportion accurately the compensation provided above, because of
either the peculiar nature of the services provided by the employee or because
the usual basis of employment in the City is on a frequent basis of short
duration, apportionment may be made in accordance with the following
guidelines:
      (1)   For a period of 3 consecutive months, all employees of a business
shall keep a written log of the amount of time worked in the City and the
amount of compensation earned while working here.

subject to the withholding rate of 2.5%. The resulting amount will be paid by
the employer as a quarterly flat fee for a period of 2 years. At the end of
this 2-year period, this agreement shall be reviewed for adjustments.
      (3)   Any such agreement shall be in writing and attested to by the owner
of the business and the Chief Financial Officer.
      (4)   Any such agreement shall not apply to any compensation earned by
any employee while working 2 or more consecutive 8-hour periods in the City.

employer at the time of payment thereof. The payments required to be made on
account of the deductions by employers shall be made quarterly to the Chief
Financial Officer, for the quarterly periods ending September 30, December 31,
March 31 and June 30 of each year, on or before the last day of the month next
following the end of each quarterly period and each employer shall, at the same
time, make a return on a form furnished by the City; provided, however, that,
the failure or omission by an employer to deduct the license fee shall not
relieve an employee from the payment of the license fee and compliance with the

regulations promulgated under this subchapter.
   (B)   (1)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the fee required

business entity from the City nor the cessation of holding any corporate office
shall discharge that liability of any person; provided that the personal and
individual liability shall apply to each or every person holding the corporate

who fails to withhold or pay over to the City sums required to be withheld. If
the employer withholds but fails to pay the amounts withheld to the City, the

paid to the City. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien shall commence at
the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the City.
      (5)   Every fee imposed by this section and all increases, interest and
penalties thereon, shall become, from the time it is due and payable, a

therefor.
      (6)   If any business entity dissolves or withdraws from the City during
any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner surrenders or loses
its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution, withdrawal, or loss or
surrender of charter shall not defeat the filing of returns and the assessment
and collection of fee withheld for the period of that taxable year during which
the business entity had fees withheld in the City.
   (C)   (1)   The license fee is imposed on both residents and non-residents
of the City at the rate of 2.5% of all salaries, wages, commissions and other

         (d)   Fees paid to a director or officer of a corporation are subject
under this subchapter as in the case of any other employee;
         (e)   Tips received by waiters and other employees over $20 per month,
per employee or third party employee, are subject to the license fee and will
be reported in the same manner as regular earnings. Any business which provides
food and beverages for on premises consumption shall adhere to the following

            7.   If this estimation proves to be incorrect by more than 5%, the
employer shall take the following actions:
               a.   If the estimate is higher than the amount actually due, the
City will either refund this amount or permit its use as a credit against any
future license fees which may be due under this subchapter.

on or before January 31 of each year showing in the return his or her gross

Officer with all necessary documentation. The filings shall be done in
accordance with those procedures outlined in
§ 37.048. Any payments received after the due dates shall be subject to a

opinion of the City, it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return
of any business entity in order to audit the return, the City may compel the
business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and
schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed. The City may
also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the federal government.
               c.   It shall be the responsibility of persons who make Federal
Form 1099 "non-employee compensation" payments to natural persons other than
employees for services performed within the City to maintain records of such
payments and to report such payments to the City. Said payments must be
reported on by remitting Federal Form 1099 by February 28 of the year following
the close of the calendar year in which the non-employee compensation was paid.
If a business entity or person is not required to remit Federal Form 1099 to
the IRS, including but not limited to payments less than $600, they are still
liable to remit the equivalent information to the City. The information
required to be reported by said licensee shall include:
                  i.   Payer's name, address, social security and /or Federal
identification number.
                  ii.   Recipient's name and address.
                  iii.   Recipient's social security and/or Federal
identification number.
                  iv.   Amount of non-employee compensation paid in the
calendar year.
                  v.   Amount of non-employee compensation earned in the City
for the calendar year.
         (h)   The term GROSS RECEIPTS of a business falling into the category
of a business defined in §
37.071 means:
            1.   Where the business is formed by 1 or more individuals, each
individual shall compute his or her share of the gross receipts of the former
business that the individual was previously engaged in. The sum total of each
individual’s share, thus computed, shall be the gross receipts for the
business, as defined in §
37.080.
            2.   Example: Individual “A” of ABC partnership terminates his or
her association with ABC and forms a partnership with “Y,” who has terminated
his or her association with XYZ partnership. Both A and Y had 1/3 interest in
their prior partnerships. The gross receipts of the present “AY” partnership,
for purposes of applying for the initial license under this division, shall be
the amount of gross receipts of the last appropriate accounting period of ABC
partnership that were attributable to A’s 1/3 interest added to the amount of
gross receipts of the last appropriate accounting period of XYZ partnership
that were attributable to Y’s 1/3 interest. In the case where A or Y had been a
sole proprietorship prior to the AY partnership, the respective share to be
computed into the gross receipts of the “AY” partnership would be the total
gross receipts of the sole proprietorship in the appropriate accounting period
immediately preceding the formation of “AY” partnership.
         (i)   Any business which manufactures a product in the City and sells
this product at retail both within a location inside the City and a location
outside the City shall calculate gross receipts subject to the City’s fee in
the following manner:
            1.   Gross receipts from a product manufactured in the City and
sold by the manufacturer at a retail location within the City shall be assessed
at 100% without deduction.
            2.   Gross receipts from a product manufactured in the City and
sold by the manufacturer at a retail location outside the City shall be
calculated utilizing the formula established in division (1)(g) above.
            3.   Total gross receipts for this business shall be the sum of the
2 amounts in divisions (1)(i)1. and 2. above.
(1995 Code, § 3.20.040)
      (2)   (a)   If the sale was made for a consideration wholly in cash, the
total cash received constitutes the receipts.
         (b)   If the sale was executed on a deferred payment basis, the
portion paid in cash, to include any deposits, down payments, escrow or
security monies and the deferred balance, to be paid within a period subsequent
to the time of the initial sale, shall constitute the total receipts; provided,
however, that, the receipt of the deferred payment in the appropriate
accounting period subsequent to the appropriate accounting period in which the
gross receipts of the total sale were reported shall not constitute a receipt
under this division.
         (c)   If the sale was executed on a deferred payment basis and the
deferred payment was secured by a note or other evidence of indebtedness, the
amount of cash received, plus the face value of the note or indebtedness
constitutes the receipt; provided, however, that, the receipt of any payment on
the note or evidence of indebtedness in the appropriate accounting period
subsequent to the year of the deferred sale shall not constitute a receipt
within the meaning of this division.
         (d)   If the sale is an installment sale, the total amount of the
installments paid, or to be paid, constitutes the receipts, including any
interest or carrying charges. A person who sells or otherwise disposes of
personal property in trade or business on the installment plan must report as
receipts the total amount of consideration to be received from the installment
contract so long as the installment contract was executed during the period
covered by the return. Insofar as this division is concerned, it shall be
irrelevant as to whether or not title remains in the vendor until the property
is fully paid for and all of the conditions prescribed in the installment sale
are fully performed. It is provided, further, that, any receipt of installments
in the appropriate accounting period subsequent to the appropriate accounting
period in which the original installment sale was reported shall not constitute
a receipt within the meaning of this subchapter.
         (e)   If the sale is made by exchange of property of any kind,
pursuant to a barter transaction, the fair market value of the property
received in exchange constitutes the receipts. However, where a used article is
accepted in part payment of the purchase price, such as automobiles, furniture,
washing machines, radios, mechanical refrigerators, televisions and the like,
the seller of the new article shall report the sales price of the new article
less any allowance made for the used article; provided, however, that, when the
used article is sold, the sales price of the used article shall constitute
receipts within the meaning of this subchapter.
         (f)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where
income is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this ordinance. The
occupational license fee impose in this ordinance is assessed against income
before it is "passed through" these entities to the owners.
         (g)   It shall be allowed as a deduction to the amount reported as
gross receipts the amount which the business entity has declared to be
uncollectible as a bad debt and has so evidenced by an entry within the
accounting books of that business. The determination as to what can validly be
deducted as a bad debt, insofar as this division is concerned, will be made
pursuant to of the Internal Revenue Code of the United states. Where the person
has established a “bad debt reserve,” the amount of bad debt deductible under
this division will be only that amount which the business entity has added to
the bad debt reserve for the taxable year of the return being filed. Any
subsequent collection of a previously deducted bad debt will be included as
gross receipts in this year of collection.
         (h)   It shall be further allowed as a deduction to the amount
reportable as gross receipts, the amount of returns and/or allowances which the
business entity has made during the appropriate accounting period and has so
evidenced by an entry within the accounting books of that business.
(1995 Code, § 3.20.050)

storage of stock-in-trade or materials in connection therewith.
      (2)   Issuance of any license for a home occupation shall be solely for
the purpose of establishing a mailing address and office facilities which are
not open to the public. The license cannot be used for the purpose of offering
retail sales or services of any kind.
   INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. Any person who meets the following criteria:

the year in which the fee is due, exclusive of any amendments made subsequent

relation of employer and employee 1 with another, shall perform joint service
or sell joint property, or receive money or assets to which they are jointly
entitled, and 1 of such persons shall first receive the total sum due for the

established fee and having obtained the prescribed license therefor.
      (2)   The license shall be required of any business entity residing
outside the City or having a place of business outside the City limits, if the
business entity shall engage in business as mentioned in this division in the
City and who actually solicits and accepts business by holding himself out as

under this section. Any business entity renting a booth space in a farmer/flea

portion thereof.
   (C)   (1)   Any business entity performing general contracting or sub-

during the last fiscal year;
         (c)   The duration of time needed to complete the work is 3 days or
less;
         (d)   The contractor’s business location is not in the City; and
         (e)   Any license issued under these conditions will only be valid for
3 days. If the work performed lasts longer than 3 days or if the contractor
receives additional work in the City during the same fiscal year, he or she
will pay the prorated amount of the annual fee minus the initial $25 fee.
      (2)   On work valued at more than $21,428, any person engaging in the
business of contractor or builder under this section, who was not licensed as
such for the preceding fiscal year, shall pay a tentative license fee based
upon the total amount of contracts for work within the City held by him or her
minus the dollar amount of the work contracted to other sub- contractors and
shall furnish detailed information to the City’s Chief Financial Officer as to
the exact amount. On or before April 15 for any year, the licensee shall
furnish information to the Chief Financial Officer as to the exact amount of
the Newport gross business receipts for the preceding year. The final license
fee for the preceding year shall be based on this amount. If the final license
fee is less than the tentative license fee, the excess amount shall be refunded
to the licensee, but if it is more than the tentative fee, the licensee shall
pay the excess amount on or before the appropriate due date. Before issuing
this tentative license, the Chief Financial Officer may, in his or her
discretion, require the applicant to execute bond to the City with good and
sufficient surety to the effect that the final license fee will be paid in
full.
      (3)   On work valued at more than $50,000, any person engaging in the
business of contractor or builder under this section, who currently holds a
valid City occupational license, shall pay a tentative license fee based upon
the total amount of contracts for work within the City held by him or her minus
the dollar amount of the work contracted to other sub-contractors and shall
furnish detailed information to the City’s Chief Financial Officer as to the
exact amount. On or before April 15 for any year, the licensee shall furnish
information to the Chief Financial Officer as to the exact amount of the
Newport gross business receipts for the preceding year. The final license fee
for the preceding year shall be based on this amount. If the final license fee
is less than the tentative license fee, the excess amount shall be refunded to
the licensee, but if it is more than the tentative fee, the licensee shall pay
the excess amount on or before the appropriate due date.
      (4)   Neither the Building Inspector or the Historic Preservation Officer
of the City shall issue a permit or a certificate of appropriateness for the

operation for which a permit or a certificate of appropriateness is required,
to a contractor who has not paid the license fee prescribed by this section,

Building Inspector or Historic Preservation Officer a list of all
subcontractors, the mailing address and the amount of their gross contracts
when they are issued a building permit or a certificate of appropriateness for
the job. A copy of the list shall be furnished to the City’s Chief Financial
Officer. In the event all subcontractors and the amounts of their contracts
have not been determined at the time the building permit is first issued, it
shall be the duty of the general contractor to furnish the information
immediately as it becomes available. Failure by the general contractor to
provide this list of subcontractors or any use of unlicensed subcontractors by
a general contractor shall be sufficient grounds for the City’s Building
Inspector or Historic Preservation Officer to temporarily suspend all building
permits or certificates of appropriateness until the time as all license fees
are paid in full or the unlicensed subcontractors are removed from the job
site.
      (6)   In addition, no permit or certificate of appropriateness will be
issued to any general contractor who has indicated his or her intention to
employ any other subcontractor who has failed, after appropriate notice on
previous occasions, to pay any license fees prescribed by this division, by
other ordinance or subsequent amendments to the ordinance. In the event any
general contractor is observed employing any other subcontractor who has failed
to pay previous license fees, this shall be sufficient grounds for the City’s
Building Inspector or Historic Preservation Officer to temporarily suspend all
building permits or certificates of appropriateness until the time as all
license fees are paid in full or the subcontractor in violation is no longer
employed on the job site.
      (7)   (a)   Upon notice from the Chief Financial Officer that work on any
building or structure is being performed in violation of this division, the
work shall be immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner of the property involved or to the owner’s agent or
to the person doing the work and shall state the conditions under which work
may be resumed.
         (b)   Any person who shall continue any work in or about the structure
after having been served with a stop-work order, except the work as he or she
is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe conditions, or anyone
who alters, defaces or removes a stop-work order, shall be liable for the
restraints provided in §
37.091.

as this section is concerned.
   (C)   Where a business is formed from or by any individuals that have
previously been engaged in a business that has been liable for payment of a
license fee under this subchapter or any prior license fee ordinance of the
City, the business shall not qualify as a new business insofar as this division
is concerned; further, it is provided that where such a business is formed, the

each child attains age 18, but the combined payments to the children shall not

         (a)   The widow or widower is at least 40 years of age, otherwise

immediately together with an additional allowance on account of the child or
children.

estate shall be entitled to a death benefit equal to the total contributions
made by the member, without interest, or $300, whichever is greater.
      (2)   Upon death of a retired member, if no annuities shall be due or
payable, a death benefit shall be paid to the designated beneficiary or estate
of the member, equal to the excess, if any, of the total contributions made by
the member to this fund to the date of retirement without interest, over the
total annuity payments received by the member. The minimum payment in such case
shall be $300. If any annuities are payable after the death of a retired

38.047(B). Persons with 20 or more years of service may retire in accordance
with §

decision is remote or incidental, the City official or employee may participate

participating in a vote or decision, if in fact the interest is remote or
incidental.

is not a substantial interest and which has insignificant value.
         REMOTE INTEREST.

similar decisions is remote to the extent that the commission member would be
affected in common with the general public.

the City or who can be reasonably anticipated to do business with the City in

made in the ordinary course of business by an institution authorized by the
laws of the state to engage in the business of making loans or a lawful
contribution made to a political campaign, as long as the same are reported.
(1995 Code, § 2.52.150)

§§ 39.25 et seq. by any City official or employee is grounds for any type of
disciplinary action, including dismissal.

§ 74.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   PARADE PERMIT, SPECIAL EVENT, OUTDOOR DEMONSTRATION PERMIT. A permit
required by this chapter.
   PARADE. Any parade, march, ceremony, show, exhibition, pageant or procession
of any kind, or any similar display, consisting of persons, animals or vehicles
or a combination thereof, in or upon any street, sidewalk, park or other public
place in the City with an intent of attracting public attention that interferes
with the normal flow or regulation of traffic therein.
   SPECIAL EVENT. Any activity which occurs upon private or public property
that will affect the ordinary use of the public property, alleys, streets,
rights-of-way or sidewalks. This includes, but is not limited to fairs,
festivals, foot runs, bicycle runs and block parties. Private social gatherings
which will not require the use of City streets other than for lawful parking
are not included.
   OUTDOOR DEMONSTRATION. A public display of personal and/or group feelings
about a particular person or cause.
§ 74.03 PERMIT REQUIRED; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   No person shall engage in, participate in, aid, form or start any
parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration unless a parade or special
event permit shall have been obtained from the Chief of Police.
   (B)   This chapter shall not apply to:
      (1)   Funeral processions.
      (2)   Students going to and from school classes or participating in
educational activities, providing such conduct is under the immediate direction
and supervision of the proper school authorities.
      (3)   Governmental agencies acting within the scope of its functions.
§ 74.04 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   A person seeking issuance of a parade, special event, or outdoor
demonstration permit shall file an application with the Chief of Police on
forms provided by this office not less than 45 days before the date on which it
is proposed to conduct the parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration. The
Chief of Police may waive the minimum filing period and accept an application
filed within a shorter period if, after due consideration of the date, time,
place and nature of the parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration, the
anticipated number of participants and the City services required in connection
with the parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration, the Chief of Police
determines that the waiver will not present a hazard to public safety.
§ 74.05 STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   The Chief of Police shall issue a permit as provided for hereunder when,
after consideration of the application and from such other information as may
otherwise be obtained, he or she finds that:
   (A)   The conduct of the parade will not substantially interrupt the safe
and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route or the special
event or outdoor demonstration will not disrupt traffic within the City beyond
practical solution.
   (B)   The conduct of the parade will not require the diversion of so great a
number of police officers of the City to properly police the line of movement
and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police protection to the
City or that the special event or outdoor demonstration will not require the
diversion of so many public employees that allowing the event would
unreasonably deny service to the remainder of the City.
   (C)   The conduct of the parade will not require the diversion of so great a
number of ambulances as to prevent normal ambulance service to portions of the
City other than that to be occupied by the proposed line of march and areas
contiguous thereto.
   (D)   The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at assembly points
of the parade will not unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection
of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous to such assembly areas.
   (E)   The conduct of the parade will not interfere with the movement of fire
equipment en-route to a fire or will not interfere with access to fire stations
and fire hydrants.
   (F)   The parade is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its point
of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable delays en-route.
   (G)   The parade is not to be held for the sole purpose of advertising any
product, goods or event, and is not designated to be held purely for private
profit.
   (H)   The location of the parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration
will not cause undue hardship to adjacent businesses or residents.
   (I)   There is no other parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration
permit application for the same time and location that have been or will be
granted.
   (J)   There are no other parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration
permit applications that have been or will be granted for other locations that
would reduce police resources, in combination with the second application, to
such an extent that the welfare and safety of persons and property would be
adversely affected.
   (K)   The application for a outdoor demonstration fails to provide a
description of the purpose, including the date, time, and location.
   (L)   The application contains incomplete or false information or the
applicant fails to comply with the terms of this chapter.

the reasons for the denial of the permit and mail it to the applicant.
   (B)   If the permit is approved by the Chief of Police, an order of approval
shall be mailed to the applicant.
§ 74.07 APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   Any person aggrieved shall have the right to appeal the denial or revocation
of a parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration permit to the City
Manager. The appeal shall be accepted within 7 working days after the date of
the denial notice by filing a written notice with the City Clerk. The City
Manager shall act upon the appeal within 7 working days after its receipt.
§ 74.08 ALTERNATIVE PERMIT.
   The Chief of Police, in denying an application for a parade, special event,
or outdoor demonstration permit, shall be empowered to authorize the conduct of
the parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration on a date, at a time, or
over a route or location different than that named by the applicant. An
applicant desiring to accept an alternate permit shall, within 3 days after
notice of the action by the Chief of Police, file a written notice of his or
her acceptance with that office. An alternate parade, special event, or outdoor
demonstration permit shall conform to the requirements of, and shall have the
effect of a parade, special event, or outdoor demonstration permit under this
Chapter.

departments and such other agencies as deemed necessary and each department or
agency shall have 30 days to review and comment on the application. Immediately

detector installed adjacent to each sleeping area.
   (E)   In a dwelling containing 2 or more dwelling units or any rooming unit,
in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each dwelling
unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally located common

it very rough with the coarse aggregate protruding;
            8.   Cellar doors and coal bin covers that are not flush with the
sidewalk, have a smooth surface, projecting hinges or are structurally unsafe;
            9.   Cellar gratings that have opening measuring more than 5/8 inch

cellar openings or prismatic lights used as sidewalk over a subgrade;
            11.   Defective columns or beams supporting a sidewalk slab over a
subgrade;
            12.   Sidewalk material placed without prior approval of the City;
            13.   Sod area between the sidewalk and street that protrudes above
the sidewalk and impounds water or causes it to drain along the sidewalk, in
such cases the condition should be corrected by lowering the sod; (In cases
where the sod area on either side of the sidewalk is below the grade of the
sidewalk, fill shall be added and the area either sodded or seeded.)
            14.   Stumps, stones, private signposts or any other unauthorized
obstruction in the sidewalk surface;

or panels;
               b.   When a paver or panel is cracked, regardless of depth of
the crack, in a width of more than 5/8 inch;
               c. When the exposed surface of a paver or panel is uneven to a
degree so as to cause a potential trip hazard to pedestrians.

similar to an improved alley intersection; that have been placed without proper
approval from the City;
            7.   Driveways that are dipped across the sidewalk so as to create
an abrupt change of grade; (This condition normally exists where the driveway
at street edge of the sidewalk has been held several inches below the grade of
the sidewalk and the transition from the driveway to sidewalk grade is
accomplished in a very short distance.)
            8.   Abandoned driveways; curb to be restored only if sidewalk
abuts curb or if abandoned or unimproved driveway is being used illegally.
   (B)   (1)   Notice to repair a sidewalk as provided in division (A)(1) of

shall be responsible for all contractual arrangements and payment to their
contractor.
      (2)   The property owner may use the contractor hired by the City to make
the repairs and, upon completion, pay the cost of the repairs. The property
owner must sign an agreement authorizing the placing of a lien by the City
against the owner’s property if payment is not made in full when the repairs
are completed and the invoice for payment becomes due. Any property owner who
does not make payment in full when due will also be assessed a $100 document
preparation and processing fee.

repairs are completed, with the remaining annual installments being due on
April 1 of each year thereafter.

favor of the City encumbering the owner’s property in the amount of the repair
costs, plus interest and a $100 document preparation and processing fee. The
loan will be amortized over the repayment period at a rate to be determined at
the time the mortgage is executed with ten annual installments. Should an
annual installment be delinquent for 3 months or more, the City may, at its
option, immediately proceed to foreclose on its note and mortgages.
   (D)   (1)   A property owner who disputes the determination of the City
requiring repairs to or replacement of his or her sidewalk shall have 7 days to
file an appeal of the determination with Code Enforcement. The appeal shall be
heard by the City’s Existing Structure Board.
      (2)   Any determination not timely appealed shall be final.

interest at the rate of 12% per annum until paid and cause a lien to be filed
against the property in the amount.

become delinquent the City shall have a lien against the property for the
reasonable value of labor and materials used in remedying the situation. The
affidavit of the City Manager shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
amount of the lien and shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk. The

over all other subsequent liens, except state, county, school board, and City
taxes, and may be enforced by judicial proceeding.

§ 110.01 PURPOSE.
   The intent of the Board of Commissioners in amending legislation regulating
sexually oriented businesses within the City is to continue reasonable and
uniform regulations that will reduce the adverse impact that sexually oriented
businesses have in the City and to protect the health, safety, morals and
general welfare of the citizens of Newport.
§ 110.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   Based upon evidence and testimony originally presented at public meetings
before the Board of Commissioners and based upon the past experiences of the
City and the experiences of the County Attorney’s office prosecuting numerous
and varied offenses that have occurred in and around sexually oriented
businesses located within the City and based upon the documented experiences of
other governmental units within and without of the state in dealing with the
impact of sexually oriented businesses, the Board of Commissioners hereby
adopts the following findings of fact in support of the legislative action in
originally enacting and further amending this chapter, as follows:
   (A)   Businesses exist and may exist within the City where sexually oriented
activities occur as a commercial venture.
   (B)   Businesses exist or may exist within the City where the superficial
tissues of 1 person are manipulated, rubbed, stroked, kneaded and/or touched by
a second person, accompanied by the display of or exposure of specified
anatomical areas or dancers, entertainers, performers or other individuals,
who, for various forms of commercial gain, perform or are presented while
displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas.
   (C)   When the activities described in divisions (A) and (B) of this section
are present in a business within the City, other activities which are illegal,
immoral or unhealthful in nature tend to accompany them, to concentrate around
them, and are exacerbated or aggravated by them. Such other activities include,
but are not limited to the following: prostitution, pandering, solicitation for
prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful
materials, sale of possession of controlled substances and violent crimes
against persons and property.
   (D)   There is a higher incidence of certain types of criminal behavior
among employees of businesses engaged in sexually oriented activities described
in divisions (A) and (B) of this section than among employees of other types of
commercial businesses .
   (E)   When the activities described in divisions (A) and (B) of this section
are present in businesses within the City, they tend to attract an undesirable
number of transients, bring blight to neighborhoods, adversely affect
neighboring businesses, in various ways including, but not limited to, driving
away customers and causing hours of operation to be restricted, lower property
values of surrounding properties, promote crimes, particularly those as
detailed in division (C) of this section, impact on the morals and values of
the school children who must regularly be exposed to undesirable elements while
walking to and from school as well as after school hours, and ultimately lead
residents and other types of commercial businesses to move to other locations
or to fail to locate in the City.
   (F)   In order to preserve the public peace in good order and to safeguard
the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and of its citizens,
it is necessary and advisable for the City to regulate businesses such as those
described in divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
   (G)   Physical contact within businesses in which the sexually oriented
activities described in divisions (A) and (B) of this section occur between
persons exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to
the individual health of both individuals and promotes the spread of
communicable and social diseases.
   (H)   Businesses engaged in the operation of sexually oriented activities
described in divisions (A) and (B) of this section are commercial ventures,
operated for the purpose of making a profit, and as such are proper subjects
for regulation by the City in the interest of the health, safety, morals and
general welfare of its citizens and those individuals visiting the City.
   (I)   The sexually oriented activities described as occurring in the City
does not contain any element of protected communication and is expressly found
by the Board of Commissioners to be conduct rather than expression.
   (J)   The City incurs a financial burden in regulating and policing sexually
oriented businesses over and above occupational licensing fees and in a
disproportionate percentage as compared to other commercial business
activities.
(1995 Code, § 5.04.020)
   (K)   That the United States Supreme Court has held that local governments
may regulate through content-neutral, time, place and manner restrictions, so
long as the regulations are designed to serve the government interest and do
not unreasonably omit avenues of communication and are aimed, not at the
content of protected speech within said businesses, but rather at the secondary
effects the said businesses have upon the surrounding community.
   (L)   That the City has gained a reputation of success in both creating and
litigating such regulations.
   (M)   That the City has the continuing desire to project a decent and
progressive image and that such regulations contribute to the enhancement of
that interest.
   (N)   That the City now finds a need exists to review and revise its
ordinance herein, regarding adult entertainment or sexually oriented business
located within the City, in conjunction with the proposed licensing ordinance
for sexually oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus, submitted
to the Campbell County Fiscal Court from the commissioned study and report (the
Kelly and Cooper study), and recommendations of Duncan Associates, the findings
thereof being adopted herewith.

the holder of the license with the City Clerk. The charges shall be in writing
and each charge shall be clearly set out.

      (3)   At the hearing, the evidence shall be recorded and the introduction

thereof, shall be conclusive evidence that such a violation occurred. The
existence of any prior judgement of conviction for the same or similar offense,
under the same ownership/management as those being asserted as the basis for

patron constituting a violation of this section shall be presumed to be the act

by the licensee that it took reasonable measures to prevent the violations or
that the particular violation was entirely unprecedented in the establishment
and that the licensee took prompt corrective action and has now established
procedures to avoid such actions in the future may be considered in rebuttal to
that presumption.
      (7)   The Board of Commissioners shall render their decision after
deliberation, upon conviction of the hearing. Upon a finding that the license
holder has violated any of the provisions herein which could result in the
suspension or revocation of the license, the Board of Commissioners may

law.
   (D)   (1)   Renewal of any sexually oriented business license during a

long as charges against same are pending for a hearing before the Board of
Commissioners.
      (3)   In the event any sexually oriented business license is surrendered

hearing, or is revoked after hearing, no new license certificate shall issue to
any person when, in the discretion of the City’s License Inspector, same is
attempted for the sole purpose of allowing the previously surrendered or
revoked license holder, or the holder of a license surrendered in lieu of
revocation, to operate a business under a new sexually oriented business
license and merely in the name of another person, the same constituting a
“sham” application.

sales are proposed to be made;

the immediate area with debris, using excessive profanity or trespassing upon
private property in the immediate area.
      (4)   If the City’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator, upon an
annual review or upon complaint, shall find repeated violations of divisions
(D)(1) through (3), hereof, the Administrator may suspend, revoke or not renew
any existing Extended Hours license so issued. The Extended Hours License
holder shall have the right to appeal and request a hearing before the

determination to suspend, revoke or not renew any existing Extended Hours
License, otherwise the determination shall stand.
   (E)   (1)   It shall be the responsibility of the City’s Alcoholic Beverage
Control Administrator to investigate initial applications, transfers, and
renewals of Extended Hours licenses, and to make determinations upon
suspensions and/orrevocations of the Extended Hours licenses. The City’s

convictions at the business establishment and/or within or upon the licensed
premises, or there is determined to be an excessive number of police response
calls, as compared to the total number of such to other licensed premises, to
the location of the licensed premises for which the Extended Hours License has
been issued, within the annual period, then, upon a hearing if the non-renewal
is appealed, the City’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator shall not
renew the Extended Hours license
      (3)   The decision of the City’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator
shall be reduced to writing. In the event that the City’s Alcoholic Beverage
Control Administrator shall deny any initial application for an Extended Hours
license or, at the Administrator’s discretion, delay the issuance thereof, or
shall revoke or suspend any existing Extended Hours license, for cause, or
shall fail to renew any existing Extended Hours license, the applicant or
holder shall be permitted to appeal the decision of the City’s Alcoholic
Beverage Control Administrator to the City Manager, in writing, within 10 days
of the decision. The City Manager shall have the final determination and shall
notify the applicant or holder of his or her decision, in writing, within 10
days thereof. If the City Manager shall approve the appeal, the Administrator
shall instruct the City’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator to grant the
initial application or issue or renew the existing license. In the event of
further denial of the initial application or suspension or revocation of the
license, the applicant or holder shall be notified of his or her right to
further appeal to the Campbell Circuit Court within 30 days thereof.
   (F)   The time changes brought into effect by the provisions of Daylight
Savings Time shall have no effect upon the hours of operation of establishments
operating within an Extended Hours license and such establishments shall be
permitted to remain open and operating for the additional hour, lost or gained,
as if the same did not exist. Therefore, at 2:00 a.m. on the day when Daylight
Savings Time takes effect and the hour advances to 3:00 a.m., those
establishments operating within an Extended Hours license shall be permitted to
remain open for business until 3:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. They shall,
however, be required to close the business immediately thereafter. At 2:00 a.m.
on the day when Daylight Savings Time changes back to Eastern Standard Time and
the hour reverts to 1:00 a.m., those establishments operating with an extended
hours license shall be permitted to remain open for business until 1:30 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time. They shall, however, be required to close the business
immediately thereafter. On the day immediately following each, the hours of
operation for establishments operating with an Extended Hours license shall be
required to return to the normal operating hours of 1:00 a.m. to 2:30 a.m.
Eastern Daylight Time or Eastern Standard Time, whichever is applicable. The
purpose of this division is to enable Extended Hours license holders to
continue normal business operating hours, in terms of the usual actual time

§ 153.40 GENERALLY.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners, after adoption of at least the objectives
of the land use plan elements, shall divide the territory within their area of
jurisdiction into zones on an interim or permanent basis to promote public
health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City, to facilitate orderly
and harmonious development and the visual or historical character of the City
and to regulate the density of population and intensity of land use in order to
provide for adequate light and air.
   (B)   In addition, zoning may be employed to provide for vehicle parking and
loading space, as well as to facilitate fire and police protection and to
prevent the overcrowding of land, blight, danger and congestion in the
circulation of people and commodities and the loss of life, health or property
from fire, flood or other dangers.
   (C)   Zoning may also be employed to protect highways and other
transportation facilities, public facilities, including schools and public
grounds, historical districts, central business districts, natural resources
and other specific areas of the City which need special protection by the City.
(1995 Code, § 2.60.150)
§ 153.41 CONTENTS.
   The Board of Commissioners shall exercise the power to zone through zoning
regulations which shall contain:
   (A)   A text, which shall list the types of zones which may be used, and the
regulations which may be imposed in each zone, which must be uniform throughout
the zone.
      (1)   In addition, the text shall make provisions for the granting of
dimensional variances, conditional use permits and for non-conforming use of
land and structures and any other provisions which are necessary to implement
the zoning regulation.
      (2)   The Board of Commissioners shall regulate:
         (a)   The activity on the land, including filling or excavation of

grounds, aircraft, helicopter, rocket and spacecraft facilities, places having
unique interest or value, flood plain areas and other places having a special
character or use affected by or affecting their surroundings.
   (B)   The text shall provide that the Board of Commissioners, as a condition
to the granting of any zoning change, shall require the submission of a
development plan, which, where agreed upon, shall be followed:

agricultural, farming, dairying, stock-raising or similar purposes shall have
no regulations imposed as to building permits, certificates of occupancy,
height, yard, location of courts requirements for agricultural buildings,
except that:
      (1)   Setback lines may be required for the protection of existing and
proposed streets and highways; and
      (2)   All buildings or structures in a designated floodway or flood plain
or which tend to increase flood heights or obstruct the flow of flood waters

Board of Commissioners shall be required to pass a zoning regulation which
contains any changes or departures from the zoning regulation as proposed by
the Commission after the change has been referred to the Commission for its
recommendation.
   (C)   The procedure for adoption of the zoning regulation shall be the same
as for any other regulation or order; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
publication requirements, the zoning regulation shall be published by stating
the title and general description of the regulation and referring to the place
within the City where a copy of the complete regulation may be examined without
charge.
(1995 Code, § 2.60.170)
§ 153.43 AMENDMENTS GENERALLY.
   (A)   A proposal for amendment to any zoning regulation may originate with

(1995 Code, § 2.60.180) (Am. Ord. O-2024-03, passed 3-25-2024)
§ 153.44 AMENDMENTS OF MAP.
   (A)   Before any zoning map amendment is granted, the Commission shall find

and such finding shall be recorded in the minutes and records of the Commission
and the Board of Commissioners:
      (1)   The original zoning classification given to the property was
inappropriate or improper; or
      (2)   There have been major changes of an economic, physical or social
nature within the area involved which were not anticipated in the community’s
comprehensive plan and which have substantially altered the basic character of
the area.
   (B)   The City hereby adopts the provisions of KRS 100.2111 as its alternate
regulations concerning zoning map amendments.
(1995 Code, § 2.60.190) (Am. Ord. O-2010-023, passed 12-6-2010; Am. Ord. O-

within a subdivision by reference to, or by exhibition, or by any other use of
a plat of the subdivision, before the plat has received final approval of the
Commission and has been recorded. Any such instrument of transfer, sale or
contract shall be void and shall not be subject to be recorded, but all rights
of the purchaser to damages are hereby reserved. The description of the lot or
parcel by metes and bounds in any contract or instrument of transfer or other
document used in the process of selling or transferring same shall not exempt
the person attempting to transfer from penalties provided or deprive the
purchaser of any rights or remedies he or she may otherwise have.

the land in accordance herewith.
   (B)   When land is sold or transferred or a contract has been entered into
for the sale or transfer of land in violation of this chapter or Kentucky

both prior to and after the platting of the land by the owner of record as if a
plat had been filed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and
Kentucky Revised Statutes pertaining to subdivision regulations.
(1995 Code, § 2.60.250)
OFFICIAL MAP
§ 153.75 OFFICIAL MAP; WHEN ADOPTED.
   (A)   When all components of the comprehensive plan which are prescribed
herein as a minimum for the City and a public facilities improvement program
have been prepared and adopted, the Commission and Board of Commissioners shall
prepare and adopt an official map regulation.
   (B)   The regulation shall incorporate a map of the entire area under

prescribed by KRS 424 and shall recommend its approval or disapproval to the
legislative bodies.
(1995 Code, § 2.60.290)
§ 153.78 MODIFICATIONS.
   After the passage of the official map regulation for all or part of the

public hearing needs to be held for the additions to the official map.
(1995 Code, § 2.60.300)
§ 153.79 LEGAL STATUS.
   The passage of the official map regulation shall not be deemed as opening or
establishing of any street or as a taking or as an acceptance of any land for a
street, water course or public ground; nor shall it obligate the City to
improve or maintain any such street or facility.
(1995 Code, § 2.60.310)
§ 153.80 CONSTRUCTION RESTRICTED.
   For the purpose of preserving the integrity of the official map of the City,

parks and playgrounds, public schools or other public building sites shown on
the official map, except as provided in this section. The official map of a
City may include the area outside the City limits over which the approval of
subdivision plats is required. Any persons desiring to construct or materially
alter a building in the lines of any proposed facility shown on the official
map shall apply to the administrative official of the City for a building
permit. Unless the application is made and the permit is granted, no person
shall recover any damages for the taking for public use of any structure or
improvement constructed within the lines shown on the map and any such
structure or improvement shall be removed at the expense of the owner when the
land is acquired for public use.
(1995 Code, § 2.60.320)
§ 153.81 VARIANCE.
   If the land shown on the official map is not yielding a fair return, the
Board of Adjustment shall have the power to grant a permit for the building
which will, as little as practicable, increase the cost of future acquisition
and the Board may impose reasonable requirements as a condition of granting the
permits. Such a permit shall not be granted when the applicant will not be
substantially damaged by placing his or her building outside the boundary lines
of the proposed facility.
(1995 Code, § 2.60.330)
§ 153.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, organization, or corporation who violates any of the
provisions of this chapter or fails to obtain a requisite certificate of
appropriateness shall, upon conviction be guilty, of a Class B misdemeanor in
accordance with the Kentucky Revised Statutes for each lot or parcel which was
the subject of sale or transfer, or a contract for sale or transfer.

provided that site plans are submitted and approved by the zoning
administrator. Such expansion may only be permitted if all other applicable
requirements of this Ordinance are complied with.
SECTION 9.13 CONDITIONAL BUILDINGS AND USES:
   A.   DETERMINATION: The Board of Adjustment may authorize a conditional
building and use to be located within any zone in which the particular
conditional use is permitted by the use regulations of this Ordinance, if the
evidence presented by the applicant is such as to be established by
preponderance of the evidence:
      1.   That the proposed building and use at the particular location is
necessary or desirable to provide a service or facility which will contribute
to the general well being of the neighborhood or the community, and
      2.   That such building and use will not, under the circumstances of the
particular case be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of
persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to property or
improvements in the vicinity, and
      3.   That the proposed building and use will comply with any regulations
and conditions specified in this Ordinance for such building and use.
   B.   CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS: In accordance with KRS 100.237 the Board of
Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide applications for conditional
use permits to allow the proper integration into the community of uses which
are specifically named herein which may be suitable only in specific locations
in the zone only if certain conditions are met:
      1.   The Board of Adjustment may approve, modify, or deny any application
for a conditional use permit. If it approves such permit it may attach
necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more
things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a
continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board's minutes
and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference to the specific
section in the zoning regulation listing the conditional use under
consideration. In addition, said conditional use permit shall be recorded in
the office of the County Clerk and one (1) copy of said permit attached to the
deed for the property for which it is issued. The Board shall have power to
revoke conditional use permits, or variances for noncompliance with the
condition thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have a right of action to
compel offending structures or uses removed at the cost of the violator and may
have judgment in personam for such cost.
      2.   Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant
from complying with all of the requirements of this Ordinance, the building
code, housing code and other regulations of the City of Newport.
      3.   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within the time limit set by the Board or within twelve (12) consecutive
calendar months from date of issuance, such conditional use permit shall not
revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing.
Exercised as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for
the construction of the main building or other improvement has been let; or in
the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is under
construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving
substantial investment shall be under contract, in development or completed.
When construction is not a part of the use, exercised shall mean that the use
is in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.
      4.   The Zoning Administrator shall review all conditional use permits,
except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least
once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure when
the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is
complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use
permit. If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on
the conditional use permit, the Zoning Administrator shall report the fact in
writing to the chairman of the Board of Adjustment. The report shall state
specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the
conditions on the conditional use permit, and a copy of the report shall be
furnished to the landowner at the same time that it is furnished to the
chairman of the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall hold a hearing on the
report within a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one week prior to the
hearing. If the Board of Adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the report
of the Zoning Administrator are true and that the landowner has taken no steps
to comply with time between the date of the report and the date of the hearing,
the Board of Adjustment may authorize the Zoning Administrator to revoke the
conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause the
termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit
authorizes.
      5.   Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional use permit
and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely
and permanently satisfied, the Zoning Administrator, upon request of the
applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions
have been satisfied, and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions
have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of the
conditional use permit which is on file with the county clerk, as required in
KRS 100.344. Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the other
requirements of this Ordinance, will be treated as a permitted use.
      6.   When an application is made for a conditional use permit for land
located within or abutting any zoning district, written notice shall be given
at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the public hearing on the application
to the applicant, and owners of every parcel of property adjoining the property
to which the application applies. Written notice shall be by first class mail
with certification by the board's secretary that the notice was mailed. It
shall be the duty of the applicant to furnish to the board the name and address
of an owner of each parcel of property as described in this subsection. Records
maintained by the property valuation administrator may be relied upon
conclusively to determine the identity and address of said owner. In the event
such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, then the
person notified by mail shall be the president or chairperson of the owner
group, which administers property commonly, owned by the condominium or
cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two (2) or more co owners
of an adjoining property who are listed in the property valuation
administrator's records as having the same address.
   C.   RE-USE OF PREVIOUSLY APPROVED OR EXISTING NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS OR
STRUCTURES: To prevent the abandonment of conditional use structures and to
promote their adaptive re-use in all zones within the city, previously approved
structures may, subject to the approval of the Board of Adjustments, be
approved as a new conditional use allowing higher residential density than the
underlying zone would permit, the operation of a commercial, non- industrial,
use or a combination of both subject to the following restrictions:
      1.   The adaptive reuse of a building or structure that existed prior to
the effective date of this code may be considered by the Board of Adjustment
through the conditional use permit process.
      2.   Screening pursuant to Section
9.16;
      3.   Fences, walls and obstruction to view requirements of Article XII;
      4.   Sign regulations pursuant to Article XV;
      5.   In residential zones, the permitted commercial uses shall be
compatible with the surrounding zone;
      6.   The adaptive re-use shall be located within the existing conditional
use structure; and
      7.   Parking per Section
13.1.
      8.   The adaptive reuse of such pre-existing buildings shall only be
allowed where the Board of Adjustment makes a determination that an existing
building on the site cannot be readily used for a principal use that is
otherwise allowed in the applicable zoning district, due to the design of the
building.
      9.   The proposed use of the building shall be limited to principal uses
that are specifically allowed in
Table 6 and
Table 4 of the Newport Zoning Code.
      10.   The proposed reuse of the building shall be one that the Board of
Adjustment finds will have minimal impact on the surrounding neighborhood based
on the consideration of the conditional use criteria contained herein.
      11.   The adaptive reuse application must demonstrate that the exterior
appearance of the building shall not be altered unless otherwise approved by
the Board of Adjustment as part of a conditional use approval. This shall not
prevent the applicant from renovating the building so that it complies with all
applicable building and fire codes.
      12.   If the pre-existing building is demolished or damaged more than 60
percent of the market value of the building, then the remainder of the building
shall be demolished and the adaptive reuse approval shall expire. After such
expiration, only a permitted use in the applicable zoning district may be
authorized in accordance with this code.

just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
      FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION: As related in Article 6, Appeals and Variance
Procedures, of this ordinance, means that the variance granted must not cause
fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the
City of Newport will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure
adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for
fifty to one hundred years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed
below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased
risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the
community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and
suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future
owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood
damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
      FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY: A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
      GOVERNING BODY: The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality
that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
      HAZARD POTENTIAL: The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
      HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
      HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
         1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
         2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
         3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
         4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
            a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
            b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
      INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC): Increased cost of compliance coverage
means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a
substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and
that is required to bring a substantially damaged building into compliance with
the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
flood proofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any
combination thereof.
      ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential buildings
(this category includes public or government buildings, such as schools,
libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
      LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): An official FEMA determination, by letter,
to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's include the following
categories:
         1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA): A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was inadvertently included in a designated SFHA. A
LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property
is not located in a SFHA.
         2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
         3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION - BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F): A determination
that a structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill
above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
      LEVEE: A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
      LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
      LIMITED STORAGE: An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
      LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE: The lowest elevation of the sidewalk, patio,
attached garage, deck support, basement entryway or grade immediately next to
the structure and after the completion of construction.
      LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this ordinance.
      MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or
without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required
utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar
transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
and intended to be improved property. The term "manufactured home" does not
include a "recreational vehicle" (see Recreational Vehicle).

      MAP PANEL NUMBER: The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a
letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel.
The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter "A" is not used by FEMA, the letter "B" is the first
revision.)
      MARKET VALUE: The property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and
seller), excluding the value of the land as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. Market value of the structure can be established by
independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of
structure (Actual Cash Value) or adjusted assessed values.
      MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL): The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on the community's FIRM. For purposes of this ordinance, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVO) of 1988.
      MITIGATION: Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
costs of disaster response and recovery.
      MUDSLIDE (i.e. MUDFLOW): Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a
dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water
on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e. mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is
in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
      MUDSLIDE (i.e. MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT: The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.
mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.

flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
      NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD): As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRM's. Refer to

commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation
adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
      NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

than 6 months duration.
      NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD): As corrected in 1988, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRM's and Digitally Referenced FIRM's
(DFIRM's). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM panel legend for correct datum.)
      OBSTRUCTION: Includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
      ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD) (SEE BASE FLOOD): The flood that
has a 1-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to inundation by
the 100-year flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26-percent
chance of experiencing such a flood with the SFHA.
      PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY: A community that voluntarily elects to
participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management
regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.

temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
      REGULAR PROGRAM: The phase of a community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and flood
elevations determined in the FIS.
      REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
See Base Flood.
      REMEDY A VIOLATION: The process by which a community brings a structure
or other development into compliance with State or local floodplain management
regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impact of non-
compliance. Reduced impact may include protecting the structure or other
affected development from flood damages, Implementing the enforcement
provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations,
or reducing state or federal financing exposure with regard to the structure or
other development.
      REPAIR: The reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing
structure.
      REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the

         2.   Two or more separate claim payments (building payments only)
where the total of the payments exceeds the current market value of the
property.
         In either case, two of the claim payments must have occurred within
ten years of each other. Multiple losses at the same location within ten days
of each other are counted as one loss, with the payment amounts added together.

other improvement of a structure, taking place during a 1-year period in which
the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
         a.)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code Enforcement Official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
         b.)   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
      SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS OR SUBDIVISIONS:

      1.   LANDS TO WHICH THIS ORDINANCE APPLIES. This ordinance shall apply to
all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), areas applicable to KRS 151.250 and, as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator or other delegated, designated, or
qualified community official as determined by the City of Newport from
available technical studies, historical information, and other available and
reliable sources, areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Newport which
may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect
the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Newport.
      2.   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Campbell County, with the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS), other supporting data and any
subsequent amendments thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to
be a part of these regulations by Newport, and for those land areas acquired by
Newport through annexation. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area
of applicability of this ordinance and may be supplemented by studies for other
areas which allow implementation of this ordinance and which are recommended to
the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator and are enacted by City
Council pursuant to statutes governing land use management regulations. The FIS
and/or FIRM are permanent records of Newport and are on file and available for
review by the public during regular business hours at City Offices at 998
Monmouth Street, Newport, Kentucky.
      3.   ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. A Development Permit shall be
required in conformance with the provision of this ordinance prior to the
commencement of any development activities in the special flood hazard areas
(SFHA). See Article 4, Section B for instructions and explanation.
      Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished by
the Floodplain Administrator.
      4.   COMPLIANCE. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance
with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable state regulations.
Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Newport from taking such
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
      5.   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS. This ordinance is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another ordinance, easement,
covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
      6.   INTERPRETATION. In the interpretation and application of this
ordinance, all provisions shall be:
         1)   Considered minimum requirements;
         2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
         3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
      7.   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. The degree of flood protection
required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part
of the City of Newport, any officer or employee, thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder.
      8.   ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION NOTICE AND PENALTIES.
         1)   Civil Offense: If, at any time, development occurs which is not
in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain development permit and
any approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
         2)   Notice of Violation: If, at any time, a duly authorized employee
or agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this ordinance including obtaining or complying with the terms
and conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved
modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain
Administrator shall issue a notice to the person responsible for the violation
and/or the property owner, stating the facts of the offense or violation, the
section of this ordnance and/or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how
the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into conformity with
this ordinance or with the approved permit, and within what period of time the
remedy is to occur, which period of time shall be reasonable and shall be
determined by the nature of the violation and whether or not it creates a
nuisance or hazard. The remedy may include an order to stop work on the
development. The notice shall also state that a citation may be forthcoming in
the event that the requested remedies and corrective actions are not taken,
which citation will request a civil monetary fine and shall state the maximum
fine which could be imposed. See below.
         3)   Notice of Citation: If, at any time, a duly authorized employee
or agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this ordinance including obtaining or complying with the terms
and conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved
modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain
Administrator may issue a citation to the offender stating the violation, prior
notices of violation issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the
development into conformity with this ordinance or with the approved permit,
and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or
penalties are recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the
citation is issued shall respond to the citation within seven (7) days of the
date the citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections
set forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven (7) days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
         4)   Penalties: Violation of the provisions of this ordinance or
failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance
or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person
who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements
shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no less than $500 or imprisoned for
not more than 90 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
Floodplain Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violation.
   C.   ADMINISTRATION.
      1.   DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR. The City of Newport hereby
appoints the Development Services Director to administer, implement, and
enforce the provisions of this ordinance by granting or denying development
permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein referred to as the
Floodplain Administrator.
      2.   ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. A Development Permit shall be
obtained before any construction or other development begins within any special
flood hazard area established in Article 3, Section B. Application for a
Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished by Floodplain Administrator
prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to,
the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location
of the foregoing. Endorsement of floodplain administrator is required before a
state floodplain construction permit can be processed. Specifically, the
following information is required.
         1)   Application Stage.
            a)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
            b)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level to which any
non-residential structure will be flood-proofed;
            c)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in Article 5, Section B (2) and Section D (2);
            d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
         2)   Construction Stage. Upon placement of the lowest floor, and
before construction continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction
means, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator and to the State a certification of the elevation of the lowest
floor or flood-proofed elevation, as built, in relation to Mean Sea Level. In
AE, A1-30, AH, and A zones where the Community has adopted a regulatory Base
Flood Elevation, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same.
         When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
      3.   DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR. The
Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed, authorized and
directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this ordinance.
The Floodplain Administrator is further authorized to render interpretations of
this ordinance, which are consistent with its spirit and purpose by granting or
denying development permits in accordance with its provisions. The duties and
responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be
limited to the following:
         1)   Permit Review: Review all development permits to ensure that:
            a)   Permit requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied;
            b)   All other required state and federal permits have been
obtained: review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have
been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 u.s.c 1334.;
            c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner;
            d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the
carrying capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this ordinance,
"adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development
will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot
at any point.
         2)   Review and Use of Any Other Base Flood Data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Article 3, Section B,
the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state
agency, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Article 5.
Any such information shall be submitted to Newport for adoption.
         3)   Notification of Other Agencies:
            a)   Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division of Water,
and any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory
authority prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse, and
            b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA); and
            c)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
         4)   Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
            a)   Certification required by Article 5, Section B (1) (lowest
floor elevations) as shown on an accurately completed and certified Elevation
Certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to Mean Sea
Level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially
improved structures, in accordance with Article 4, Section B (2);
            b)   Certification required by Article 5, Section B (2) (elevation
or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown on an accurately
completed and certified FEMA flood proofing certificate. Verify and record the
actual elevation (in relation to Mean Sea Level) to which the new and
substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed, in accordance with
Article 4, Section B (2);
            c)   Certification required by Article 5, Section B (3) (elevated
structures);
            d)   Certification of elevation required by Article 5, Section E
(1) (subdivision standards);
            e)   Certification required by Article 5, Section B (5) (floodway
encroachments);
            f)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
maintained;
            g)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance; and
            h)   Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this
ordinance as specified in Article 3, Section H.
         5)   Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
            a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Article 6, Section (3)
a;
            b)   When base flood elevation data and floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with Article 3, Section B, then the Floodplain
Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonable utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source,
in order to administer the provisions of Article 5;
            c)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure,
the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with Article 5, Section B (2)
a floodproofing certificate;
            d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance
shall be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be
open for public inspection.
         6)   Right of Entry.
            a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this ordinance, or whenever the floodplain administrator has
reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any
premises any condition or ordinance violation which makes such building,
structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the floodplain
administrator may enter such building, structure or premises at all reasonable
times to inspect the same or perform any duly imposed upon the floodplain
administrator by this ordinance.
            b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, the floodplain
administrator shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such
building, structure, or premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a
reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control
of such request entry.
            c)   If entry is refused, the floodplain administrator shall have
recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
            d)   When the floodplain administrator shall have first obtained a
proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no
owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any
building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is
made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the floodplain
administrator for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this
ordinance.
         7)   Stop Work Orders.
            a)   Upon notice from the floodplain administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this ordinance shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the person
performing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be
resumed.
         8)   Revocation of Permits.
            a)   The floodplain administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of this ordinance, in case there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based.
            b)   The floodplain administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this ordinance.
         9)   Liability.
            a)   Any officer, employee, or member of the floodplain
administrator's staff, charged with the enforcement of this ordinance, acting
for the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his/her duties,
shall not thereby render personally liable, and is hereby relieved from all
personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a
result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his/her duties. Any
suit brought against any officer, employee, or member because of such act
performed by him/her in the enforcement of any provision of this ordinance
shall be defended by the department of law until the final termination of the
proceedings.
         10)   Expiration of Floodplain Construction Permit.
            a)   A floodplain development permit, and all provisions contained
therein, shall expire if the "start of construction" has not occurred within
one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days from the date of its issuance.
   D.   PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
      1.   GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas
the following provisions are required:
         1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy;
         2)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard
shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for
resisting wind forces;
         3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
         4)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
         5)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding; and if
         6)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures;
         7)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
         8)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;
         9)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed
to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
         10)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance
shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this
ordinance;
         11)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance,
shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not furthered, extended, or
replaced.
      2.   SPECIFIC STANDARDS. In all special flood hazard areas where base
flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in Article 3, Section B,
the following provisions are required:
         1)   Residential Construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than 2 feet
above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used
to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate automatic
equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall be provided in
accordance with standards of Article 5, Section B (3).
            a)   In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the
highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number
specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest
adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
            b)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than 2 feet above
such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations)
Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical
requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The applicant shall provide cross
sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base Flood
Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross
sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations.
            c)   In all other Zones, elevated 2 feet above the base flood
elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
         2)   Non-residential Construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with Article 5, Section B (1) or together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities:
            a)   Be floodproofed to an elevation 10 feet (2ft from base with
8ft first floor) above the level of the base flood elevation so that the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water;
            b)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
            c)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification along
with the design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator;
            d)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in Article 5,
Section B(4);
            e)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an
elevation 10 feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this requirement
must meet or exceed the standards of Article 5, Section B (3).
         3)   Elevated Structures. New construction and substantial
improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include
fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the
lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed
to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
            a)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
               (i)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
               (ii)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above foundation Interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or
higher than the exterior foundation grade); and
               (iii)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves,
or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
            b)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
            c)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
finished or partitioned into separate rooms.
         4)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard
established in Article 3, Section B, are areas designated as floodways. Since
the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the
following provisions shall apply:
            a)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
            b)   If Article 5, Section B (5) is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 5.
      3.   STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/
OR FLOODWAYS. Located within the special flood hazard areas established in
Article 3, Section B, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been
provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the
following provisions apply:
         1)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
         2)   New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall
be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with
Article 3, Section B.
      4.   STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES. Located within the special
flood hazard areas established in Article 3, Section B, are areas designated as
shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base
flood depths of one to three feet (1 - 3'), where a clearly defined channel
does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
         1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall:
            a)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
         2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall:
            a)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
            b)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as stated in Article 5, Section B (2).
      5.   STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
         1)   All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area
and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage;
         2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
         3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
         4)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available, base flood elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals and
other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided;
         5)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed
structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base
flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
      6.   STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE
LETTER 'A'. For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas
designated 'A' the following provisions shall apply:
         1)   Must be non-habitable;
         2)   Must be anchored to resist floatation and lateral movement;
         3)   Must be provided with flood openings in accordance with the
standards of Article 5, Section B (3);
         4)   Must be built of flood resistant materials to 10 feet above the
base flood elevation;
         5)   Can only be used for storage or parking; and
         6)   Must not be modified for a different use after permitting.
      7.   CRITICAL FACILITIES. Construction of new critical facilities shall
be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year
floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible
within the floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no
feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within
the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the base
flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken
to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
   E.   APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
      1)   Nature Of Variances.
         The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
         It is the duty of the City of Newport to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
      2)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board.
         a)   Appeals to this ordinance shall be made to the Board of
Adjustment.
      3)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
         a)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this ordinance and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this ordinance.
         b)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment
may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky Revised
Statutes.
      4)   Variance Procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Board of
Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and the:
         a)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
         b)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
         c)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
         d)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
existing or proposed facility;
         e)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the
case of functionally dependent use;
         f)   Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
         g)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
         h)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
         i)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
         j)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
         k)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
      5)   Conditions for Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Board of Adjustment may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this ordinance.
         a)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
         b)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this ordinance. For example, in the case of variances
to an elevation requirement, this means the City of Newport need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City of Newport
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
         c)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            (i)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            (ii)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            (iii)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
         d)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and
the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost
of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
         e)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
         f)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Article 6 (4) are
satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in
additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
      6)   Variance Notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
         a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
         b)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Campbell County PVA and shall be recorded in
a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
         c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and
report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      7)   Historic Structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(Ord. O-2021-008, passed 7-19-2021)
SECTION 9.22 REGULATIONS CONCERNING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS:
Any proposed development requiring the construction of streets (including curb
and gutters), sidewalks, sewers (sanitary and storm), water lines or other
improvements, as herein defined, shall be required to be designed and
reconstructed in accordance with the applicable articles and sections of the
Newport Subdivision Regulations, as amended.
SECTION 9.23 CREATION OF A DESIGN REVIEW BOARD
   A.   Establishment of a Design Review Board to oversee design of the
following structures and areas.
      1.   Buildings within Redevelopment areas.
      2.   New buildings over 4,000 square feet in commercial zones.
      3.   Residential buildings in developments of 10 or more units.
   B.   The Board will review architectural guidelines as they apply throughout
the City. Recommendations will be made to the Planning Commission.
SECTION 9.24 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS (PUD)
   A.   PURPOSE: The purposes of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Regulations
are to: promote flexibility in design and permit planned diversification to the
relationships between location of and types of uses and structures; promote the
advantages of modern large scale site planning for community development
through the efficient use of land, facilitating a more economic arrangement of
buildings, circulation systems, land uses, and utilities; preserve, to the
greatest extent possible, the existing landscape features and amenities, and to
utilize such features in a harmonious fashion; providing for more usable and
suitably located recreation facilities, other public and common facilities than
would otherwise be provided under conventional land development procedures, but
always with the intention of furthering the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   B.   ZONES PERMITTING PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:  A Planned Unit Development
may be permitted in any zone where it is listed as “Permitted Principal Use”,
provided all conditions or provisions as set forth in this section are met and
a public hearing is held in accordance with requirements of KRS Chapter 424 on
the concept development plan.
   C.   GENERAL: Areas of land to be developed under the provisions of this
section of the Ordinance shall be controlled by the following general
guidelines and requirements:
      1.   Permitted Uses: All uses within a PUD are determined by the
provisions of this Section and the approved plan of the project concerned.
         a.   Residential Uses: Residential Uses may be of a variety of types
including single family, two-family and multi family dwelling units. In
developing a balanced community, the use of a variety of housing types
including zero lot line, cluster, rowhouse and townhouses shall be deemed in
keeping with this section.
         b.   Commercial, Service, Other Non Residential Uses: Commercial,
industrial and other non residential uses may be included in a PUD subject to
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Such uses, their locations, and
commercial area designs shall be compatible with the residential uses. This
section encourages a mixture of residential support uses to improve economic
development of the PUD, specifically, and to the community, in general.
Commercial, business, or industrial uses shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission to determine the following:
            (1)   That the uses permitted are necessary or desirable and are
appropriate with respect to the purpose of this PUD Section.
            (2)   That the uses are not of such nature or so located as to
exercise a detrimental influence on the PUD nor on the surrounding
neighborhood.
            (3)   That the areas and uses are planned as an integral part of
the PUD.
            (4)   That the uses are located and so designed as to provide
direct access to a collector or an arterial street without creating traffic
congestion or hazard.
      2.   Minimum Area Requirements: The minimum area required for a PUD shall
be a gross land area of five (5) acres if used for residential zone purposes.
Provided, however, no commercial uses shall be permitted in a PUD containing a
gross land area less than ten (10) acres. Further provided, however, that no
manufacturing uses shall be permitted in a PUD containing a gross land area of
less than twenty (20) acres.
      3.   Setback Requirements: The location of all structures shall be as
shown on the final approved plat. Minimum lot size, front, rear, and side yard
lines, and lot width shall be established by the Planning and Zoning Commission
at the time of Concept Approval, consistent with the intent of this Chapter and
sound planning practices. Planning and Zoning Commission may be guided by
standards set elsewhere in this ordinance for comparable conditions and by
common good practice. The relationship of buildings to each other, to the local
street system, and to open space land shall be consistent with the intent of
this Section
      4.   Intensity of Land Use: Because land is used more efficiently in a
PUD, improved environmental quality can often be produced with a greater number
of dwelling units per gross acre than usually permitted in a traditionally
zoned district. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine in each case
the appropriate land use and dwelling unit density for individual projects or
sections thereof. However, the following guidelines shall be adhered to:
followed unless special circumstances render an exception:
         a.   Residential Densities: Residential Densities are to be governed
by the approved underlying zones.
         b.   Land Use Ratios:
            (1)   Land Use ratios are to be determined based on the underlying
zones and approved preliminary development plan.
      5.   Common Property: Common property in a PUD is a parcel or parcels of
land, together with the improvements thereon, the use and enjoyment of which
are shared by the owners and occupants. When common property exists, the
ownership of such common property may be either public or private. When common
property exists, satisfactory arrangements shall be made for the improvement,
operation, and maintenance of such common property and facilities, including
private streets, drives, service and parking areas, and recreational and open
spaces. The landowner shall provide for and establish an organization for the
ownership and maintenance of any private common open space, and such
organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common open
space.
      6.   Conflict of Restrictions: Wherever there is a conflict or difference
between the provisions of this section and those of the other sections of this
ordinance, the provisions of this section shall prevail. Subjects not covered
by this section shall be governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere
in this ordinance unless otherwise approved by the plan commission.
      7.   Utilities: All utilities, including communication and electrical
systems, shall be placed underground within the limits of a PUD. Appurtenances
to these systems may be accepted.
      8.   Streets: The design and designation of all streets, public or
private, shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission where
necessary. Because of the nature of a PUD and the intent of this section, the
overall shape and dimension of the street right of way shall be at the
discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      9.   Home Owners Association: There shall be an established Home Owners
Association and its by laws and other similar deed restrictions which provide
for the control and maintenance of all common areas, recreation facilities, or
open spaces shall meet with the approval of the Planning Commission. If any
open space or recreational facility is to be used solely by the residents of
the PUD, adequate provisions shall be made for assessments against the property
within the project so that such facilities can be properly maintained and
operated.
      10.   Commercial Design: The plan of the project shall provide for the
integrated and harmonious design of buildings in commercial and industrial
areas and such parcels shall be developed in park-like surroundings utilizing
landscaping and existing woodlands as buffers to screen lighting, parking
areas, loading areas, and other features from the adjoining and surrounding
residential areas.
      11.   Design guidelines shall be submitted and approved by Planning and
Zoning along with the preliminary development plan

to allow for changed circumstances and conditions unforeseen at the time of the
original approval.
      3.   Request for Changes - if in the development of the site, it becomes
apparent that certain elements of the plan are not feasible and in need of
significant modification, the applicant shall then present his solution to the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall then
determine whether or not the modified plan is still in keeping with the intent
of the Comprehensive Plan and zoning district with respect to the specific
property. If a negative decision is reached, the site plan shall be considered
as disapproved. The applicant may then produce another site plan solution. If
an affirmative decision is reached, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall so
notify the Zoning Administrator, stating all of the particulars of the matter
and authorizing the modifications as approved.
      4.   Expiration of Approval - approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall expire after a period of five (5) years from the approval of
the PUD’s Development Plan unless the development is fifty one percent (51%)
completed in terms of public improvements such as power, gas, water, and
sanitary sewers, in which latter instance an extension of time may be granted
by the Planning and Zoning Commission not to exceed five (5) successive periods
of two (2) years each.

SECTION 9.29 TREES
   TREE CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION REQUIREMENTS:
   The following requirements shall apply for all development and/or
subdivision plans submitted for new development in any zone:
      1.    A tree inventory plan shall be submitted and reviewed in
conjunction with all development and/or subdivision plans and before any
clearing and/or grading takes place on the property. The tree inventory plan
must be prepared by an arborist or other qualified tree specialist, and the
protective tree barriers must be in place before any clearing and/or grading
takes place on the property. The tree inventory plan shall include all trees
with a diameter of six (6) inches or more as measured 12" above the ground for
the entire site and contain information on species, diameter, and condition, as
well as the location of all such trees within the buildable area and within
twenty (20) feet of the perimeter of the buildable area. The tree inventory
plan shall also identify any landmark tree(s) and delineate the buildable area
of a proposed development. The Planning and Zoning Commission may permit the
removal of a tree outside the buildable area, with the advice of the City
Arborist, pursuant to the requirements contained elsewhere in this section,
provided tree removal of the tree is reasonably required to develop the parcel
in compliance herewith.
      2.   All trees to be saved outside of the buildable area of a development
shall be conspicuously designated with suitable protective tree barriers as
designated herein or as otherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator.
Approved tree protective barriers shall be installed along the outermost
dripline around the tree protection zone. Protecting groups or groves of two or
more trees is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-
specimen) trees that may be scattered throughout a development site. The layout
of development improvements, utilities, access drives, grading, etc., of a site
shall accommodate the required tree protective zones. The public improvements
shall be placed between tree protective zones unless the placement of same
causes undue hardship on the developer as determined by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Upon consultation with the City Arborists, if the Planning and
Zoning Commission determines that public improvements and/or utilities may be
placed within a tree protective zone, the installation of same shall occur by
way of tunneling rather than trenching or other method as approved by The
Planning and Zoning Commission.
Construction site activities including, but not limited to material storage,
parking, or concrete washout shall not encroach into any tree protection zone
without the prior approval of the Zoning Administrator. Any tree irreparably
damaged or destroyed within a tree protection zone as a result of construction
activity shall be removed and replaced with a tree at least two inches (2")
caliper by the owner and/or developer at a ratio described in the table below
for every tree irreparably damaged or destroyed. The species of the replacement
trees must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative.
 
Size of Tree Damaged/Destroyed Number of Required Replacement Trees per Tree
                               Damaged/Destroyed
6-8 inches                     2
9-12 inches                    4
13-20 inches                   5
22-26 inches                   6
27 inches and above            10
 
Tree protection zones shall be delineated with typical temporary construction
fencing or continuous rope or flagging. In either case, the tree protection
barrier shall be accompanied by “Tree Save Area” signage to be placed around
the tree zone not more than every twenty (20) feet. Protective tree barriers
shall be installed to a minimum height of four (4) feet above ground level
around the outermost drip line of the tree protection zone, and the tree-
planting plan shall indicate the total number and species of trees to be
planted within a proposed development along with the intended location of same.
Trees required to be planted by this ordinance should be planted predominately
in the developed areas, driveway aisles, and/or parking areas of the project.
In no case shall more than fifty percent (50%) of the trees required to be
planted be utilized to satisfy the screening requirements of a development. The
exact location of the trees to be planted and the species shall be approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission, after review of the City Arborist's
recommendations, as part of the Stage I review process. Whenever the owner/
developer can demonstrate to the Planning and Zoning Commission that the site
spatial constraints result in an absolute inability to plant the required
number of trees. As many trees as possible shall be planted on the site.
Additional landscaping may be substituted for mandatory tree planting at the
discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The difference in the
monetary value of the number of trees required to be planted, and the number of
trees actually planted on the site shall be paid to the City's tree fund for
tree planting elsewhere in the City on public property. A reduction credit of
one (1) tree or more shall be granted to an owner/developer when either of the
following conditions exist:
      (a)   For every tree saved within the buildable area of a development,
eight (8) inches or more in diameter, or
      (b)   For every two (2) trees saved within the buildable area of a
development six (6) to eight (8) inches in diameter.
   3.    A landmark tree may not be removed without prior approval of the
Planning and Zoning Commission. If a landmark tree is irreparably damaged or
must be removed, it must be replaced with six (6) trees of 4" caliper with
location and species as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   4.   The following criteria shall apply for tree replacement for each zoning
district as outlined below:
      (a)   The following requirements shall apply for all tree planting plans
in conjunction with all development plans submitted for a development in a R-2,
R-3, R-4, or R-5 Zone.
Two (2) trees shall be planted on the development site for every one (1) unit
approved. Any tree planted relative to the requirements contained herein shall
not be less than two (2) inches in diameter as measured 12" above the ground
when planted.
      (b)   The following requirements shall apply for all tree planting plans
in conjunction with development plans submitted for a development in a RFD
Zone, CBDF Zone, CBD Zone, SC Zone NC Zone, PO Zone, 1-1 Zone or 1-2 Zone. One
(1) tree shall be planted on the development site for every five (5) required
parking spaces. Any tree planted relative to the requirements contained herein
shall be not less than three (3) inches in diameter as measured 12 inches above
the ground when planted.
      (c)   The following requirements shall apply for all tree-planting plans
in conjunction with new subdivision plans with multiple lots submitted for a
subdivision in R-l Zone and CO Zones. Two (2) trees shall be planted on each
lot for every five thousand (5,000) square feet of lot area or fraction
thereof. The tree(s) required to be planted on each lot may be planted on the
lot or on the public rights-of-way in front of each lot. Any tree planted
relative to the requirements contained herein shall not be less than two (2)
inches in diameter as measured 12 inches above the ground when planted.

to all other applicable federal, state, and local zoning codes, building codes
or permits.
      2.   NEW SMALL CELL SYSTEM TOWER LOCATIONS IN ALL ZONING DISTRICTS: The
regulations in this subsection apply to all new small cell system towers.
         a.   Temporary, mobile or wheeled cellular antenna towers shall not be
permitted.
         b.   New small cell towers shall not exceed the maximum building
height for the zoning district within which they are located. A height that is
in excess of what is permitted within the zoning district may be approved by
staff if it integrates stealth technology that better meets the objectives of
these regulations.
         c.   New small cell towers shall be designed and constructed to
accommodate a minimum of two (2) service providers.
         d.   New small cell towers may be located on public or private
nonresidential land or within a public rights-of-way provided it does not
interfere with other utilities, functionality of sidewalks, visibility, or
other matters of public safety.
         e.   New small cell towers shall not be illuminated, except in accord
with state or federal regulations, or unless illumination is integral to the
stealth technology, such as a design intended to look like a street light pole.
         f.   New small cell towers shall not include signage or advertisements
and may only display information required by a federal, state, or local agency.
Such display shall not exceed one (1) square foot in area, unless required by
state or federal regulations, or unless a larger display is integral to the
stealth technology. Such display shall not exceed the width of the pole, unless
a wider sign is integral to the stealth technology such as a design which
integrates a decorative banner.
         g.   If a new small cell tower is located in an area with primarily
underground utilities, or where no adjacent overhead utility lines exist, or
where a project for underground utilities is underway, it shall not utilize
overhead utility lines. It shall be required that in addition to all public
utilities, small cell tower system infrastructure, excepting the antenna, where
possible, shall be placed underground. This shall particularly apply to areas
of the City with planned improvements. In the areas with planned improvements,
where new small cell towers are proposed, they should be coordinated with other
public improvements (such as with streetlighting), that could employ stealth
technology.
         h.   In instances where an antenna is proposed to be constructed
within a historic or commercial district with established public or private
design control measures, regulations in subsection 3.4, C., shall be followed.
Efforts shall be made to adhere to any established design control measures or
existing furnishing or fixture styles within the district. Where additional
local design review processes exist, such as certificates of appropriateness or
urban design review boards, such approvals may be required.
      3.   NEW SMALL CELL SYSTEM TOWER LOCATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL ZONES: The
regulations in this subsection apply to small cell towers to be located within,
or immediately adjacent to, residential zoning districts.
         a.   Facilities in residential areas are strongly encouraged to be
non-tower wireless communication facilities, which are exempt from these
regulations.
         b.   New small cell towers and antenna or related equipment shall be
camouflaged by stealth technology. Examples of appropriate stealth technology
for residential areas includes, at a minimum, towers with all cables, wires,
transmission equipment, electric meters, power equipment, etc. installed inside
the small cell tower. Other types of stealth technology or other methods which
will reduce the visual impact may be approved by staff.
         c.   All poles and antennas shall be uniform grey or black in color,
unless another color is integral to the stealth technology as approved by
staff.
         d.   The use of cooling fans is discouraged. When needed, fans with
lower noise profiles must be used.
         e.   New small cell towers should avoid areas without overhead
utilities. If a small cell tower is located in an area with primarily
underground utilities it must adhere to stealth technology that incorporates
the telecommunications equipment into a streetscape amenity such as a
decorative lamp post, street light or other approved design. In areas with
overhead utilities, cylindrical antennas are required.
         f.   In residential areas, a small cell tower shall not be located
closer than the height of the proposed tower to an existing or proposed
residential structure, or no closer than thirty (30) feet, whichever is
greater.
         g.   Efforts should be made to locate new small cell towers in the
yard location where other overhead utilities are located.
         h.   New small cell towers within residential areas should be located
to avoid obstructing the view of building facades by placing the tower at a
corner, intersection or along a lot line.
         i.   New small cell tower shall not be located within five hundred
(500) Feet of an existing small cell system tower. Multiple carriers are
permitted and encouraged to locate on one tower, where possible.
         j.   Reasonable efforts shall be made to locate new small cell towers
in the order of hierarchy below, based on the following functional roadway
classification from the most to least preferred:
            (1)   Interstate;
            (2)   Arterial;
            (3)   Collector; or
            (4)   Local.
      4.   NEW SMALL CELL SYSTEM TOWER LOCATIONS IN NONRESIDENTIAL ZONES: The
regulations in this subsection apply to towers to be located within
nonresidential zoning districts.
         a.   In instances where a facility is proposed to be constructed in
the right-of- way within one hundred (100) feet of a residential zone or use,
even if the antenna's physical location is within a nonresidential zone,
regulations in subsection 3.4, C., shall be followed.
         b.   Antennas in commercial, institutional, or park areas are
encouraged to be installed as non-tower wireless communication facilities,
which are exempt from this regulation.
         c.   Reasonable effort shall be given to locate new equipment based
upon the following hierarchy of zones and land uses from the most to least
preferred:
            (1)   Co-locate on an existing structure whenever possible, which
is exempt from these regulations, per subsection J.1.
            (2)   Institutional;
            (3)   Industrial;
            (4)   Commercial;
            (5)   Public parks; and
            (6)   Agricultural.
         d.   Equipment enclosures, including electric meters, should be nearly
the same width as the pole or as small as possible. Ground mounted equipment
boxes should be screened from view with shrubs or other appropriate screening
as approved by staff.
         e.   Shrouds, risers, and conduits shall be used to reduce the
appearance of external cabling.
         f.   All poles, antennas, brackets, cabling, risers, shrouds, and
conduits shall be uniform grey or black in color, or other color as approved by
staff.
         g.   Cylindrical antennas shall be required, unless another antenna
style is integral to the stealth technology as approved by staff.
         h.   There shall be no more than a four (4) inch offset between the
pole and pole mounted equipment enclosures.
   K.   EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR CELLULAR ANTENNA TOWERS AND SMALL CELL TOWERS.
      1.   COMPREHENSIVE PLAN CONSIDERATION. Approval or disapproval of the
proposal shall be based upon an evaluation of the proposal’s agreement with the
comprehensive plan and zoning regulations.
      2.   CO-LOCATION CONSIDERATION.
         a.   The planning commission may require the applicant to make a
reasonable attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or related equipment.
The planning commission may provide the location of existing cellular antenna
towers on which the commission deems the applicant can successfully co-locate
its transmitting and related equipment. If the planning commission requires the
applicant to attempt co-location, the applicant shall provide the planning
commission with a statement indicating that the applicant has:
            (1)   Successfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to
host multiple wireless service providers’ facilities or existing structures
such as a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of
supporting the applicant’s facilities, and that identifies the location of the
tower or suitable structure on which the applicant will co-locate its
transmission and related facilities; or
            (2)   Unsuccessfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to
host multiple wireless service provider’s facilities or existing structures as
a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of supporting
the applicant’s facilities and that:
               (a)   Identifies the location of the towers or other structures
on which the applicant attempted to co-locate; and
               (b)   Lists the reasons why the co-location was unsuccessful in
each instance.
         b.   The planning commission may deny a uniform application to
construct a cellular antenna tower based on an applicant’s unwillingness to
attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or related equipment on any new or
existing towers or other structures.
         c.   The planning commission shall not regulate the placement of a
cellular antenna tower on the basis of the environmental effects of radio
frequency emissions to the extent that the proposed facility complies with the
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission concerning radio frequency
emissions.
      3.   AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS. The planning commission and staff shall
evaluate:
         a.   The extent to which the proposed facility is camouflaged (i.e.
use of stealth technology); and
         b.   The extent to which the proposed facility conforms to the
character of the surrounding area ( i.e., buildings, street lighting, signs).
   L.   AMENDMENTS. Any amendments to plans, except for minor adjustments as
determined by the planning commission, or its duly authorized representative,
shall be made in accordance with the procedure required herein, subject to the
same limitations and requirements as those under which such plans were
originally approved.

promote flexibility in design and permit planned diversification to the
relationships between location of and types of uses and structures; promote the
advantages of modern, large-scale site planning for community development
through the efficient use of land, facilitating a more economic arrangement of
buildings, circulation systems, land uses, and utilities; preserve, to the
greatest extent possible, the existing landscape features and amenities and to
utilize such features in a harmonious fashion; providing for more usable and
suitably located recreation facilities, and other public and common facilities
than would otherwise be provided under conventional land development
procedures, but always with the intention of furthering the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
B.   ZONES PERMITTING TRANSITION ZONE DEVELOPMENT: A transition zone
development may be permitted in any zone where it is listed as “permitted
principal use,” provided, solely with respect to a new development and/or

comparable conditions and by common good practice. The relationship of
buildings to each other, to the local street system, and to open space land
shall be consistent with the intent of this section.
   4.   INTENSITY OF LAND USE: Because land is used more efficiently in a TZD,
improved environmental quality can often be produced with a greater density of
development per gross acre than usually permitted in a traditionally zoned
district. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine in each case of
new development or facility expansions the appropriate land use and density for
projects or sections thereof.
      a.   Land use ratios of new development or facility expansions are to be
determined based on the approved preliminary development plan.
   5.   COMMON PROPERTY: Common property in a TZD is a parcel or parcels of
land, together with the improvements thereon, the use and enjoyment of which
are shared by the owners and occupants. When common property exists, the
ownership of such common property may be either public or private. When common
property exists, satisfactory arrangements shall be made for the improvement,
operation, and maintenance of such common property and facilities, including
private streets, drives, service and parking areas, and recreational and open
spaces. The landowner shall provide for and establish an organization for the
ownership and maintenance of any private common open space, and such
organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common open
space.
   6.   CONFLICT OF RESTRICTIONS: Wherever there is a conflict or difference

of a TZD. Appurtenances to these systems may be accepted.
   8.   STREETS: The design and designation of all streets, public or private,
shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission where necessary.
Because of the nature of a TZD and the intent of this section, the overall
shape and dimension of new street right-of-way shall be at the discretion of
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   9.   COMMERCIAL DESIGN: The plan of a new development project shall provide
for the integrated and harmonious design of buildings in commercial and
industrial area and such parcels shall be developed in park-like surrounds
utilizing landscaping and existing woodlands as buffers to screen lighting,
parking areas, loading areas, and other features from the adjoining and
surrounding residential areas.
   10.   Design guidelines for new developments shall be submitted to and
approved by the Design Review Board along with the preliminary development plan
approved by the Planning Commission.
D.   APPLICATION AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES: Whenever a TZD is proposed, before a
permit for the erection of a permanent building or building expansion(s) in
such TZD shall be granted, and, if applicable, before a subdivision plat of any
part thereof may be filed in the office of the Planning and Zoning Commission,

the sketch plan as it was approved in the conceptual plan proceedings. If the
preliminary plat plan is disapproved, the Planning and Zoning Commission’s
statement shall contain the reasons for such findings. In such a case the
Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend further study of the plat plan and
re-submission of the preliminary plat plan to the Planning and Zoning
Commission after it has been revised.
F.   PHASE III - FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND FINAL PLAT REQUIREMENTS:
   1.   APPLICATION FOR FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL: After receiving the
conditional approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission on a preliminary
plan and approval for all necessary permits and curb cuts from city and/or
state officials, the applicant may prepare his or her final Development Plan
and submit it to the Planning and Zoning Commission for final approval. The
Final Development Plan shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat plan
that has received conditional approval. It should incorporate any revisions or
other features that may have been recommended by the Planning and Zoning
Commission during concept plan and preliminary plat and review procedures.
   2.   FINAL PLATTING PROCEDURES: The elements of the final plat shall consist
of:
      a.   Plat or plats of the subject property drawn to a scale of not
greater than one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet, suitable for recording
and which will be recorded in the office of the County Clerk, after final
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The plat or plats shall conform
to the applicable requirements of the subdivision regulations, unless
specifically waived by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and in addition to
the following:
         (1)   All areas reserved for common ownership with an indication of
the properties the owners will share in common.
         (2)   Such lot or parcel lines indicting tracts, which are, now in
separate ownership or which may be transferred to other ownership during or
after development. (Resubdivision of large lots containing several buildings
may be accomplished at a later date upon application and approval);
         (3)   Indication of areas to be developed for residential (by type of
housing unit), commercial, public and semi-public uses.
      b.   In addition to and along with the final plat, the applicant shall
also submit a final development plan, at a scale of not greater than one (1)
inch equals one hundred (100) feet, which shall set forth, identify, and locate
the following:
         (1)   The proposed finished grade of the subject property shown by

necessary, by spot elevations;
         (2)   All walks, mats, and other open areas, including recreational
areas, swimming pools, golf courses, tennis courts, playgrounds, and the like.
         (3)   The location and type of all walls, fences, screen plantings,
and landscaping;
         (4)   The location, size, height, and orientation of all signs;
         (5)   The types of surfacing proposed on the various off-street
parking, and driveways including cross sections and drainage plans;
         (6)   Location and cross section drawings of all proposed streets,
highways, alleys, and walkways, indicating the proposed surfacing and drainage
plans;
         (7)   A plan showing all existing and proposed utilities, indicating,
where applicable, pipe sizes, types, and grades;
         (8)   A drainage plan of the natural and storm sewer system of the
area showing size and location of each existing and proposed structure, the
approximate volume of runoff water generated by development of the subject area
and the proposed method of disposing of said water. Provisions shall be
included for adequate control of erosion, hillside slippage, and sedimentation,
indicating the proposed temporary and permanent control practices and measures
which will be implemented during all phases of clearing, grading, and
construction.

suitable and convenient manner so long as the data required is clearly
indicated on one or more of said plans. A separate plan or drawing for each
element is not necessary, but may be provided at the option of the applicant.
         (10)   A final schedule of development staging and phasing as set
forth elsewhere in this chapter.
         (11)   Sketches of the exteriors of several representative buildings
in the project. It is intended that neither uniformity of architectural style
nor unnecessary diversity thereof be a prerequisite to approval, but the
developer is encouraged to exercise ingenuity in achieving a harmonious entity
without undue attention to consistency. The purpose of this subsection is to
permit development flexibility greater than that permitted by other sections of
this section.
      c.   The Final Development Plan: After approval by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, shall be delivered to the Zoning Administrator, who shall
grant permits only in accordance with the approved development plan and other
plans as required by this section.

Planning and Zoning Commission may, from time to time, modify the approved
final plat plan in a manner consistent with the approved preliminary plat plan
to allow for changed circumstances and conditions unforeseen at the time of the
original approval.
   3.   REQUEST FOR CHANGES: If in the development of the site, it becomes
apparent that certain elements of the plan are not feasible and in need of
significant modification, the applicant shall then present his or her solution
to the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
then determine whether or not the modified plan is still in keeping with the
intent of the Comprehensive Plan and zoning district with respect to the
specific property. If a negative decision is reached, the site plan shall be
considered as disapproved. The applicant may then produce another site plan
solution. If an affirmative decision is reached, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall so notify the Zoning Administrator, stating all of the
particulars of the matter and authorizing the modifications as approved.
   4.   EXPIRATION OF APPROVAL: Approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall expire after a period of five (5) years from the approval of the TZD’s
Development Plan unless the development is fifty-one percent (51%) completed in
terms of public improvements such as power, gas, water, and sanitary sewers, in
which latter instance an extension of time may be granted by the Planning and
Zoning Commission not to exceed five (5) successive periods of two (2) years
each.
   5.   RECORDING: All approved final plat plans and modifications thereof
shall be recorded in the appropriate plat books in the office of the County

      1.   R-1 RESIDENTIAL ONE ZONE: The R-1 Zone is intended to be limited to
dwellings and public or semi-public uses which are normally associated with
residential neighborhoods. The only uses permitted in this district are those,
which would not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood.
Conversion of existing structures should be discouraged. Densities in this area
should generally be below ten (10) units per acre. New residential developments
under this zone should however, be discouraged at densities above seven (7)
units per acre. The purpose of this district is to create an attractive, stable
and orderly single-family residential environment.
      2.   R-2H RESIDENTIAL TWO HILLSIDE ZONE: The R-2H Zone is intended to
stabilize and protect the urban residential character within areas of the
southern section of the city by permitting a higher density of single-family
residences. New development, redevelopment and rehabilitation in this zone

and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission or its duly authorized
representative. Densities range from approximately 10 to 17 units per acre.
      3.   R-2 RESIDENTIAL TWO ZONE:  The R-2 Zone is intended to stabilize and
protect the urban residential character within the older eastern section of the
City by permitting a mixture of single and two-family residences, and selective
types of existing neighborhood retail and service establishments as defined
herein. New development, redevelopment and rehabilitation in this zone should
mirror existing uses closely. Conversion of structures should be appropriate
only when the size of the structure and land surrounding it allow such
renovation. In fill development shall be submitted to and approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission or its duly authorized representative. Densities
range from approximately 10 to 17 units per acre.
      4.   R-3 RESIDENTIAL THREE ZONE:  The R-3 Zone is intended to stabilize

fill development shall be submitted to and approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or its duly authorized representative. Densities range from
approximately 12 to 21 units per acre.
      5.   R-4 RESIDENTIAL FOUR ZONE:  The R-4 Zone is intended to provide a
district within which medium density two family, three family and multi family
dwelling units are permissible along with public or semi-public uses which are
normally associated with residential neighborhoods. Density shall not exceed 10
units per acre.
      6.   R-5 RESIDENTIAL FIVE ZONE: The R-5 Zone is intended to provide a
district within which high-density multi family dwelling units are permissible.
This zone also allows a mixture of ancillary retail or office uses that would
compatibly serve the residential neighborhood created through this district.
New development would be encouraged as townhouses or apartment/condominiums on
in fill sites. Rehabilitation of existing larger structures (retail,
institutional and residential) would be encouraged as residential space. Single
family residential and large scale commercial development should be
discouraged. Densities shall not exceed 1 (one) unit per 2,178 square feet.

SECTION 10.3 COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
   A.   DISTRICT DEFINED:
      1.   Central Business District Zone - the CBD Zone is designed to permit
the development of a complete range of retail sales and personal, professional,
and business services required to meet the demands of a fully developed
community. In general, to achieve maximum flexibility of permitted land use,
the CBD Zone makes possible a highly varied grouping of retail and business
functions.
      2.   Neighborhood Commercial Zone - the NC Zone is created to provide for
local or neighborhood business uses that will be compatible with adjoining
residential areas. The NC Zone is designed to provide for commercial, office,
public and semi public structures, which are to be typically much less
commercial in appearance and architecturally more harmonious with residential
structures. This zone can serve as a buffer between residential areas and
general business districts (such as the CBD or Shopping Center Areas) where a
gradual transition from existing residential use to general business use is
occurring or should occur.
      3.   Shopping Center Zone - the SC Zone is designed to permit the
development of a complete range of retail sales and personal, professional, and
business services required to meet the demands of the community and larger
region. This zone provides for commercial uses that are compatible with the
existing commercial character of outlying highways and arterials.
      4.   Professional Office Zone - the PO Zone is designed to allow a "mix"
of business and professional office establishments with existing dwellings
along major thoroughfares that are undergoing a transition in use from
residential to higher intensity commercial and office uses. The purpose of this
Zone is to allow for extensive rehabilitation of residential structures for
business and professional office purposes.
      5.   Riverfront District - the RFD is designed to capitalize on proximity
of the Ohio River. A mixture of office and residential high-rise buildings
along with supporting retail establishments are to be encouraged in this
district. This district encompasses the area between 3rd Street and the
riverfront.
      6.   Central Business District Fringe - the CBDF District is designed as
a transitional zone that encourages appropriate conversion and adaptive reuse
of existing residential structures for mixed uses; including office,
residential and retail. This district encompasses the 11th Street corridor and
neighborhoods on the perimeter of the existing CBD.
   B.   PERMITTED USES:
      The permitted uses for each zone are shown in the following Table. Uses
listed for the six commercial zones shall be according to the common meaning of
the term or according to definitions given in this Ordinance. Uses not
specifically listed or defined herein shall not be permitted.

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR INDUSTRIAL ZONES
SECTION 11.0 APPLICATION OF PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
After the effective date of this Ordinance any use established or changed to,
and any building, structure or tract of land developed, constructed or used
for, any permitted or permissible principal or accessory use in the I 1 or I 2
zones shall comply with all of the performance standards herein set forth in
the district involved. If any existing use of any building or other structure
is extended, enlarged, or reconstructed, the performance standards for the
district involved shall apply with respect to such extended, enlarged or
reconstructed portion or portions of such use of any building or other
structure.
SECTION 11.1 EFFECTS OF CONCURRENT OPERATIONS:
The sum total of the effects of concurrent operations on two or more lots
should not be greater or more offensive to the senses than the standards
contained herein. Compliance with the provision of these performance standards
by single or mutual changes in operational levels, scheduling of operations,
and other adjustments is permitted.
   A.   BUILDING ENCLOSURES: Every use permitted in the I 1 Industrial District
shall be operated in its entirety within a completely enclosed building. In the
I 2 Industrial District, permitted uses shall be operated either within a
completely enclosed building or within an area enclosed on all sides by a solid
noncombustible fence or wall, as regulated by Article XII of this Ordinance;
provided further, that no goods, material or objects shall be stacked higher
than the fence or wall.
   B.   LANDSCAPING: In the I 1 or I 2 Districts, all required yards shall

for the Analysis of Noise and Other Sounds, Z24.10 1953, American Standards
Association, Inc., New York, New York, or the latest edition of such standards,
shall be used.) In the enforcement of the regulation, noises produced by the
operation of motor vehicles or other transportation facilities shall not be
included in determining the maximum permitted decibel level. In the I 1
District the sound pressure of noise radiated from any activity shall not
exceed the value given in Table 10 of this section, in any octave band
frequency at any point on or beyond any lot line.
      In the I 1 District the sound pressure of noise radiated from any
activity shall not exceed the values given in Table 11 of this section in any
octave band frequency at any point on or beyond any lot line. If the I 1
District adjoins a residential district the maximum sound pressure level at any
point on the district boundary shall be reduced by six (6) decibels from the
maximum listed in Table 10.
      In the I 2 District the sound pressure of noise radiated from any
activity shall not exceed the value given in Table 11 of this section in any
octave band frequency at any point on or beyond the nearest district boundary.
If an I 2 District adjoins a residential district, the maximum sound pressure
level starting point at the district boundary shall be reduced by six (6)
decibels from the maximum listed in Table 11 of this section.
      In the I 1, and I 2 Districts industrial noise shall be muffled so as not
to become objectionable due to intermittence, beat, frequency, or shrillness.

OFF STREET PARKING AND ACCESS CONTROL REGULATIONS
SECTION 13.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
In all zones, off street parking facilities for the storage or parking of motor
vehicles for use of occupants, employees, and patrons of the building hereafter
erected, altered, or extended, and all uses of the land after the effective
date of this ordinance, shall be provided and maintained as herein prescribed.
However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the date of adoption
of this ordinance and provided that construction has been begun within ninety
(90) consecutive calendar days of such effective date, off street parking
facilities in the amounts required by this ordinance shall prevail.
   Computation of Parking Spaces In determining the number of parking spaces
required, if such spaces result in fractional parts thereof, the number of said
spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest whole number.
   Additional Parking Spaces to be Provided Whenever the intensity of use of
any building, structure, or premises shall be increased through addition of
dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, change of use, or other
units of measurement specified herein, additional parking spaces shall be
provided in the amounts hereafter specified for that use, if the existing
parking space is inadequate to serve such increase in intensity of use.
SECTION 13.1 DISTRICT PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Residential Zones:
      1.   Single-Family Residential Zone (R-1) and (R-2H); and Single-Family
and Two-Family Residential Zones (R-2 and R-3): Off street parking may be
permitted in driveways in the front, side, and rear yards of permitted uses in
the R-1 and R-3 Zones and in the rear yard in the R-2 Zone, provided all
requirements of this ordinance are met. No off street parking area, located in
the front yard in a single family residential zone, may exceed 400 square feet
(two parking spaces) except, however, the zoning administrator may allow
additional off street parking spaces to be located thereon provided that the
additional parking spaces will not cause the ratio of unpaved area to paved
area (parking and driveway areas) in the front yard to be less than 3:1. Where
single or two family dwellings, which are permitted herein and are existing at
the time of adoption of this Ordinance, occupy a lot of such size that off
street parking could not be provided on the same lot or zoning lot as the use
being served, said off street parking may be permitted to locate within a
distance not to exceed three hundred (300) feet from said dwelling or dwellings
upon approval of the Zoning Administrator. In addition, said off street parking
lot shall be located in the same zone as the use being served and constructed
in accordance with SECTION 13.0 of this Ordinance. Off street parking as
required for conditional uses permitted in the Residential (R) Zones may be
permitted to locate on another site other than the same site as the
conditionally permitted use is located, when approved by the Board of
Adjustment, provided that said parking is located within reasonable walking
distance to the conditionally permitted use and available at all times,
exclusively for the use being served.
      2.   Multi Family Residential Zones:
         a.   R-2 and R-3 Districts: No off-street parking may be permitted in
front yards in this zone except for drive-ways connecting a rear parking area.
However, only the Board of Adjustments may, in its discretion, permit the ratio
of unpaved area to paved area (parking and drive-way area) to be less than a
three to one ration.
         b.   R-4 and R-5: Off street parking may be permitted in side or rear
yards of permitted uses in these zones, provided that off street parking
facilities shall be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from the rear lot line.
Off street parking may be permitted in required front yard, only if approved
according to an approved development plan.
         Multi-family dwellings existing at the time of adoption of this
Ordinance may supply off street parking within three hundred (300) feet from
such lot or zoning lot served upon approval of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, providing that such off street parking is located within the same
zone as the establishment being served and that off street parking requirements
of this Ordinance are complied with at all times. Further, the applicant must
also show sufficient proof that such off street parking facilities would be
impossible to provide the required off street parking space, as required
herein, on the same lot or zoning lot or contiguous to the same lot or zoning
lot as the building being served.
   B.   Special Development Zones (CO, PUD, and CCO) off street parking shall
be located as designated on the approved development plan.
   C.   Commercial and Industrial Zones: (CBD, SC, NC, PO, CBDF, RFD, I-1 and
I-2): All off street parking facilities shall be located on the same lot or
zoning lot as the building served except for the following:
      Off street parking facilities for uses permitted in the CBD, RFD, PO, MC
and CBDF Zone may be located on another zoning lot than the building or use
being served is located providing such off street parking requirements of this
Ordinance are complied with at all times. Off street parking shall be provided
within six hundred and fifty (650) feet of the building or use for which the
parking is provided. Any use permitted in an industrial zone may supply off
street parking on the same lot or zoning lot, or within three hundred (300)
feet from such lot or zoning lot served upon approval of the Planning and
Zoning Commission, providing that such off street parking is located within the
same zone as the establishment being served and that off street parking
requirements of this Ordinance are complied with at all times. Further, the
applicant must also show sufficient proof that such off street parking space
would be impossible to provide, as required herein, on the same lot or zoning
lot or contiguous to the same lot or zoning lot as the building being served.
   D.   Other Requirements
      1.   Collective Parking Provision Collective off street parking
facilities shall not be less than would otherwise be individually required.
      2.   Driveways Not Computed As Part of Required Parking Area Entrances,
exits, or driveways shall not be computed as any part of a required parking lot
or area, except in the case of single family residential zones, where access
driveways may be used for parking.
      3.   Off Street Parking Space To Be Used For Parking only any vehicle
parking space shall be used for parking only. Any other use of such space,
including repair work or servicing of any kind other than in an emergency, or
the requirement of any payment for the use of such space, shall be deemed to
constitute a separate commercial use in violation of the provisions of this
ordinance.
      4.   No Building To Be Erected in Off Street Parking Space No building of
any kind shall be erected in any off street lot except a parking garage
containing parking spaces equal to the requirements set forth in this section
of the ordinance or a shelter house booth for parking attendant providing the
number of spaces required are not reduced.
      5.   Parking Plan Approval Required Plans for all parking lot facilities,
including parking garages, shall be submitted to the zoning administrator for
review and for compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and such other
pertinent ordinances of the City. Such plans shall show the number of spaces
and arrangements of parking aisles, location of access points onto adjacent
streets, provisions for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, location of
sidewalks and curbs on or adjacent to the property, utilities, location of
shelters for parking attendant, locations of signs, typical cross sections of
pavement, including base and sub base; (in accordance with Appendix A attached
hereto and made part of this Ordinance by reference) and proposed grade of
parking lot, storm drainage facilities, location and type of lighting
facilities and such other information or plans as the circumstances may
warrant. Where such parking plans include provisions for access points to
adjacent streets, then said plan shall also be prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Section 13.3.
(Am. Ord. O-04-05, passed 5-17-2004)
SECTION 13.2 DESIGN AND LAYOUT OF OFF STREET PARKING AREAS:
   A.   Size of Off Street Parking Spaces for the purposes of this ordinance,
one (1) parking space shall be a minimum of nine (9) feet in width and eighteen
(18) feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles. Such parking space
shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven (7) feet.
   B.   Width of Access Drives all off street parking areas shall be laid out
with the following minimum aisle or access drive widths:
      1.   Ninety (90) degree (perpendicular) parking Twenty-five (25) feet
(either one or two way circulation).
      2.   Sixty (60) degree (angle) parking Fifteen (15) feet (one-way
circulation only).
      3.   Forty five (45) degree (angle) parking Twelve (12) feet (one-way

circulation only).
      5.   Zero (0) degree (parallel) parking Twelve (12) feet (one-way
circulation).
      When any combination of these types of parking is used (facing the same
aisle) the most restricted aisle or access drive width requirements shall
prevail). In addition, a two-foot overhang may be permitted on the external
sides of a parking area. If the width of the parking space is increased (over 9
feet), the drive aisle width can be decreased proportionally (2 foot width in
drive aisle per 1 foot increase in space width) except that a drive aisle for 2
way traffic may not be decreased below 20 feet in width and a drive aisle for 1
way traffic may not be decreased below 11 feet in width.
   C.   Access to Off Street Parking Spaces Each required parking space shall
be connected with a deeded public right of way by means of aisles or access
drives as required by SECTION 13.2(B). The parking area shall be so designed as
to ensure that all maneuvering into and out of each parking space shall take
place entirely within property lines of lots, garages and/or storage areas. All
driveways are to be paved or asphalt.
   D.   Off Street Parking Areas in Multi Family, Commercial, or Industrial
Zones All such parking areas shall have a protective wall and/or bumper blocks
around the perimeter of said parking area and shall be so designed that all
vehicles leaving the facility will be traveling forward to approaching traffic.
All parking shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on
any property situated in a zone permitting single family residential
development, by a solid wall, fence, or densely planted compact hedge as
regulated by SECTION 9.16 of this ordinance. Ground cover shrubs and trees
shall be located and maintained so as to not interfere with vehicular and
pedestrian traffic on the property or with sign distance clearance at entrances
and exits.
   E.   Lighting any lighting used to illuminate off street parking areas shall
not glare upon any right of way or adjacent property.
   F.   Paving of New Off Street Parking Area All new off street parking areas
shall be paved with asphalt concrete or concrete and shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with Appendix A attached hereto and made part of this
Ordinance by reference, or other suitable surface approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
SECTION 13.3 SPECIFIC OFF STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
The amount of off street parking space required for uses, building, or
additions and changes in intensity of uses thereto shall be determined
according to the following requirements, and the space, so required, shall be
stated in the application for a zoning and building permit and shall be
reserved for such use. Where more than one use is located in the same building,
each individual use shall be in accordance with the off street parking
requirements of this section of the ordinance.

SECTION 13.4 ACCESS CONTROL REGULATIONS
In order to promote greater safety of passage between highway and land; improve
the convenience and ease of movement of travelers on the highway; permit
reasonable speeds and economy of travel; and increase and protect the capacity
of the highway, the location and design of access points shall be in accordance
with the following access control requirements. These requirements shall apply
to all arterial and collector type streets, as identified in the adopted
comprehensive plan:
   A.   Coordination of Access Points: Major access points on opposite side of
the arterial and collector streets shall be located opposite each other,
otherwise turning movement restrictions may be imposed by the Planning and
Zoning Commission or Zoning Administrator, whichever is applicable. In
addition, in order to maximize the efficient utilization of access points, and
make possible the coordination of access with and between adjacent properties
developed (present or future) for similar uses. As a condition of approval for
construction, use, or reuse of any access road, the zoning administrator may
require that unobstructed and unencumbered access, in accordance with the
provisions of this ordinance, be provided from any such access point to
adjacent properties.
   B.   Spacing Restrictions for Signalized Access Points: Access points which
will warrant signalization shall be spaced a minimum distance of one quarter
mile apart. The exact location of the signal light shall be determined by a
traffic engineering study, which shall at least account for the following
variables:
      1.   Speed;
      2.   Traffic signal phasing;
      3.   Traffic signal cycle length;
      4.   Roadway geometrics; and
      5.   Accident experience.
      Provision for all turning movements to maintain the design capacity of
the roadway shall be required.
   C.   Sight Distance: The location of access points shall comply with safe
sight distance requirements as provided in Table 13. The centerline of all
access points shall intersect as nearly at a ninety (90) degree angle as
possible but in no case shall the angle of intersection be less than seventy
five (75) degrees or greater than one hundred five (105) degrees, unless
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission or Zoning Administrator,
whichever is applicable, due to certain exceptional conditions.
   D.   Location of Unsignalized Access Points:
      1.   Unsignalized access points shall be spaced a minimum distance of two
hundred (200) feet apart. Turning restriction may be required.
      2.   Two access points per 400 feet of street frontage will be permitted;
however, if the spacing requirements for a direct access point onto an arterial
street (as provided in D, 1, above) cannot be met, then an access point may be
located on a frontage road or on an intersection local street, or share a
common driveway that meets the spacing requirements. In order for the
intersecting local street or frontage road to function properly, access onto
them should be controlled as follows:
         (a)   Access points onto local streets, intersections, and arterial
street shall be spaced a minimum distance of fifty (50) feet, measured from
point of curb return to point of curb return, from arterial street.
         (b)   In areas zoned to permit commercial, industrial, or multi family
residential use, access points from adjacent properties onto frontage roads,
shall be no less than fifty (50) feet measured from point of curb return to
point of curb return from intersections of the frontage road with local or
collector streets.
         (c)   If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the
requirements of this section of the ordinance, one access point shall be
provided. However, all such access points shall be considered a temporary right
of way and may be terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning movements or
caused to be relocated by the zoning administrator at such time as the
particular use served by the access point changes and/or the property is
otherwise provided an alternate means of access via a frontage road or an
intersection, local street, or sharing of a common driveway. Provisions for the
construction of a frontage road, restricted turning movements, or other
improvements, may be required, as a condition to approval, in order to minimize
the number of access points and congestion to the adjacent street. In all cases
where said access points are classified as "temporary", such designation shall
be duly noted on the plot plan or site plan submitted for a zoning permit and
also upon the deed of the property in question.
   E.   Width of Access Points:
      1.   In residential zones, no access point width shall be less than nine
(9) feet, nor more than twenty (20) feet. In all other zones, access points
shall not be less than twelve (12) feet, nor more than forty eight (48) feet in
width. The width shall be as measured from the point of curb return to point of
curb return (or edge of pavement if no curb exists) excluding the curb radius.
      2.   The zoning administrator may modify (enlarge or reduce) the width to
provide for a more efficient and safe channelization and/or flow of traffic.
   F.   Exceptions to Access Points Requirements: Where situations develop that
may require special treatment, the requirements as provided in Section 13.3, A
G, may be varied by the Planning and Zoning Commission provided that a traffic
engineering report is prepared by a qualified traffic engineer, establishing
that the special treatment will have no adverse effects on the roadway safety
and capacity.
   G.   Access Point Problem Areas: If after special study, it is determined
that the type of use or activity proposed would have an adverse effect on the
safety and capacity of the adjacent roadway, the access point spacing
requirements as contained in this section, may have to be increased in order to
adequately solve the traffic movement.
   H.   Approval of Access Points and Curb Cuts Required: As regulated by
SECTION 9.19 of this Ordinance, Plans for all access points and modifications
thereto, (including plans to use existing access points and where a change of
use for any tract of land would generate more traffic than the previous use)
shall be submitted to the zoning administrator at a scale not less than 1 inch
= 100 feet. Such plans shall show the location of all access points, and access
points within 600 feet in either direction. The proposed access point shall
include typical cross sections of pavement, the base and subbase, proposed
grade and storm drainage and such other information or plans as the
circumstances may warrant. If such access points are being located in
conjunction with off street parking and/or loading and unloading facilities,
then said plans shall also include parking and off street loading and/or
unloading plans, in accordance with SECTIONS 13.0 and 14.0 of this Ordinance.
   I.   Approval of Access Points Along State Maintained Routes by Kentucky
Department of Transportation: A copy of the plan for all access points to be
constructed along a state maintained route shall also be submitted to the
Kentucky Department of Transportation for review and approval during the same
time as plans are submitted to the zoning administrator, as provided for in
Section 13.4. No access point plans shall be approved or permits issued for
construction by the zoning administrator, until said access point plans have
been approved by the Kentucky Department of Transportation.
SECTION 13.5 VARIANCES
The foregoing subsections of Article XIII shall be subject to the same
provisions regarding variances there from as provided by all the provisions
regarding Sections 18.6 and 18.7 of this Ordinance.

Values are for urban conditions. On rural streets, distances are to be
increased by 10 Percent to allow for longer drive reaction time. The sight
distances apply when street grades are zero to 3.0 percent (either up or down).
When an upgrade is steeper than 3.0 percent, adjustments are to made to
compensate for the longer time required to reach the speed of highway traffic.
The time is less than shown when the highway is descending. Adjustment factors
below apply to grades only in that portion of the road between the access
points and the downstream point at which a vehicle emerging from the access
points has been able to accelerate to within ten miles per hour of the route
speed. When the street, in the section to be used for acceleration after
leaving the access point, ascends at 3 to 4 percent, then sight distances in
the direction of approaching ascending traffic are to be increased by a factor
of 4.1. When the access point ascends at 5 to 6 percent, sight distance should
be increased by a factor of 1.7. When the road in the section to be used for
acceleration after leaving the access point descends at 3 to 4 percent, sight
distance in the direction of approaching descending highway traffic should be
reduced by a factor of 0.6. If the road descends at 5 to 6 percent, sight
distance should be reduced by a factor of 0.5. When the criteria for sight
distances to the right cannot be met, the need can be eliminated by prohibiting
left turns by exiting vehicles.

Commission, or its duly authorized representative so directs.
2.   Soil Cement Base Course (with Asphalt Concrete Surface):
   a.   Description - soil cement base course shall consist of soil and cement
uniformly mixed, moistened, compacted, finished and cured in accordance with
the specifications herein, and it shall conform to the lines, grades,
thicknesses and typical cross section shown on the plans.
   b.   Materials:
      (1)   Cement - cement shall comply with the latest specifications for
cement, AASHO M85, M134, M151; or ASTM C150, C175, C205; or Federal SS C 192b,
SS C 218 for the type specified. One (1) cubic foot of portland cement shall be
considered to weight 94 lb. or 1 bbl. of cement shall be considered to weigh
376 lb.
      (2)   Water - water shall be free from substances deleterious to the
hardening of the soil cement.
      (3)   Soil - soil shall consist of the material existing in the area to
be paved, of approved selected soil, or of a combination of these materials
proportioned as directed. The soil shall not contain gravel or stone retained
on a three (3) inch sieve.
   c.   Construction Methods:
      (1)   Preparation - unsuitable soil or material shall be removed and
replaced with acceptable soil. The subgrade shall be firm so as to support,
without displacement, the construction equipment and the compaction hereinafter
specified. Soft or yielding subgrade shall be corrected and made stable, before
construction proceeds.
      (2)   Pulverization - the soil shall be so pulverized that, at the
completion of moist mixing, 100 percent by dry weight passes a one inch (1")
sieve, and a minimum of 80 percent passes a No. 4 sieve, exclusive of gravel or
stone retained on these sieves.
      (3)   Cement Application, Mixing and Spreading - mixing of the soil,
cement, and water shall be accomplished either by the mixed in place or the
central plant mixed method.    No cement or soil cement mixture shall be spread
when the soil or subgrade is frozen or when the air temperature is less than 40
degrees F. in the shade. The percentage of moisture in the soil, at the time of
cement application, shall not exceed the quantity that will permit a uniform
and intimate mixture of soil and cement during mixing operations, and it shall
not exceed the specified optimum moisture content for the soil cement mixture.
Any soil and cement mixture that has not been compacted and finished shall not
remain undisturbed for more than 30 minutes. The soil cement base course shall
have a thickness of not less than six (6) inches.
      (4)   Compaction - at the start of compaction, the percentage of moisture
in the mixture and in unpulverized soil lumps, based on oven dry weights, shall
not be below or more than two (2) percentage points above the specified optimum
moisture content, and shall be less than that quantity which will cause the
soil cement mixture to become unstable during compaction and finishing. The
specified optimum moisture content and density shall be determined in the field
by a moisture density test, AASHO T 34 57 or ASTM D558 57, on representative
samples of soil cement mixture obtained from the area being processed. Prior to
the beginning of compaction, the mixture shall be in a loose condition for its
full depth. The loose mixture then shall be uniformly compacted to the
specified density within two (2) hours. During compaction operations, shaping
may be required to obtain uniform compaction and required grade and cross
section.
      (5)   Finishing - after compaction the surface of the soil cement shall
be shaped to the required lines, grades and cross section. If necessary, during
shaping operations, the surface of the base shall be lightly scarified to
remove any tire imprints or smooth surfaces left by equipment. The resulting
surface shall then be compacted to the specified density. Rolling shall be
supplemented by broom dragging if required. The moisture content of the surface
material must be maintained at not less than its specified optimum moisture
content during finishing operations. Surface compaction and finishing shall be
done in such a manner as to produce, in not longer than two (2) hours, a
smooth, dense surface free of compaction plans, cracks, ridges or loose
material. Any portion of the soil cement that has a density of five (5) lb. or
more below that specified shall be corrected or replaced to meet these
specifications.
      (6)   Curing - after the soil cement has been finished as specified
herein, it shall be protected against drying for seven (7) days by the
application of bituminous material. The curing material shall be applied as
soon as possible but not later than twenty four (24) hours after the completion
of finishing operations. The finished soil cement shall be kept continuously
moist until the curing material is placed. The bituminous material specified
shall be uniformly applied to the surface of the completed soil cement at the
rate of approximately 0.2 gallon per square yard with approved heating and
distributing equipment. At the time the bituminous material is applied the soil
cement surface shall be dense, shall be free of all loose and extraneous
material, and shall contain sufficient moisture to prevent penetration of the
bituminous materials. Water shall be applied in sufficient quantity to fill the
surface voids of the soil cement immediately before the bituminous curing
material is applied. The curing material shall be maintained by the contractor
during the seven (7) day protection period so that all of the soil cement will
be covered effectively during this period. Sufficient protection from freezing
shall be given the soil cement for seven (7) days after its construction and
until it has hardened.
      (7)   Surfacing- asphaltic concrete shall be applied to the soil cement
base course as regulated in SECTION 1.(b)(3) of this Appendix.
3.   Concrete Parking Areas:
   (a)   General Requirements thickness of concrete parking shall be:
      (1)   A minimum of six (6) inches for passenger cars and panel or pick up
truck parking.
      (2)   A minimum of six (6) inches for driveways accommodating light
trucks and for light truck parking.
      (3)   A minimum of seven (7) inches for heavier commercial or industrial
needs.
   (b)   General Requirements concrete mix shall be:
      (1)   Minimum cement content 4,000 psi air entrained concrete.

required by the regulations herein. However, where a building permit has been
issued prior to the date of the adoption of this Ordinance, and provided that

least one (1) loading and/or unloading space. One (1) additional loading and/or
unloading space shall be provided for every additional ten thousand (10,000)
square feet, or fraction thereof, of gross floor area in the building. If
sufficient proof can be shown that less than these requirements (only that part
which has to do with over five thousand (5,000) square feet) will be
satisfactory for the operation in question, the Zoning Administrator may reduce
these requirements.
   B.   SIZE OF OFF STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING SPACE: Each off street
loading and/or unloading space shall be at least twelve (12) feet in width and
at least sixty (60) feet in length, exclusive of aisle and maneuvering spaces

of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street, road, highway or deeded
rights of way.
   E.   ENLARGEMENT OF BUILDING: The off street loading and/or unloading
requirements, as listed in this article of the ordinance, shall apply at the
time any building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding floor area.

SECTION 16.10 INTENT CONCERNING DETERMINATIONS INVOLVED IN ADMINISTRATION AND

designated City employees, at the request of the Zoning Administrator, using
equipment normally available to the City such investigation shall be so made
before notice of violation is issued.
   B.   Where technical complexity, nonavailability of equipment, or
extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable, in the opinion of the Zoning
Administrator for the City to maintain the personnel or equipment necessary for
making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures shall be established
for:
      1.   Causing corrections in apparent violations of performance standards;
      2.   Protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable
administration and enforcement of performance standard regulations; and
      3.   Protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for
administration and enforcement.
   C.   If the Zoning Administrator finds, after investigations have been made
by qualified experts, that there is a violation of the performance standards,
he shall take or cause to be taken lawful action to cause correction to within
limits set by such performance standards.
SECTION 16.11 DUTIES OF ZONING ADMINISTRATOR REGARDING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
If, in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, there is probable violation of
the performance standards as set forth, the following procedures shall be
followed:
   A.   The Zoning Administrator shall give written notice, by registered mail
or certified mail, to the person or persons responsible for the alleged
violation. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation
and the reasons why the Zoning Administrator believes there is a violation in
fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator within thirty (30) consecutive
calendar days of receipt of such notification. However, the following alleged
violations shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violations to
the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator within five (5) consecutive
calendar days from the receipt of such notification by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer:
      1.   Banners and temporary signs (Section 15.2).
      2.   Parking on off-street unpaved surfaces (Section 13.0).
      3.   Parking or storing of trailers, mobile homes, campers, inoperable
vehicles, and other such type equipment (Section 9.25).

violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator within thirty (30)
consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice constitutes admission of
violation of the terms of this Ordinance.
   B.   If there is no reply within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days (or
five consecutive calendar days as applicable) of receipt of said notice, but
the alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator, he shall note "violation corrected" on his copy of the notice,
and shall retain it among his official records, taking such other action as may
be warranted.
   C.   If there is no reply within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days (or
five consecutive calendar days as applicable) of receipt of said notice and the
alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator within the established time limit, he shall proceed to take or
cause to be taken such action as is warranted by continuation of a violation
after notice to cease.
   D.   If a reply is received within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days (or
five consecutive calendar days as applicable) of receipt of said notice
indicating that the alleged violation will be corrected to the satisfaction of
the Zoning Administrator, but requesting additional time, the Zoning
Administrator may grant a reasonable extension of time if (in) he deems it
warranted under the particular circumstances of the case and (to) if the
extension will not, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life, health or
property.
   E.   If a reply is received within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days (or
five consecutive calendar days as applicable) of receipt of said notice
requesting a technical determination of the alleged violations, and if the
alleged violations continue, the Zoning Administrator may call in properly
qualified expert to investigate and determine whether the violation exists or
may advise the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation that
they may retain qualified experts, at their own expense, to investigate and
determine whether the violations exist.
      The findings of the experts, if any, shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator to determine, in his opinion, whether there are violations based
upon the findings presented to him. If the findings indicate violations of the
performance standards, the persons responsible for the violations shall be
notified by the Zoning Administrator and may be subject to the penalties as may
be appropriate under the terms of Section 16.9 of this Ordinance. If the Zoning
Administrator determines that no violation exists, the person or persons shall
be promptly notified by the Zoning Administrator that no violations exist.
   F.   If a reply is received within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of
receipt of said notice requesting technical determination as provided in this
Ordinance, and if the alleged violations continue, the Zoning Administrator
shall call in properly qualified experts to investigate and determine whether
violations exist. If expert findings indicate violations of the performance
standards, the costs of the investigations shall be assessed against the
properties or persons responsible for the violations in addition to such other
penalties as may be appropriate under the terms of SECTION 16.9 of this
Ordinance. If no violation is found, the costs of the investigations shall be
paid by the City without assessment against the properties or persons involved.

An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken, certifies to the
Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be

SECTION 18.5 POWERS OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT:
Upon initial applications or appeals from decisions of the Code Enforcement
Director, the Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
   A.   To hear and decide on applications for dimensional variances where, by
reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or unusually shape of a site
on the effective date of this Ordinance, or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions, or some other extra ordinary situation or condition of
that site, the literal enforcement of the dimensional requirements (height or
width of building or size of yards, but not population density) of the zoning
ordinance would deprive the applicant of reasonable capacity to make use of the
land.
   B.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged, by the appellant, that
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by
a Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this Ordinance. Such appeal shall
be taken within sixty (60) consecutive calendar days.
   C.   To hear and decide applications for conditional use permits to allow
the proper integration into the community of uses which are specifically named
herein which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone only if
certain conditions are met as specified in SECTION
9.13 of this Ordinance.
   D.   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance, requests for interpretation of the Official Zoning Map or for
decisions upon other special questions upon which said Board is authorized to
act upon.
   E.   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance
and the adopted Comprehensive plan for the City of Newport, requests for the
change from one nonconforming use to another.
(Am. Ord. O-2019-006-A, passed 3-25-2019)
SECTION 18.6 DIMENSIONAL VARIANCES; CHANGE FROM ONE NONCONFORMING USE TO
ANOTHER; CONDITIONS GOVERNING APPLICATIONS; PROCEDURES:
   A.   DIMENSIONAL VARIANCES: Before any dimensional variance is granted, the
Board of Adjustment must find all of the following, which shall be recorded
along with any imposed conditions or restrictions in its minutes and records
and issued in written form to the applicant to constitute proof of the
dimensional variance. Such dimensional variance shall not be granted by the
Board of Adjustment unless and until:
      1.   A written application for a dimensional variance (including the
required fee as per SECTION 19.0 of this Ordinance) is submitted demonstrating:
         a.   That specific conditions and circumstances exist which are unique
to the applicant's land and do not exist on other land in the same zone.
         b.   That the manner in which the strict application of the provisions
of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land
in the manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same
zone.
         c.   That the unique conditions and circumstances are not the result
of actions of the applicant taken subsequently to the adoption of this
Ordinance.
         d.   Reasons that the dimensional variance will preserve, not harm the
public safety and welfare, and will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood.
         e.   That granting the dimensional variance requested will not confer
on the applicant any special privilege that is not conferred by this Ordinance
to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zone. No nonconforming use
of neighboring lands and structures in the same zone shall be considered
grounds for the issuance of a dimensional variance.
      2.   Notice of public hearing shall be given at least fourteen (14) days
in advance of the hearing by first class and certified mail to each owner of
record of every parcel of property adjoining the property to which the
dimensional variance is requested. It shall be the duty of the person or
persons proposing the dimensional variance to furnish to the Zoning
Administrator the names, property, and mailing addresses of the owners of all
adjoining property. Where property adjoins a street or alley, property abutting
the opposite side of such street or alley shall be considered adjoining
property. Records maintained by the Property Valuation Administrator shall be
relied upon to conclusively determine the identity, property, and mailing
address of the owner. If the property is in condominium or cooperative forms of
ownership, the person notified by mail shall be the president or chairman of
the owner group, which administers property commonly, owned by the condominium
or cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two (2) or more co-
owners of an adjoining property who are listed in the Property Valuation
Administrator’s records as having the same address.
      3.   The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in person,
or by agent or by attorney.
      4.   Prior to granting a dimensional variance;
         a.   The Board of Adjustments shall further make the following
findings when granting a dimensional variance:
            (1)   The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this Ordinance as well as the adopted
Comprehensive Plan for the City of Newport.
            (2)   It will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise,
detrimental to the public welfare.
            (3)   It will not adversely effect the public health, safety, or
welfare.
            (4)   It will not alter the essential character of the general
vicinity.
            (5)   It will not cause a hazard or nuisance to the public.
            (6)   It will not allow an unreasonable circumvention of the
requirements of the zoning regulations.
         b.   In granting any dimensional variance, the Board of Adjustment may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the dimensional variance is granted.
   B.   DIMENSIONAL VARIANCE CANNOT CONTRADICT ZONING REGULATION; The Board of
Adjustment shall not possess the power to grant a dimensional variance to
permit a use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by this
Ordinance in the zone in question, or to alter density requirements in the zone
in question.
   C.   DIMENSIONAL VARIANCE RUNS WITH LAND: A dimensional variance applies to
the property for which it is granted and not to the individual who applied for
it. A dimensional variance also runs with the land and is transferable to any
future owner of land, but it cannot be transferred by the applicant to a
different site.
   D.   CHANGE FROM ONE NONCONFORMING USE TO ANOTHER: No change from one
nonconforming use to another will be granted by the Board of adjustment unless
and until:
      1.   A written application for a change from one nonconforming use to
another (including the required fee as per SECTION 19.0 of this Ordinance) is
submitted to the Board demonstrating the following:
         a.   Reasons that the proposed change will preserve, not harm the
public safety and welfare and will not injure the essential character of the
neighborhood.
         b.   The proposed nonconforming use will be more in conformance with
the Adopted Comprehensive plan for the City of Newport as it applies to the
area in question, than the existing nonconforming use, and also more in
conformance to the type of uses permitted in the zone in question, as per this
Ordinance, than the present existing nonconforming use.
      2.   Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with SECTION
18.2 of this Ordinance.
      3.   The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in person,
or by agent or by attorney.
      4.   Prior to granting a change from one nonconforming use to another,
the Board of Adjustment shall make findings that the requirements of this and
other applicable sections of this Ordinance have been met by the applicant.
(Am. Ord. O-2016-024, passed 12-12-16)
SECTION 18.7 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT:
   A.   In exercising the aforementioned powers, the Board of Adjustments may,
so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this Ordinance,
reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements,
decision, or determination as made by the Zoning Administrator, from whom the
appeal is taken.
   B.   A simple majority of the quorum of the Board of adjustment as
established by regulation or agreement, shall be necessary to reverse any
order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator, or
to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to
pass under this Ordinance, or to effect any variation in the application of
this Ordinance.
   C.   The details of the decision of the Board shall be forwarded to the
Zoning Administrator.
(Am. Ord. O-2024-03, passed 3-25-2024)
SECTION 18.8 DECISIONS OF THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   Upon petition by an applicant, the Zoning Administrator may waive or
modify the standards governing the placement of certain appurtenant structures
within a residential property.
   B.    For the purposes of this section, appurtenant structures shall be
limited to swimming pools, porches, decks, utility sheds (smaller than 100
square feet), and single story garages located in the rear yard.
   C.   Applicants shall request such consideration in writing, stating the
nature of the request and reasons for the need for a modification or waiver.
   D.   All decisions of the Zoning Administrator shall be rendered, in
writing, within ten (10) working days of receipt of a petition.
   E.   The Zoning Administrator, at his/her discretion, may refer a petition
to the Board of Adjustments for action without recommendation.
   F.   The Zoning Administrator shall have discretion with regard to
determination if an application to the Board of Adjustment for a dimensional
variance qualifies as a small project. Small projects typically include
circumstances where the Board of Adjustment application fee exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the total cost of the project.

SECTION 20.0 DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this Article, the following terms are defined as follows:
FAIR HOUSING LAWS. The Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHA) and
the provisions of KRS 344.600 et seq., as may be amended from time to time
(fair housing laws).
GROUP HOME. A residential facility for the care of seven (7) or less unrelated
individuals living in a single housekeeping unit and recognized as handicapped
individuals under the Fair Housing Act and American with Disabilities Act. A
Sober Living Facility shall be considered as a Group Home for all purposes
consistent herewith.
HANDICAPPED. Person with Disabilities: For the purpose herein, has the meaning
set forth in the federal Fair Housing Act and the American with Disabilities
Act and is an individual who has a physical or mental impairment that limits
one or more of the major life activities of such individual, is regarding as
having such impairment, or has a record of such impairment. While a person

controlled substance is not.
OPERATOR. An individual or business entity, whether for profit or non-profit,
which provides residential services at a group home.
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. The act of making a dwelling unit or housing facility
(ies) readily accessible to and usable by a person with disabilities, through
the removal of constraints in the city’s land use, zoning, permit and
processing procedures. All accommodations may not be reasonable, and the
reasonableness of a request will be determined by the City.
SOBER LIVING FACILITY. A single family dwelling unit used by individuals
recovering from a drug and/or alcohol addiction, considered as a handicapped
individual under state or federal law. A sober living facility shall not

management services; legal services; vocational services; and other similar
supportive services.
(Am. Ord. O-2017-003, passed 1-23-2017)
SECTION 20.1 PURPOSE:

make reasonable accommodation in their land use and zoning regulations and
practices when such accommodation may be necessary to afford handicapped
individuals an equal opportunity to housing in accordance therewith.
   B.   In furtherance of the purposes of the fair housing laws, this article
is intended to: preserve the residential character of single family residential
neighborhoods; ensure that group homes, including sober living facilities, are
actually entitled to reasonable accommodation; limit the secondary impacts of
group homes including sober living facilities by reducing noise and traffic;
preserve safety and provide adequate on-street parking; provide an
accommodation for handicapped individuals that is reasonable and actually bears
some resemblance to the opportunities afforded non-handicapped individuals to
use and enjoy a dwelling in a residential neighborhood; and, to provide a
living environment that will enhance the opportunity for the handicapped to be
successful in their programs. Pursuant to fair housing laws, this article is
also created to provide handicapped individuals reasonable accommodation in
rules, policies, practices, and procedures to ensure equal access to housing
and facilitate the development of housing for individuals with such recognized
handicaps when the same may act as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.
   C.   There is hereby established a procedure for making requests for
reasonable accommodation in land use and zoning regulations, policies,
practices, and procedures to comply fully with the intent and purpose of fair
housing laws. Unless a group home has been granted reasonable accommodation as
provided in this Article, group homes shall comply with zoning regulations,
policies, practices, and procedures applicable to the zone in which they are
located.
(Am. Ord. O-2017-003, passed 1-23-2017)
