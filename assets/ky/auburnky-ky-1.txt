repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of the original
amendment.

have the effect of reviving the original language of the repealer or amendment
as the case may be.

offense committed against a former ordinance, nor as to any act done, or

arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment

the property owner, and the ratio the cost to each property owner bears to the
total cost of the entire project.
(KRS 91A.260)
§ 33.16 AFFECTED OWNER MAY CONTEST.
   (A)   Within 30 days of the mailing of the notice provided for in §
33.15, any affected property owner may file an action in the circuit court of
the county, contesting the undertaking of the project by special assessment,
the inclusion of his property in the improvement, or the amount of his
assessment. If the action contests the undertaking of the improvement by the
special assessment method of the inclusion of the property of that property
owner, no further action on the improvement insofar as it relates to any
property owner who is a plaintiff shall be taken until the final judgment has
been entered.
   (B)   The city may proceed with the improvement with respect to any
properties whose owners have not filed or joined in an action as provided in
this section or who have contested only the amounts of their assessments, and
the provisions of the resolution are final and binding with respect to such
property owners except as to contested amounts of assessments. After the lapse
of time as herein provided, all actions by owners of properties are forever
barred.
(KRS 91A.270)
§ 33.17 WHEN CITY MAY PROCEED; ASSESSMENT CONSTITUTES LIEN.
   (A)   After the passage of time for the action provided for in §
33.16, or after favorable final judgment in any such action, whichever comes
later, the city may proceed with the improvement or part thereof stayed by the
action, including notice requiring payment of special assessment or installment
thereon and bonds or other method proposed to finance the improvement. The
first installment may be apportioned so that other payments will coincide with
payment of ad valorem taxes.
   (B)   The amount of any outstanding assessment orinstallments thereof on any
property, and accrued interest and other charges, constitutes a lien on the
property to secure payment to the bondholders or any other source of financing
of the improvement. The lien takes precedence over all other liens, whether
created prior to or subsequent to the publication of the ordinance, except a
lien for state and county taxes, general municipal taxes, and prior improvement
taxes, and is not defeated or postponed by any private or judicial sale, by any
mortgage, or by any error or mistake in the description of the property or in
the names of the owners. No error in the proceedings of the Council shall
exempt any benefited property from the lien for the improvement assessment, or
from payment thereof, or from the penalties or interest thereon, as herein
provided.
(KRS 91A.280)
§ 33.18 EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL PROPERTY OR CHANGE IN FINANCING.
   The city may undertake any further proceedings to carry out the improvement
or any extension or refinancing thereof, except that§ §
33.13 through
33.17 applies if additional property is included in the improvement or if
change is made in the method or period of financing; but additional property
may be included in the improvement with the consent of the owner thereof
without compliance with other sections if it does not increase the cost
apportioned to any other property, or any other change may be made without such
compliance if all property owners of the improvement consent.

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 34.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)   As defined in §
34.01, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
34.12, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a request or complete a written application for such records at the
office of the City Clerk/Treasurer during regular office hours, except during
legal holidays. The written application shall be hand delivered, mailed, sent
via facsimile, or e-mailed to the City Clerk/Treasurer’s office. (KRS 61.872
(2))
   (B) If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in compliance
with the open records law and the requested records are immediately available,
the custodian shall deliver the records for inspection. Suitable facilities
shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk/Treasurer for the
inspection. No resident of the Commonwealth shall remove original copies of
public records from the offices of any public agency without the written
permission of the official custodian of the record. (KRS 61.872(1)).
   (C) A resident of the Commonwealth may inspect public records during the
regular business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public
records from the city through the mail if the applicant’s residence or
principal place of business is outside of the county in which the city is
located and he has precisely described public records which are available
within the city. If the resident of the Commonwealth requesting the public
records requests that the records be mailed, the official custodian shall mail
the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of mailing. (KRS 61.872(3)).
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the
public records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
34.01. (KRS 61.874(1))
   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format.
   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in
standard hard copy format where agencies currently maintain records in hard
copy format. Agencies are not required to convert hard copy format records to
electronic formats.
   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor’s requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(1))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874 (4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874 (5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).
(KRS 61.874(6))
§ 34.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk/Treasurer does not have custody or control of the public
record or records requested, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall so notify the
applicant and shall furnish the name and location of the custodian of the
public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 34.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed five days from receipt of the application, unless a detailed
explanation of the cause is given for further delay and the place, time, and
earliest date on which the public record will be available for inspection.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence. (KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian’s authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
(KRS 61.880)
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General’s request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General’s opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action. (KRS
61.880, 61.882)
§ 34.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.
   No official or employee of the city shall willfully conceal or destroy any
record with the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these rules
and regulations.
§ 34.11 ACCESS TO RECORDS RELATING TO PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.

      (3)   (a)Upon and after July 15, 1992, records confidentially disclosed

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under

different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or "Go": Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop": Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point

Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield

purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing yellow lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from

SNOW EMERGENCY
§ 72.35 ANNOUNCEMENT OF SNOW EMERGENCY.

parking announced by the Chief of Police or other authorized city official
under the authority of this section shall remain in effect until he announces

   (A)   Manner of keeping dogs and animals. No person shall keep or maintain
any dog or other animal in the city in such a manner so as to become a public
nuisance or to disturb the peace, comfort, or health of any person residing
within the city. The keeping of all animals within the city shall be subject to
all pertinent regulations of the state and Logan County Health Department.

the dog may not exit.
      (2)   Leash and muzzle. No person shall permit a vicious dog to go
outside of its kennel, pen, or the owner’s property unless such animal is
securely restrained with a leash or lead no longer than three feet in length
and the leash or lead is physically controlled by a person 18 years of age or
older who is in physical control of the leash. Such animals may not be leashed
to inanimate objects such as trees, posts, buildings, and the like. In
addition, all such animals on a leash or lead outside of the animal’s kennel,
pen, or the owner’s residence must be muzzled by a muzzling device sufficient

itself is insufficient to meet this standard. All structures used to confine
such animals must be locked with a key or combination lock when such animals
are within the structure. Such structure must have a secure bottom or floor
attached to the sides of the pen, or the sides of the pen must be embedded in
the ground to a depth of no less than two feet. All structures erected to house
such animals must comply with all zoning and building regulations, and all such
structures must be adequately lighted, ventilated, and be of appropriate size
to allow the animal confined therein to move around, and must be kept in a
clean and sanitary condition. The house or shelter for said animal shall be
totally enclosed within the confinement structure. When being transported, the
animal must be muzzled or caged.
         (a)   Signs. All owners of vicious dogs shall display on the kennel or
pen and also in a prominent place on the premises a sign easily read by the
public from adjoining public roads or streets using a sign stating the presence
of a vicious dog by both symbol and words.

control officers and enforcement agents the freedom to inspect the area as
necessary to assure that the health and safety needs of the animals and the
public are being met.

in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected by this ordinance,
in so far as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint. If the court
finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur,

however, the mayor first complies with the provisions of the fourth amendment
relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The mayor may issue subpoenas
to compel his access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance
of such persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same
extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or
interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the united
states district court for the district in which the investigation is taking
place. The mayor may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the mayor, a respondent shall be entitled
to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the

shall show on their face the name and address of such respondent and shall
state that they were issued at his request.

request of a respondent shall be paid by him.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the mayor to revoke or modify the subpoena. The mayor shall
grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires appearance or
attendance at an unreasonable time or place that it requires production of
evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does
not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that
compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the mayor, or
other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in
the municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom the
subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.

imprisoned not more than one year, or both. Any person who, with intent thereby
to misled the mayor, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or
statement of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted

interment space in a lot cannot be obtained, or are indefinite, or when, for
any reason, the interment space cannot be opened where specified, the

deems best and proper, so as not to delay the funeral. The city shall not be
liable for damages in any error so made.
   (F)   Instructions. Detailed written instructions are desired by the

right to correct any errors that may be made by it either in making interments,

conveyance and substituting and conveying in lieu thereof, or the interment
property of equal value and similar location as far as possible or as may be
selected by the cemetery management, or, in the sole discretion of cemetery
management, by refunding the amount of money paid on account of such purchase.
In the event such error shall involve the interment of the remains of any
person in such property, cemetery management reserves, and shall have, the
right to remove or transfer such remains so interred to such other property of
equal value and similar location as may be substituted and conveyed in lieu
thereof.
   (H)   Disclaimer of liability. The city shall in no way be liable for any
delay in the interment of a body where a protest to the interment has been

interment permit nor the identity of the person sought to be interred.
   (J)   Payment. No interment shall be permitted or memorial placed in or on
any property not fully paid.

of interment rights is for one body or two cremains per single space only. For
additional fees and charges, in addition to one traditional burial, up to one
cremains may be placed in one plot. In the special areas designated solely for
cremains only one set of cremains may be placed in each plot. Only one vertical
monument is allowed per burial space, and then, only where permitted by
cemetery management. Regardless of how many individuals' remains are buried in
one grave space, only one headstone per space is permitted. A footstone in
memory of a cremated individual may be added to a grave space where a headstone
already exists. For mausoleum crypts: (a) no more than one casket and one
cremation urn or two cremation urns may be entombed in an individual mausoleum

of any body, other than that of a human being, shall be permitted in the
cemetery.
   (M)   Records. The number of burial rights sold on any lot will be recorded
on the burial certificate when the lot and interment rights are purchased.
   (N)   Placement. No grave shall be placed in an irregular appearance with
graves on the same or adjoining lots.
   (O)   Verification. All orders for interments in lots must be approved by
the certificate holder of the lot or the certificate holder's legal
representative. When this is impossible because of illness or other reasonable
cause, fax or telephone permission will be accepted but will make the person
calling responsible and any change of location made after the opening is begun
shall be at the expense of the certificate holder of the lot. Should the
certificate holder fail or neglect to make such designation, cemetery
management reserves the right to make interment in accordance with normal
procedure. The cemetery management assumes no responsibility for any error in
such location and an additional charge will be made for any change requested.
   (P)   Exclusive service. Designated contractual services hired by the City
of Auburn will be the only workers permitted to open and close graves.

for graveside use.
   (S)   Unauthorized cremains. The city disavows all responsibility and
liability therefor, and the certificate holder, their next of kin, and all
others using, knowingly or not, the cemetery hereby waive any and all duty upon
the city, and otherwise agree to hold the city harmless, including the cost of
its legal defense and reasonable attorneys’ cost, arising from any unauthorized
cremains in the cemetery. Increasingly, cremains are divided, dispersed, made
into jewelry, lost in whole or part, co-mingled, placed in caskets of others,
scattered on burial locations of others, deliberately or clandestinely
disposed, legally or not, and otherwise handled in such a way as to render
difficult or impossible an accurate accounting of their complete and final
dispensation, often including the absence of appropriate next of kin
authorization and control of the cremains. Any cremains, in whole or part,
finding its way into the cemetery absent an express pre-authorization and
release by the prerequisite next of kin of the decedent to cemetery management
beforehand, whether placed allegedly with knowledge or not of the city, has no
standing or rights, forevermore upon the cemetery for anything arising from the
unauthorized cremains, including but not limited to; memorialization thereof,
disinterment or dis-inurnment, claim or liability asserted by its next of kin
or others upon the city, acknowledgment in the city records, decoration rights,
visitation rights, etc. All such unauthorized cremains finding their way into
the cemetery, by any means, shall be considered a criminal trespass upon the
cemetery by it, the person(s) who committed the trespass, and its next of kin
thereafter as relates to the unauthorized cremains. The city, in the strongest
expression of words possible, hereby disavows all responsibility, duty and
liability arising from such unauthorized cremains in the cemetery.

§ 99.14 DISINTERMENTS AND REMOVALS.
   (A)   Prohibited. Removal, by the heirs, of a body or cremated remains so
that the plot may be sold for profit to themselves, or removal contrary to

indebtedness due the city for work performed in or upon the lot.
   (E)   Opening of caskets. Once a casket containing a body is within the
confines of the cemetery, no funeral director nor his embalmer, assistant,

signed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

foundation in the space reserved for a bench or a monument. Benches will be
considered a monument and will be subject to all rules applying to monuments.
   (W)   Donated benches. Benches of granite material shall be allowed to be
donated to cemetery for placement approval by cemetery management in areas
which will provide for silent reverie and reflection. Such benches shall be
near uniform in appearance and inscriptions shall have the prior approval of
the cemetery management. No form or type of advertising shall be allowed on
benches.
   (X)   Maintenance duty. Certificate holders, their representative or heirs
and assigns are responsible for the maintenance of their monuments.
   (Y)   Installation of monuments and markers. Those persons engaged in
placing or erecting monuments and other structures, or grinding materials,
shall operate as independent contractors, but must do so under permission from
cemetery management and must be under the general supervision of the
Maintenance Supervisor. Those persons engaged in placing monuments and markers
shall provide planking adequate to protect turf and shall remove materials and
equipment immediately upon completion of work. Persons engaged in erecting
monuments, or other structures are prohibited from attaching ropes to
monuments, trees and shrubs, or from scattering their material over adjoining
lots, or from blocking avenues or pathways, or from leaving material on the
grounds longer than is absolutely necessary. They must do as little injury to
the grass, trees and shrubs as possible, and must remove all debris and restore
the ground and sod to its original condition, leaving the site clean and
orderly.
   (Z)   Monument service firms. Letter cutters, persons or firms who engage in
the business of cleaning monuments, and all other persons or firms, must
procure permission from cemetery management before any work in the cemetery is
commenced.
   (AA)   Contractors' insurance. All contractors within the cemetery must
first provide proof of general liability insurance to cemetery management
before performing work. If any company has an accident, damage any property,
gets hurt, or hurts someone they shall be responsible.
   (BB)   Responsibility for damage. Dealers or contractors, their agents or
principal, or individuals are liable for any damage done to lots, walks,
drives, trees, shrubs, adjoining lots or other property.
   (CC)   Equipment holdover. No material machinery, or other thing for the
construction of vaults, mausoleums, monuments, or other structures, or
monuments themselves, may be brought into the cemetery until required for
immediate use; nor, under any circumstances, when a funeral is in progress; nor
between Saturday and Monday morning; nor on a holiday; and no work shall be
done during said time; nor shall said material be placed on lots adjoining the
one on which such a structure is to be erected, without special permission from
cemetery management.
   (DD)   Prompt performance. Work shall proceed promptly until the erection of
the memorial is completed.
   (EE)   Funeral interference. While a funeral or interment is being conducted
nearby, all work of any description shall not disturb.
   (FF)   Respect for the grieving. Approaching the bereaved and soliciting
memorial business within the cemetery is not permitted.
   (GG)   Conformance to the rules. Memorial dealers shall abide by all rules
of the cemetery.
   (HH)   Notice. Monuments throughout the cemetery may fall over and cause
harm to persons and property if misused. Standard use and practice in the
industry of monument installation is that monument pieces are often not
physically connected together or to its foundation in any way, and even if
caulk or adhesive was used by its initial installer its adhesion can and does
fail over time. All monuments are the personal property and responsibility of
the individual purchasing family and do not belong to the city. Do not lean,
sit, or stand on, nor pull against or otherwise exert lateral force of any kind
against monuments in the cemetery at any time, as they are not designed for
such and may fall over and do harm.
   (II)   Safety. All upright monuments over two feet high must be able to
withstand a force of 75 pounds when such force is applied at any point on the
memorial. Such monuments must withstand this force when set in a dry mode (i.e.
without the assistance of any adhesive material). Dowels (300 series stainless
or equivalent) may be used to assist an upright monument in achieving the 75-
pound minimum standard. The intended positioning of such dowels must be shown/
stated on the contract requesting the installation of the monument. All
portions of an upright monument must be sealed together with an appropriate
sealing material and shall be sealed together in such a way as to provide an
adequate level of stability.
   (JJ)   Height. All upright monuments over two feet six inches in height
(including the base) must be at least eight inches thick.
   (KK)   Depth. Any single monument more than 30 inches in height including
base must be eight inches in depth. All double monuments must be no less than
eight inches in depth.
   (LL)   Monument removal. No monument or marker shall be removed from the
cemetery, except by the city unless the written order of the certificate holder
(s), their representative or heirs and assigns is presented at the office of
the City Clerk and permission granted by the administrator.

99.99
§ 99.16 MAUSOLEUMS.
   (A)   Plans and specifications. The plans and specifications for a mausoleum
or above ground vault shall be submitted to the cemetery management and the
location on the lot approved before a permit for the erection will be issued.
Building permits, if any, shall be the responsibility of the certificate holder
to secure and provide copy of same to the city prior to construction.
Sufficient time must be given to the city to have the plans of such structures
thoroughly reviewed.
   (B)   Approval. The city shall have the right to refuse a permit for the
erection of any structure which in the opinion of the cemetery management is
improper or not in harmony with other surrounding structures.
   (C)   Endowment for upkeep. Permanent arrangements for the endowment of a
mausoleum or vault will be required from the certificate holder or certificate
holder's legal representative before a permit for the construction of the
mausoleum can be obtained. The endowment must be sufficient to assure adequate
funds for the upkeep and maintenance of the structure and grounds based on
present and projected costs. If permanent arrangements for upkeep are not
provided, an endowment will be required sufficient for demolition costs in the
event of disrepair or deterioration. The income from this endowment fund will
be used exclusively to maintain and care for the mausoleum. The amount of the
fund will be determined by the cemetery's management but will not be less than
10% of the total cost of the lot and structure.
   (D)   Removal of neglected mausoleums. Any mausoleum or vault which becomes
unsightly or dangerous, through neglect by the certificate holder or lack of
funds may be removed and the remains therein buried in the lot. The cost of
removing the structure shall be taken out of the vault or mausoleum endowment
fund and the balance returned to the persons entitled to the same. Underground
vaults covered above the ground by slabs are permitted only on monumental lots.
   (E)   City's right to enforce rules. All endowment certificates for the
maintenance of mausoleums or vaults will contain a clause that will give the
city the right to enforce any rules adopted by it.
   (F)   Separation of crypts. All remains must be in separate crypts, which
can be hermetically sealed to cemetery regulations.
(Ord. 2021-11, passed 11-8-21)
§ 99.99 PENALTY.
   Anyone who violates this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall
be fined not more than $500 for each offense. Each day's continued violation
shall constitute a separate offense.

(Ord. 2011-07, passed 11-14-11)
§ 110.04 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, gross receipts
shall be apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the gross receipts by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in subsection (2) of this
section, plus the sales factor, described in subsection (3) of this section,
and the denominator of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the gross receipts by the sales factor as set forth in
subsection (3) of this section.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than

         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will
fairly represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of gross receipts.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
"passed through" these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this ordinance on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section

severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
subsection unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for,
or pay over the tax imposed by this ordinance at the time that the taxes
imposed by this ordinance become or became due.
   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H), every employee receiving
compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
110.03 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the tax levied under this ordinance from the
employee, such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the
city each quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer.

   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its

   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this ordinance shall keep records, render under oath

may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems sufficient to
determine the tax liability the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the taxable income

(Ord. 2002-07, passed 11-11-02) Penalty, see 115.99
§ 115.09 APPROVAL; DENIAL.
   (A)   After an applicant’s submission of an application to construct a
cellular antenna tower, the Board shall:
      (1)   Review the application in light of its agreement with the
comprehensive plan and locally adopted subdivision regulations;
      (2)   Make its final decision to approve or disapprove the application;
and
      (3)   Advise the applicant in writing of its final decision within 60
days commencing from the date that the application is submitted to the Board or
within a date certain specified in a written agreement between the Board and

shall be issued until the Board approves the application or the 60-day time
period has expired, whichever occurs first.
   (C)   The Board may require the applicant to make a reasonable attempt to
co-locate additional transmitting or related equipment. It is the intent of
these regulations to encourage the co-location and clustering of multiple
transmission towers and their antennas and accessory facilities, and to
discourage the use of individual transmission towers and accessory facility
sites. Therefore, more than one transmission tower will be permitted under
these regulations on a single tract of land notwithstanding any other provision
of this chapter, provided they meet all of the required location standards. The
Board may provide the location of existing cellular antenna towers on which the
Board deems the applicant can successfully co-locate its transmitting and
related equipment. If the Board requires the applicant to attempt co-location,
the applicant shall provide the Board with a statement indicating that the
applicant has:
      (1)   Successfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to host
multiple wireless service providers’ facilities or existing structures such as
a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of supporting
the applicant’s facilities, and that identifies the location of the tower or
suitable structure on which the applicant will co-locate its transmission and
related facilities; or
      (2)   Unsuccessfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to host
multiple wireless service providers’ facilities or existing structures such as
a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of supporting
the applicant’s facilities, and that:
         (a)   Identifies the location of the towers or other structures on
which the applicant attempted to co-locate; and
         (b)   Lists the reasons why the co-location was unsuccessful in each
instance.
   (D)   The Board may deny an application to construct a cellular antenna
tower based on an applicant’s unwillingness to attempt to co- locate additional
transmitting or related equipment on any new or existing towers or other
structures.
   (E)   In the event of co-location, a utility shall be considered the primary
user of the tower if the utility is the owner of the antenna tower and if no
other agreement exists that prescribes an alternate arrangement between the
parties for use of the tower. Any other entity that co-locates transmission or
related facilities on a cellular antenna tower shall do so in a manner that
does not impose additional costs or operating restrictions on the primary user.
   (F)   Upon the approval of an application for the construction of a cellular
antenna tower by the Board, the applicant shall notify the Public Service
Commission within ten working days of the approval. The notice to the Public
Service Commission shall include a map showing the location of the construction
site. If an applicant fails to file notice of an approved uniform application
with the Public Service Commission, the applicant shall be prohibited from
beginning construction on the cellular antenna tower until such notice has been
made.
   (G)   A party aggrieved by a final action of the Board under the provisions
of KRS 100.985 to 100.987 may bring an action for review in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 116.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), and on studies in other communities including but not limited to:
Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the
Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulations of Sexually
Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
does and will create unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A/Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States - 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)   As of June 30, 2001, there have been 3,481 reported cases of AIDS
in the State of Kentucky.
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Kentucky and more specifically in Logan County. As of June 30, 2000 there were
2,560 cases of persons living with HIV which had not developed into AIDS, in
the state of Kentucky.
      (10)   The number of cases of early stages of syphilis (less than one
year) in the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases
reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990. These numbers have grown
even more in the past 10 years.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986 advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult"
oriented films.
      (16)   The findings noted in division(B)(1) through (B)(15) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a presently nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of
Auburn. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      (24)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (25)   The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any property taxes,
both real and personal, any other taxes due to the city, fees of any type, or
charges due to any department of the city at the time of issuing the license,
nor may any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or
property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any of the
above delinquent payments due and owing to the city. Further, if a licensee
becomes delinquent in the payment of any of the above at any time during the
license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be subject
to revocation or suspension; and
      (4)   No person, whether applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in
any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the City
ABC Administrator, or any member of the city's staff, or any state ABC
Administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This division is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or state ABC
Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a
license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for
appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this
chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit monetary
settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order
or revocation or suspension, where this chapter and applicable statutes allow
for such payments in settlement.
   (D)   Form of license. All city licenses shall be in such form as may be
provided by the ABC Administrator, but at a minimum shall contain:
      (1)   The name and address of the licensee;
      (2)   The number of the license;
      (3)   The type of license;
      (4)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the licensed
premises;
      (5)   The name and address of the owner of the building in which the
licensed premises are located;
      (6)   The expiration date of the license;
      (7)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a property
or vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to law.
   (E)   Change of information.
      (1)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the City ABC Administrator with ten days of the change.
      (2)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The
City ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
      (3)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other
business organization herein, the word "change" is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the
corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures 10% of
the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than 10% of the total
ownership or stock shall require a new license.
      (4)   The following information shall be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
         (a)   Name and address;
         (b)   Nature of interest;
         (c)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         (d)   Date of birth;
         (e)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of
Kentucky. If a city resident, indicate when residence was established;
         (f)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license
or in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding
a license under this act;
         (g)   Extent of stock or company ownership; and
         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in
any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license in any other state or province.
      (5)   This information shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator as
a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten days of any change of required
information.
   (F)   Renewal of license.
      (1)   Every year, except in the case of the temporary licenses, each
licensee shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the
City ABC Administrator no less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the
license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except
where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises
licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act
of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the
premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private
organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
exiting lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less than 20 days from the expiration date of the license, setting
forth these facts, and the City ABC Administrator is hereby authorized to
extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a reasonable length
of time within the sound discretion of the City ABC Administrator; provided,
however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from the expiration date of the
former license or licenses. Said license fee shall not by payable until
application is made for the transfer of said license to a new location.
      (2)   The renewal by the City ABC Administrator of the license shall not
be construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior
to such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the
licensee.
   (G)   Lost or destroyed license. When a license shall be lost or destroyed
without fault on the part of the licensee or his or her agent or employee, a
duplicate in lieu of the original license shall be issued by the City ABC
Administrator after the Administrator shall have been satisfied as to the
facts; provided, however, that the applicant for said duplicate license shall
pay a fee of $10 for the duplicate license.
   (H)   Revocation or suspension.
      (1)   Any license may be revoked or suspended by the City ABC
Administrator if the licensee shall have violated any of other provisions of
KRS Chapters 241 through 244, or any rule or regulation of the ABC Board, or of
the Kentucky Department of Revenue, relating to the regulation of the
manufacture, sale, and transportation, or taxation, of alcoholic beverages or
if such licensee shall have violated or shall violate any act of Congress or
any rule or regulation of any federal board, agency or commission, or this
chapter now, heretofore, or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of
the manufacture, sale, and transportation, or taxation, of intoxicating
liquors, or any rules or regulations of the city heretofore in existence or
authorized by the terms of KRS Chapters 241 through 244 to be created,
irrespective of whether the licensee knew of or permitted the violation or
whether the violation was committed is disobedience of his or her instructions,
or any such license may be revoked or suspended for any cause which the City
ABC Administrator in the exercise of his or her sound discretion deems
sufficient.
      (2)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the City
ABC Administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had
been known.
      (3)   In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be
revoked or suspended for the following causes:
         (a)   Conviction of the licensee or his or her agent or employee for
selling any illegal beverages on the premises licensed.
         (b)   Making any false, material statements in an application for a
license.
         (c)   If within a period of two consecutive years, any licensee or any
clerk, servant, agent or employee of the licensee shall have been convicted of
two violations of the terms and provisions of KRS Chapters 241 through 244 or
any act heretofore or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the
manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages or if within such
period, any licensee or any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the license
shall have twice been convicted of any felony or of any misdemeanor directly or
indirectly attributable to the use of alcoholic beverages, or of one such
felony and one such misdemeanor.
         (d)   Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee to pay
an excise tax or any part thereof or any penalties imposed by or under the
provisions of any statutes, this chapter, or acts of Congress relative to
taxation or for a violation of any rules or regulations of the Kentucky
Department of Revenue made in pursuance thereof.
         (e)   Setting up, conducting, operating or keeping, on the licensed
premises, any gambling game, device, machine or contrivance, or gift
enterprise, or handbook or facility for betting or transmitting bets on horse
races; or permitting to be set up, conducted, operated, kept, or engaged in, on
the licensed premises, any such game, device, machine, contrivance, gift
enterprise, handbook or facility.
   (I)   Proceedings for revocation or suspension of license.
      (1)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of
any law enforcement officer, or of the City ABC Administrator, the City ABC
Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license
granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after
the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered
mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such
proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in
opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or
in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
      (2)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall be those set out in the Kentucky Administrative
Procedure Act (KAR Chapter 13B).
      (3)   A decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or suspending a
license may be appealed as provided in KRS 243.550.
      (4)   Within three days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the City ABC Administrator. If the revoked or
suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of
Police, at the request of the City ABC Administrator, shall immediately cause
one of his or her officers to take physical possession of the license and
return it to the City ABC Administrator.
      (5)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee
may, with prior approval of the City ABC Administrator, dispose of and transfer
his or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
      (6)   Appeal from the decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or
suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board within 30 days from the decision
of the City ABC Administrator. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay
further proceedings for revocation.
      (7)   If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the City ABC
Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at once
suspend all operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the entry of a
final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on
appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under this
license.
   (J)   Transfer or assignment. No license issued under this chapter shall be
transferred or assigned either as to licensee or location except with prior
approval of the City ABC Administrator and not then until a payment of $100
shall be made to the City ABC Administrator.
   (K)   Refusal of license; guidelines for approval of quota licenses.
      (1)   The City ABC Administrator may refuse to issue a license for any of
the following reasons:
         (a)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for
suspension or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for
state licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as
violation of any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or
the administration thereof.
         (b)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of
license would be authorized under local, state, or federal law; or
         (c)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
      (2)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the City ABC
Administrator may appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KRS 241.200.
   (L)   Review of license; books, records and reports.
      (1)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter
shall provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions
of any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant's business income is earned from the sale
of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated
with the applicant's quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide
the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identity each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of
food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for
filing of reports notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the
premises of any licensee and examine the books and records to determine whether
the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this chapter. In the event the
conditions of any license requirement are not met during any particular
quarter, the City ABC Administrator shall have discretion in determining
whether revocation is appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a
reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is
demonstrated by the licensee, the City ABC Administrator may apply an
accounting period of at least one year in determining whether or not the food
sale percentage requirement has been met.
      (2)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain, upon the
licensed premises, adequate books and records of all transactions involved in
the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the City ABC Administrator and such city
employees who may assist the City ABC Administrator in his or her review.
      (3)   For the purpose of assisting the City ABC Administrator in
enforcement of this chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC Board
under KRS 243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the City ABC
Administrator. Copies of any and all reports and correspondences to the ABC
Board required by statute shall be furnished to the City ABC Administrator.
   (M)   Dormancy.
      (1)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after 90 days. Such is the intent of this section.
Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her business
interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various exceptions to
the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
      (2)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period
of 90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in
division (M)(3) below are proved to the satisfaction of the City ABC
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the City
ABC Administrator.
      (3)   The provisions of division (M)(2) hereof shall not apply to any
licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a
license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing
lease. Prior to the expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall
furnish to the City ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the
fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the
specific reasons set forth herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an
extension of the dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect
during the license period or until same is transferred to another premises,
notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted during said period;
provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid unless business is
conducted there under within 12 months from the date of notice to the City ABC
Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of
his or her sound discretion.

than three inches in height, stating that congregating of persons is prohibited
and that violators shall be prosecuted for trespass pursuant to KRS 511.080.

shall not be an exclusive use. All public improvements, including but not
limited to, trees, light poles, traffic signals, pull boxes or manholes, or any

the public sidewalk at all times.
      (4)   The licensee shall, in addition to all other requirements of law,
take reasonable steps to insure that alcoholic beverages are consumed only by
patrons of the establishment who are of age, and not by passersby or persons

shall not permit any alcoholic beverages to be taken off premises by patrons,
customers or guests.

imposed by law arising out of the ownership, maintenance or operation of such
sidewalk café, in an amount to be established by the City Attorney and the
city's safety coordinator. The city shall be named an additional insured in the
policy required. Such insurance policy shall further provide expressly that it
may not be canceled except upon ten day's written notice (or more) filed with

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS Chapter 100
delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed
to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council of Auburn, Kentucky, hereby adopts the following
floodplain management ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Auburn are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume

same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. “ACCESSORY STRUCTURES” should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
“ACCESSORY STRUCTURES” are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole
barns, and hay sheds.

a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas,
as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of
the current.
      (4)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding.

open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.

regulatory floodway.
   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in §
151.60, Appeals and Variance Procedures, of this chapter, means that the
variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In
examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every
newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a
part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In
addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject
to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance
rates.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.

manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “GOVERNING BODY.” The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.” The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The “HAZARD POTENTIAL” classification
of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:

states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:

approved programs.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).”
      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage means under the standard
flood insurance policy the cost to repair a substantially flood damaged
building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a
substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage
prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are floodproofing
(nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination
thereof.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   “LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by letter, to

LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property
is not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).” A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.

constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   “LEVEE SYSTEM.” A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   “LIMITED STORAGE.” An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.

attached garage, deck support, basement entryway or grade immediately next to
the structure and after the completion of construction.
   “LOWEST FLOOR.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area

The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been
revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first
revision.)
   “MARKET VALUE.” The property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and
seller), excluding the value of the land as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. “MARKET VALUE” of the structure can be established by
independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of
structure (actual cash value) or adjusted assessed values.
   “MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).” The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on the community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988.
   “MITIGATION.” Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
costs of disaster response and recovery.
   “MUDSLIDE (i.e. MUDFLOW).” Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a
dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water
on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
“MUDSLIDE (i.e. MUDFLOW)” may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide

nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   “NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD).” As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRM’s. Refer to

   “NEW CONSTRUCTION.” Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by
a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   “NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site

conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   “ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD)” (see “BASE FLOOD”). The flood that
has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any
flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to inundation by the 100-

experiencing such a flood with the SFHA.
   “PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY.” A community that voluntarily elects to
participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management
regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.
   “POST-FIRM CONSTRUCTION.” New construction or substantial improvements for
which start of construction occurred after December 31, 1974, or on or after

         (b)   Two or more separate claim payments (building payments only)
where the total of the payments exceeds the current market value of the
property.
      (2)   In either case, two of the claim payments must have occurred within
ten years of each other. Multiple losses at the same location within ten days

   “SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).” That portion of the floodplain subject
to inundation by the base flood and/or flood-related erosion hazards as shown
on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AO, or AR.
   “START OF CONSTRUCTION (INCLUDES SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT AND OTHER PROPOSED
NEW DEVELOPMENT).” The date a building permit is issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
placement or other improvement is within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure
(including manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or

paid out where all or part of the damage can be attributed to acts or omissions
by a community or other third party.
   “SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to it’s before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   “SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, taking place during a one-year period in
which the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code Enforcement Official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.

§ 151.13 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION NOTICE AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain development permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this ordnance
and/or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain development permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation
is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set forth in the
citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or requesting a
hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the citation is issued
does not respond to the citation within seven days, that person shall be deemed
to have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a violation
occurred shall be considered final.
   (D)   Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special
exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined no less than $1,000 or imprisoned for not
more than 90 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses
involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain
Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent
or remedy any violation.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 151.25 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Council of Auburn hereby appoints the Mayor or designee to
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting
or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions, and is herein
referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
§ 151.26 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
151.07. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of floodplain
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§
151.41(B) and
151.43(B);
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the Community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, the
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)

actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
151.60(C)(1);
         (b)   When base flood elevation data and floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
151.07, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonable
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§
151.40 through
151.46;
         (c)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
151.41(B) a floodproofing certificate;

§ 151.40 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In all Special Flood Hazard Areas the following provisions are required:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
   (B)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces;
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition equipment,
and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding; and if
   (F)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (G)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
   (H)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;
   (I)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;

(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
§ 151.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
151.07, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than one foot
above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used
to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate automatic
equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall be provided in
accordance with standards of division (C) of this section.
         (a)   In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the
highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number
specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest
adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
         (b)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data
can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than one (1) foot
above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative
Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the
technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: The applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base
Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross
sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations.
         (c)   In all other Zones, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed to an elevation one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification along with
the design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) of this
section.
      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an
elevation one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this requirement
must meet or exceed the standards of division (C) of this section.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring.
         (a)   Locations include:
            1.   On individual lots or parcels;
            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            3.   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood;
         (b)   All such manufactured homes must be:
            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above
the level of the base flood elevation; and
            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one foot above the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (3)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-30,
AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must either:
         (a)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         (c)   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured
homes”.
      (4)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed
and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations,
is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
151.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If this division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
151.40 through
151.46.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
§ 151.42 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.07, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or
where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
151.07.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
§ 151.43 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as stated in §
151.41(B).
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
§ 151.44 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the
elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available, base flood elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals and
other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.
   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure
(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood
elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
§ 151.45 STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE
LETTER ‘A’.
   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated ‘A’
the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Must be non-habitable;
   (B)   Must be anchored to resist floatation and lateral movement;
   (C)   Must be provided with flood openings in accordance with the standards
of §
151.41(C);
   (D)   Must be built of flood resistant materials to one foot above the base
flood elevation;
   (E)   Must elevate utilities one foot above the base flood elevation;
   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking; and
   (G)   Must not be modified for a different use after permitting.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
§ 151.46 CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of
new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however,
they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation at the
site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 7-9-12)
APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 151.60 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance
are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a
piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for
a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to
the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. City Council of Auburn shall
establish a Variance and Appeal Board consisting of members of the City
Council.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Variance and Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Variance and Appeal
Board may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky
Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Variance
and Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
existing or proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent use;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and
culverts.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Variance and Appeal Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
      (5)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of division (D) of this
section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Auburn Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and
report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
