      (3)   The following is the Forward to Robert’s Rules of Orders Revised.
 
From Foreword to Robert’s Rules of Order Revised...
“...The rules within these pages make up the most widely accepted guide to fair and
orderly meetings. They are applicable within the framework of any political belief
and within the structure of any club, organization, or meeting that must transact
business.
 
Parliamentary procedure, properly used, provides the means whereby the affairs of
an organization or club can be controlled by the general will within the whole
membership, the “general will”, in this sense, does not always imply even near
unanimity or “consensus” but rather the right of the deliberate majority to decide.
Complementary to this right is the right of the minority - at least a strong
minority - to require the majority to be deliberate - that is, to act according to
its considered judgment after a full and fair “working through” of the issues
involved”. (Pg., Robert’s Rules of Order, most recent edition)
 
Further, “...there should always be flexibility as to the strictness of application
of the rules - dependent on the particular situation and the members’ knowledge of
parliamentary procedure.” (Pg vi, Robert’s Rules of Order, most recent edition)
 
      (4)   Division (G) above notwithstanding, any elected official who is
present may address the Court in a peaceful and orderly manner so long as he or
she receives recognition from the presiding officer and so long as his or her
comments are germane to the order item at hand.
   (K)   Ordinances, orders, and resolutions.
      (1)   An ORDINANCE means a general act of the Fiscal Court enforceable by
law or an appropriation of money; all other acts or orders are resolutions.
      (2)   All ordinances shall relate to one subject only; and contain a
title which expresses the following subject: “An Ordinance relating to...”
      (3)   County ordinances shall be amended by ordinance and only by setting
out each amended section.
      (4)   No county ordinance shall be passed until it has been read on two
separate days, but ordinances may be read by title and a summary only.
      (5)   No county ordinance shall be passed until it has been published
pursuant to KRS Ch. 424. Prior to passage, ordinances may be published by
summary. Publication shall include the time, date, and place at which the
county ordinance will be considered, and a place within the county where a copy
of the full text of the proposed ordinance is available for public inspection.
In the event consideration for passage is continued from the initial meeting to
a subsequent date, no further publication is necessary; provided, that at each
meeting the time, date, and place of the next meeting is announced.
      (6)   All county ordinances and amendments shall be published after
passage and may be published in full or in summary form at the discretion of
the Fiscal Court.
      (7)   Traffic, building, housing, plumbing, electrical, safety, and other
self-contained codes may be adopted by reference if a copy of the code is kept
with the adopting ordinance and is made a part of the permanent records of the
county.
      (8)   County ordinances other than the budget ordinance shall be indexed
in a composite index of all current county ordinances and placed in a three-
ring binder according to the Kentucky Ordinance Code Topical Numbering System.
Each ordinance shall be listed in the index by date and title no later than 30
days after passage and any required approval.
   (L)   Administrative code. The Fiscal Court shall adopt a county
administrative code pursuant to KRS 68.005(2) which includes, but is not
limited to, procedures and designation of responsibility for the following:
      (1)   General administration of the Office of County Judge/Executive,
county administrative agencies, and public authorities;
      (2)   Administration of county fiscal affairs;
      (3)   Personnel administration;
      (4)   County purchasing and award of contracts; and

meeting and make the agenda available to the public not less than two business
days before each meeting.
      (3)   A majority of the members of the agency board shall constitute a

made except upon concurrence of a majority of members present.
      (4)   A record of all motions and official actions taken by the agency
shall be kept and a copy submitted to the County Judge/Executive and made

record.
      (3)   Action at a special meeting shall be limited to the issues stated
in the call.
   (C)   Procedures for appointment or removal of administrative personnel and
members of boards and commissions.
      (1)   The Judge/Executive shall nominate qualified persons to serve in
administrative positions and on boards and commissions and inform the Fiscal
Court at a regular meeting of his or her intention to make an appointment.
Generally, the nomination will be made, then the Fiscal Court will be asked to
take action on the nomination at its next meeting. However, in some cases, the
County Judge/Executive may request immediate action on a nomination. If the
Fiscal Court does not act on the nomination within 30 days, said nomination
shall be deemed approved by the Fiscal Court. A majority of those Fiscal Court
members present at the time the vote is taken shall vote in favor of the
nomination in order for it to be approved.
      (2)   No person shall be selected as a member of a board or commission or
for an administrative position if such person holds or is employed in a
position which is incompatible with the one for which he or she is nominated.
      (3)   When Fiscal Court approval of an appointment is not required by
state law, the Judge/Executive shall make such appointment. Within ten days of
making the appointment, the Judge/Executive shall notify the Fiscal Court in
writing of the appointment. Such notice may be filed with the County Clerk.
      (4)   Before any administrative personnel, board, or commission member
may be dismissed, such person shall be presented, in writing, with a list of
reasons for the dismissal. A hearing shall be conducted by the Judge/Executive
or his or her duly-appointed representative no sooner than 15, and no later
than 30 days, after receipt of the reasons for dismissal. At such hearing, the
person sought to be dismissed shall have an opportunity to make a statement on
his or her behalf, to be represented by anyone of his or her choosing, to call
witnesses and present evidence, and to question any witnesses which may testify
against him or her. The Judge/Executive shall thereupon make a written
recommendation to the Court which shall contain the facts upon which his or her
determination is based. The Court shall, at its next regular meeting, after
receipt of the report, vote whether or not to approve the dismissal. The
majority of those Fiscal Court members present at the time the vote is taken
may either affirm or reject the dismissal whereupon they shall issue a written
opinion which shall contain the facts upon which the determination is made. The
Fiscal Court’s decision shall be final and binding. Any administrative
personnel, board, or commission member whose term of office expires shall not
be considered to have been dismissed, therefore, this section does not apply to
the expiration of a term.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 33.01 CLASSIFICATION AND PAY PLAN AND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Judge/Executive shall be responsible for the development of a
classification and pay plan and policies procedures as approved by the County
Fiscal Court.
   (B)   All department heads shall keep on file, a written description of each
job in his or her department, including, but not limited to, characteristics of
the position; examples of duties, training, and experience needed; special
knowledge, skills, or abilities needed; and physical requirements and
environmental conditions. Each department head shall submit all job
descriptions to the County Judge/Executive to keep on file in his or her office
and to be adopted as part of this section. For job descriptions, see 
Chapter 32 of this code of ordinances.
   (C)    Records of employee work activity shall be maintained by the
supervisor or a delegated employee of each department or office of the county.
Absence from work shall be indicated on each employee’s time card (or
electronic equivalent) along with the type of leave, if any, the employee is
entitled to. If an employee is absent because of his or her own sickness, or
sickness of immediate family, and has accumulated leave, eight should be
indicated on his or her paper time card in the total hours worked column as 8s.
In a like manner leave, holiday or military time should be indicated as 8l, 8h,
and 8m respectively. If paid leave is not deserved, the space shall be left
blank. Electronic time cards will require vendor-specific methods of requesting
paid time off. The supervisor and employee shall both certify by their
signatures on each time card (or electronic equivalent) the correctness of time
shown. Cumulative records will also be maintained by the Treasurer’s Office,
based on the certified time cards furnished to his or her office. No employee
will be paid for time not deserved. Any attempt to falsify time records shall
be cause for discipline.
   (D)   The following are various types of employment practiced by the county.
Each type may be accorded different benefits.
      (1)   Salaried employee. One who is employed by the county on a salary
basis as opposed to an hourly wage, contract, fee, or other basis. Salaried
employees will be expected to work a minimum number of hours as defined by
their position job description;
      (2)   Part-time employee. One who is employed to work, on average, 23
hours or less per week at an hourly or per-diem rate of compensation. If an
employee must be hired to work 24 to 34 hours per week, he or she will be
considered part-time except in regard to the County Employees Retirement System
in which he or she must participate. Part-time employees shall be considered
at-will employees, and may be discharged by a supervisor, without cause, at any
time. Appeal of such action shall not be granted under any circumstances;
      (3)   Full-time employee. One who is employed to work 34 to 40 hours per
week at an hourly rate. A time card (or electronic equivalent) must reflect
whatever leave is used to make up time not worked up to 34 hours. However, in
special circumstances, when all paid leave is used up, an employee may retain
full-time status by working at least 28 hours per week with approval of the
County Judge/Executive; or
      (4)   Temporary employee. One who is employed for a limited period of
time, who may be discharged by a supervisor at any time, or without cause.
Appeal shall not be granted. This includes seasonal employees.
   (E)   Leave for all regular employees of the county will be as follows:
      (1)   Eight hours paid leave is earned per calendar month worked. Said
days may be taken after the end of the calendar month that they are earned,
upon approval of the supervisor. There shall be no limit to the accumulation of
leave time. A supervisor may refuse to grant an employee leave at a particular
time should the employee fail to request the leave two weeks in advance, or if
the work of the department would be seriously interrupted. Leave may be taken a
day at a time as needed or during a continuous period. Regular employees of
Barren County Fiscal Court who leave employment in good standing after December
31, 1995, and have had five or more years of experience shall have an
additional amount not exceeding statutory limits, added to their last year’s
salary as defined by the Barren County Administrative Code. This amount shall
be calculated at 30% of the value of each unused accumulated leave and sick
leave day computed from the employee’s current salary schedule. Retroactive to
January 1, 1997, in the case of employee death, 100% of earned, unused leave
and sick leave will be paid to said employee’s estate.
      (2)   An employee hired on or before the seventh of the month receives
one leave day for that month. If hired between the seventh and the twenty-
third, he or she will receive one-half day leave for that month. No time will
be accumulated if he or she is hired after the twenty-third.
      (3)   Part-time and temporary employees shall not earn leave time. Part-
time or temporary employees who are advanced to full-time employment shall
accumulate leave retroactive to the time of temporary employment not to exceed
three days if full-time hours were worked during the temporary period.
      (4)   Should an employee depart from his or her job on or prior to the
seventh of a calendar month, he or she shall not be credited with any leave for
that month; departing on the eighth of a calendar month of any day prior to and
including the fifteenth of that month, shall be credited with one- half day
leave; one departing on the sixteenth of a calendar month or any day thereafter
shall be credited with one full day leave.
      (5)   (a)   Sick leave shall be granted at eight hours for each month of
full-time employment. Sick leave shall be used for sickness of employee or
member of employee’s immediate family only. Certification shall be signed by
the employee and his or her supervisor that leave was taken for sickness of the
employee or member of employee’s immediate family.
         (b)   Use of sick leave for any purpose other than sick leave shall be
grounds for immediate suspension from the job without pay for the number of
days of abused sick leave and loss of all accumulated sick leave. Any
subsequent violation shall be grounds for immediate dismissal without appeal.
There shall be no limit to the accumulation of sick leave time. This division
(E)(5) shall become effective retroactive to January 1, 1996.
         (c)   Sick leave days may be only transferred between employees within
the same department, if employees agree to the transfer in writing and upon
approval of supervisor.
   (F)    Leave with pay may be authorized in order that employees may serve
required jury duty, military leave, or attend meetings of beneficial nature to
the county. The employee shall receive regular pay for an eight-hour day for
each day absent due to the circumstances named above in addition to the pay
received from the Court of Justice or Armed Forces for a period not to exceed
14 days (days not required to be consecutive). The supervisor and County Judge/
Executive must approve such leave in advance.
      (1)   A maximum of two working hours shall be granted to an employee who
requests it for time to vote.
      (2)   An employee shall be granted up to three paid working days off in
case of death in the immediate family. Immediate family shall include parents,
grandparents, spouse, brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren, step-family,
foster family, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and immediate in- laws. Pay for
each day of bereavement leave taken will be made at the employee’s current rate
of pay for a scheduled day’s work, not to exceed the hours for which the
employee is normally scheduled to work, or his or her average hours worked per
day (normal work week divided by five), whichever is greater. Any holidays or
days of administrative closing occurring during this time will be counted as
part of the bereavement leave and recorded as holiday(s) and/or day(s) of
administrative closing pay. If additional time off is needed, the employee may
request the use of sick time, accrued vacation, or leave without pay.
Bereavement leave time shall be included in the calculation of overtime.
   (G)   If an employee is hired 30 days or less after employment has been
terminated, he or she may be reinstated and his or her absence will be treated
as unpaid leave. The Fiscal Court will continue paying the normal contribution
to benefits during said leave time.
   (H)   (1)   All employees of the county who work full-time hours during the
pay period including a holiday may be absent from duty with full pay on the
following holidays: The following holiday schedule will be adjusted accordingly
to match the State of Kentucky’s calendar year dates.
         (a)   New Year’s Day: full day (eight hours);
         (b)   Martin Luther King Jr. Day: full day (eight hours);
         (c)   President’s Day: full day (eight hours);
         (d)   Good Friday: one half day (four hours);
         (e)   Memorial Day: full day (eight hours);
         (f)   Juneteenth: full day (eight hours);
         (g)   Independence Day: full day (eight hours);
         (h)   Labor Day: full day (eight hours);
         (i)   Veteran’s Day: full day (eight hours);
         (j)   Thanksgiving Day: full day (eight hours);
         (k)   Day after Thanksgiving: full day (eight hours);
         (l)   Christmas Eve: full day (eight hours);
         (m)   Christmas Day: full day (eight hours);
         (n)   New Years Eve; full day (eight hours); and
         (o)   New Years Day; full day (eight hours).
      (2)    Employees whose attendance is required at work on the days the
county observes for holidays shall receive double the corresponding number of
holiday hours in addition to the hours actually worked. When a holiday falls on
an employee’s regular day off, he or she shall be allowed equivalent time off
or the corresponding number of hours holiday pay. Holiday hours for employees
not working on the holiday shall not be included in the tabulation of overtime.
A holiday shall not count as a leave or sick leave day.
      (3)   These employees deemed to be non-exempt salary employees, under the
provisions of the federal and state wage and hours laws, may accrue
compensatory time at a rate of one and one-half times for work performed over
and above the hours worked in a normal workweek, up to a maximum of 160 hours.
Compensatory time accrued beyond these limits shall be forfeited.
         (a)   Law enforcement, fire protection, and emergency response
personnel, and Road Department personnel may accrue up to 480 hours of comp
time.
         (b)   An employee must be permitted to use comp time on the date
requested unless doing so would "unduly disrupt" the operations of the agency.
   (I)   Normally, wage earners will be required to work an eight-hour day and
a five-day week. A lunch break will be allowed without compensation.
Corrections Center personnel, Deputy Sheriffs, Parks and Recreation personnel,
and Road Department personnel will work on a schedule determined to be best
suited to the particular situation by the supervisor and approved by the County
Judge/Executive.
   (J)   When it is necessary for a person to be late or absent from work, he
or she shall notify his or her immediate supervisor of his or her whereabouts
and approximate time of return to work. An employee’s absence from work for
three consecutive work days without notification is considered a resignation
unless circumstances are such that it is impossible to give notice. Lateness or
absenteeism without just cause is sufficient reason for discipline in the way
of suspension or termination as determined by the supervisor.
   (K)   Each new employee will be on a temporary period for three months
following his or her date of employment. A person on a temporary period as a
new employee shall not be entitled to any grievance appeal. Temporary employees
shall not accumulate leave or sick leave time until their temporary period is
over, at which time their leave and sick leave time will be retroactive to the
date they were first employed.
   (L)   The amount paid an employee will be suggested by the supervisor, in
writing, and submitted by the County Judge/Executive to the Fiscal Court.
Salary level will depend on the employee’s level of education, skill required
by the job, previous experience, and quality of work performed.
   (M)    Necessary overtime work must be authorized by supervisors. Personnel
will be compensated by equivalent time off during the work week or by payment
during the work week or by payment of time and one-half for all hours worked
over 40 hours per week. The work week for all county offices will be the
calendar week.
   (N)   County employees will be covered by worker’s compensation insurance.
Any employee injured on the job will receive regular pay for the day of the
injury. Sick leave may be used for the days he or she is away from work. Once
sick leave is exhausted, leave time may be used.
   (O)   (1)   Full-time county employees may elect to participate in a
flexible benefits plan. The county will pay, as a pre-tax benefit under I.R.C.
§ 125, a specific dollar benefit via a cafeteria plan for the benefit of the
employee. The Fiscal Court shall, by budget resolution, set the monthly amount
on or before July 1 of each year. The Fiscal Court will continue paying the
normal contribution to the benefits package for temporarily laid-off employees
and employees on sick leave for a period not to exceed six months.
      (2)   An employee will be eligible for health insurance and any other
benefits 60 days after the date of employment. However, elected officials, the
County Road Supervisor, and the County Treasurer will be eligible for all
benefits immediately upon election or appointment.
      (3)   All full-time employees must participate in the county’s health
insurance group with the following exceptions:

   (P)   Full-time employees of the county must participate in the County
Employees Retirement System. Contributions will be deducted from wages and
placed in the Retirement Fund. Upon termination from county employment,
contributions may be withdrawn by an employee.
   (Q)   (1)   (a)   A supervisor may for good cause discipline an employee.
         (b)   Methods of discipline shall include, but not be limited to:

         (c)   The County Judge/Executive may intervene on behalf of the county
in cases where the supervisor has no knowledge of the infraction or does not
act in good faith.
      (2)   (a)    A supervisor may suspend an employee without pay for a
period not to exceed two weeks or 80 hours for disciplinary reasons. Notice of
suspension and reason for suspension shall be provided to the employee and to
the County Judge/Executive.
         (b)   A supervisor may demote an employee to a lower salary or wage, a
temporary or part-time position, and/or a less demanding position. Notice of
demotion shall be provided to the employee and to the County Judge/Executive.
         (c)   A supervisor may dismiss an employee for a severe infraction of
county policy, incompetence, or other undesirable behavior. Notice, along with
reasons for said action, shall be submitted to the County Judge/Executive for

giving the reason for their termination. This statement will be kept in the

§ 33.16 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (A)   It is the policy of the County Fiscal Court that sexual harassment of
employees is prohibited. The County Fiscal Court believes that every employee
has the right to a work environment free from sexual harassment. Any employee
found to have acted in violation of this policy will be subject to appropriate
disciplinary action, which may include termination.
   (B)   SEXUAL HARASSMENT includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors, sexually motivated physical contact, or other verbal or physical
conduct or communication of a sexual nature when:
      (1)   Submission to that conduct or communication is made a term or
condition, either explicitly or implicitly, of an individual’s employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of that conduct or communication by an
individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting that individual’s
employment;
      (3)   Conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s employment or creates an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive work environment, and the employer knows or should know
of the existence of the harassment and fails to take timely and appropriate
action; or
      (4)   Such conduct is based on sex and would have not occurred but for
the sex of the victim even though it is not clearly sexual in nature or an
explicit sexual advance.
   (C)   (1)   Any claims of sexual harassment should be reported to the
employee’s supervisor, the County Judge/Executive, or anyone else in a position
of authority at the County Fiscal Court. Any claims of sexual harassment or
violations of the sexual harassment policy will be reported to and investigated
by the County Judge/Executive, or his or her designee.
      (2)   If the facts appear to support the allegations of sexual harassment
or violation of this policy, disciplinary action, up to and including
termination, may result. All reports of harassment will be handled as
confidentially as possible by the County Fiscal Court.
      (3)   This policy applies to all county personnel while performing their
duties as employees within or outside the workplace.
(Ord. 313, passed 4-6-1999)

§ 33.18 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   Purpose. To establish a drug-free workplace program which will be in
compliance with 803 KAR 25.280, the governing administrative service regulation

   (C)   Policy statement.
      (1)   The County Fiscal Court is committed to providing a safe work
environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees as well
as all citizens of the county.
      (2)   Commitment is jeopardized when any employee uses alcohol or illegal
drugs on the job, comes to work under their influence, or possesses,
distributes, or sells drugs in the workplace. The goal of this section is to
balance respect for individual employees with the need to maintain a safe,
productive, and drug-free work environment; while helping to ensure the safety
of all citizens of the county and/or those people who may make use of the
county’s facilities. The intent of the policy is to offer assistance to those
who need it, while providing clear notice that the unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of alcohol or a controlled or
illicit drug in the workplace is incompatible with employment with the County
Fiscal Court.
      (3)   Therefore, the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation,
possession, or use of alcohol or a controlled or illicit drug is prohibited in

potential impact or special reporting due to legal or other concerns.
   (B)   Policy. Non-digital media contacting personal information shall be
physically controlled and securely stored in a manner meant to ensure that the
media cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals. This may require storing
media in locked containers such as cabinets, drawers, rooms, or similar
locations if unauthorized individuals. Such information must be protected by
software that prevents unauthorized individuals. Such information must be
protected by software that prevents unauthorized access. If personal
information is transmitted via e-mail or other electronic means, it must be
send using encryption mechanisms.

information is stored, or may be stored, designed, used or intended to be used
in multiple physical locations or capable of being used while traveling, such
as laptops, tablet computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), digital
cameras, portable telephones, and similar devices.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, all terms not otherwise defined are
used consistent with the definitions set forth in KRS 61.932.
   (D)   Point of contact. Every LGU shall designate a Point of Contact
("POC"). The POC shall serve the following functions:
      (1)   Maintain the LGU's adopted Information Security Policy and be
familiar with its requirements;
      (2)   Ensure the LGU's employees and others with access to personal
information are aware of and understand the Information Security Policy;
      (3)   Serve as contact for inquiries from other agencies regarding its
Information Security Policy and any incidents;
      (4)   Be responsible for ensuring compliance with the Information
Security Policy; and
      (5)   Be responsible for responding to any incidents.
   (E)   Software.
      (1)   Security software used to protect personal information must provide
user identification, authentication, data access controls, integrity, and audit
controls.
      (2)   Security software should be adequately tested to confirm
functionality and to ensure that it is minimally disruptive to all associated
operating systems, communications, applications, and other associated software
systems. Contractual provisions must also ensure that the supplier's software,
by design or configuration, will not introduce any security exposures.
      (3)   The level of protection afforded by security software should be
commensurate with the sensitivity of the data. For example, if data resides in
a database that is deemed highly confidential, stringent access controls to the
database should be employed. The level of protection along with the methods to
implement that protection should be addressed before any personal information
is stored on a device.
      (4)   Systems, networks and application software used to process personal
information must adhere to the highest level of protection reasonably
practical. LGU shall use Intrusion Detection and Prevention software approved
by COT. A list of approved software is available on the COT website. As an

of personal information on portable computing devices. However, users who in
the course of LGU business must place personal information on portable
computing devices must be made aware of the risks involved and impact to the
affected person/entities in the event of actual or suspected loss or disclosure
of personal information. If personal information is placed on a portable
computing device, reasonable efforts must be taken, including physical controls
and encryption, to protect the information from unauthorized access.
Additionally, each person using the portable computing device must sign a form
approved by the LGU indicating acceptance of the information and acknowledging
his/her understanding of the responsibility to protect the information. In the
event the portable computing device is lost or stolen, the LGU should be able
to accurately recreate the personal information and must be able to provide
notification to all affected persons/entities.
   (2)   When it is determined that personal information must be placed on a
portable computing device, every effort should be taken to minimize the amount
of information required. If possible, information should be abbreviated to
limit exposure (e.g., last four digits of the social security number).
   (I)   Physical security procedures.
      (1)   Given the broad variety of sizes and types of LGU, each will have
different security challenges and resources available to address those
challenges. This policy does not specifically address physical security needs
and threats, such as natural disasters, electrical outages, fire, or other
physical threats to personnel or information resources. LGU are responsible for
establishing and maintaining their own physical security procedures.
      (2)   The Information Security Policy adopted by an LGU shall include
provisions calculated to ensure that its information resources are protected by
physical security measures that address physical tampering, damage, theft, or
unauthorized physical access. Where applicable, the Information Security Policy
should address the circumstances under which identification badges must be worn
and establish parameters for access to restricted areas containing information
technology resources or other sources of personal information.
      (3)   When feasible, information technology equipment should be marked
with some form of identification that clearly indicates it is the property of
the LGU. During transport, media shall be protected and controlled outside of

to authorized personnel. Tracking methods shall be developed and deployed to
ensure media reaches its intended destination.
   (J)   Protection of personal information.
      (1)   LGU shall secure and, when applicable, appropriately dispose of
non-digital media. Non-digital media containing personal information must be
properly stored and secured from view by unauthorized persons.
      (2)   Secure measures must be employed by the LGU and all permissive
users to safeguard personal information contained on all LGU technology
resources.
      (3)   LGU shall ensure that all authorized personnel are familiar with
and comply with the Information Security Policy. LGU shall ensure that only
authorized personnel may hold and have access to personal information.
   (K)   Types of incidents. Threats to the security of personal information
arise in many different ways. LGU are encouraged to be aware of the different
types of threats and to enact reasonable measures to protect against each.
Attacks on personal information may arise from:
      (1)   External/removable media. an attack executed from removable media
(e.g. flash drive, CD) or a peripheral device.
      (2)   Attrition. An attack that employs brute force methods to
compromise, degrade, or destroy systems, networks, or services.

      (1)   A media retention schedule shall be defined for all media in
accordance with regulatory requirements. LGU are encouraged to adopt a
retention schedule consistent with the Kentucky Department of Libraries and
Archives General Records Retention Schedule for State Agencies.
      (2)   Every LGU shall have a document/information retention policy. When
records containing personal or confidential information are ready for
destruction, LGU shall destroy the information completely to ensure that the
information cannot be recognized or reconstructed. In addition, any personal or
confidential data contained on the computer media must be obliterated and/or
made indecipherable before disposing of the tape, diskette, CD-ROM, zip disk,
or other type of medium.
      (3)   Each LGU must provide appropriate methods and equipment to
routinely destroy personal or confidential information. The methods set forth
below are listed in priority order with the most highly recommended safeguard
listed first. One of the following safeguards must be implemented:
         (a)   Hire a document disposal contractor to dispose of the material.
The contractor should be certified by a recognized trade association and should
use disk sanitizing software and/or equipment approved by the United States
Department of Defense. The LGU should review and evaluate the disposal
company's information security policies and procedures. The LGU should review
an independent audit of a disposal company's operations and/or its compliance
with nationally recognized standards.
         (b)   Secure and utilize shredding equipment that performs cross-cut
or confetti patterns.
         (c)   Secure and utilize disk sanitizing or erasing software or
equipment approved by the United States Department of Defense. .
         (d)   Modify the information to make it unreadable, unusable or
indecipherable through any means.
   (M)   Reporting of incidents involving personal information.
      (1)   Each LGU must disclose a security breach in which personal
information is disclosed to, or obtained by, an unauthorized person.
Notification of the incident must be made in the most prompt and expedient
manner after the incident has been discovered. Within 35 days, a letter
notifying affected individuals of actual or suspected loss or disclosure of
personal information must be sent by the LGU describing the types of
information lost and recommended actions to be taken to mitigate the potential
misuse of their information.
      (2)   When a LGU identifies that a security breach has occurred in which
personal information has been disclosed to, or obtained by, an unauthorized
person, within three business days it shall notify Kentucky State Police, the
Auditor of Public Accounts, the Attorney General and the Commissioner of the
Department for Local Government and complete form COT-F012. The LGU shall
document the following:
         (a)   Preliminary reporting and description of the incident;
         (b)   Response, including evidence gathered;
         (c)   Final assessment and corrective action taken; and
         (d)   Final reporting.
      (3)   Incident response procedures can be a reaction to security
activities such as:
         (a)   Unauthorized access to personnel, data, or resources;
         (b)   Denial of service attacks;
         (c)   Actual or anticipated widespread malware infections;
         (d)   Data breaches;
         (e)   Loss/theft of equipment;
         (f)   Significant disruption of services; and
         (g)   Significant level of unauthorized scanning activity to or from
hosts on the network.
   (N)   Investigation. LGU shall make reasonable efforts to investigate any
security breaches in which personal information is disclosed to, or obtained
by, an unauthorized person and shall take appropriate corrective action.
   (O)   Disclosure communications. LGU must comply with all federal and state
laws and policies for information disclosure to media or the public. In some
circumstances, communication about an incident is necessary, such as contacting
law enforcement. LGU should use discretion in disclosing information about an
incident. Such information includes network information, type of incident,
specific infection type (if applicable), number of assets affected, specific
detail about applications affected, applications used to employ corrective
action/investigate, etc. LGU may proactively share relevant incident indicator
information with peers to improve detection and analysis of incidents. Within
the parameters of the law, minimal disclosure regarding incidents is preferred
to prevent unauthorized persons from acquiring sensitive information regarding
the incident, security protocols and similar matters, in an effort to avoid
additional disruption and financial loss.

requested for a commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the

require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract
shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a
specified fee.
      (3)   The fee provided for in division (B)(1) of this section may be
based on one or both of the following:

ANIMAL CONTROL
§ 90.01 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of the subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ABANDON OR ABANDONMENT. Leaving an animal for a period in excess of 24 hours
without the animal's owner, or the owner's designated caretaker, providing all
provisions of necessity as defined in this chapter and checking on the animal's
condition.
   ANIMAL. Any live, vertebrate, domestic creature, not including domestic or
feral cats and wildlife.
   ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER. An employee hired to enforce Animal Control laws and
regulations in Glasgow-Barren County.
   CRUELTY. Failing to provide adequate food and water; failing to detect the
need for or withholding veterinary care, creating or allowing unhealthful
living conditions, kicking, dragging, choking, causing pain/injury/death by the
use of an object or weapon, injury/death by means of caustic, flammable,
boiling or heated substances, causing suffering, injury or death by suffocation
or drowning; failure to provide health-related grooming. For purposes of this
chapter the definition of CRUELTY shall not include the acts as described in
KRS 525.130(2) and (3).
   LIVESTOCK. Horses, stallions, colts, geldings, mares, sheep, rams, lambs,
bulls, bullocks, steers, heifers, cows, calves, mules, jacks, jennets, burros,

wildlife (such as skunk, raccoons, opossums, groundhogs, beaver, deer and
squirrels), non-human primates, bears, wolves, coyotes, foxes, venomous
reptiles and any crossbreed of such animals which have similar characteristics
of the animals specified herein. In order to properly administer the provisions
of this section, the Barren County Fiscal Court may add to or remove from the
classification of non-domestic animal any bird, mammal, reptile (aquatic and
amphibious forms or other members of the animal's kingdom). Additions to the
list may be made only if the Barren County Fiscal Court determines, after
public hearing, that such species, because of habit mode of life or natural
instinct, is incapable of being domesticated, requires the exercise of art,
force or skill to keep them safely in subjection and would create a reasonable
likelihood of hazard to the public. Each determination by the legislative body
as to additions or deletions shall become effective when filed with the Barren
County Judge-Executive.
   OWNER. Any person having a right of property in the animal and every person
who keeps or harbors an animal or has the animal in their care, or any person
who permits the animal to remain on their premises, including premises they own
or occupy.

and a floor, which is dry and constructed of material which provides insulation
or the floor augmented with resting boards, and during inclement weather
extremes, said structure shall also include insulating bedding materials.
   TETHER. A rope or chain that is used to restrict an animal, so that it will
stay in a particular area. No tether shall weigh more than l/18th of the
animal's weight.
(Ord. 269, passed 7-16-1996; Am. Ord. 638, passed 5-19-2020)

or her dog or cat initially vaccinated by the age of four months and
revaccinated against rabies at the expiration of the immunization period as

   (F)   If a wild or exotic animal bites a human being or exhibits symptoms of
rabies, that animal shall be destroyed and tested for rabies pursuant to KRS
258.085.
   (G)   The owner of any animal quarantined or tested under this section shall
be liable for any expenses incurred as a result of the quarantine or testing.
Any owner who destroys or disposes of an animal that has bitten a human being
shall be liable for any rabies post-exposure treatment if the destruction or
disposal occurs in a manner that does not allow for rabies testing or
quarantine pursuant to KRS 258.085.
   (H)   Service animals, as defined in KRS 525.010 and service animals in

   No person shall abandon any animal, as defined in §
90.01. In the event that an animal is found so abandoned, such animal may be
taken by a Glasgow-Barren County Animal Control Officer or peace officer and
impounded in a shelter, and there confined in a humane manner. Such animal, if
taken from private property, shall be kept for not less than the prescribed
period in accordance with the procedures set forth in the impoundment section
of this chapter. In the event that an animal is so abandoned, the owner or
keeper, if any, whom the officer has charged with the animal's care, shall be
subject to a citation for abandonment.

barking between 9:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., or a hazard to persons or property.
(Ord. 269, passed 7-16-1996)
§ 90.07 DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED ANIMAL.
   Any adult dog of unknown ownership picked up and impounded by an Animal
Control officer or turned in by a citizen shall be kept for a minimum of five
days, during which time the animal may be reclaimed by the owner and the animal
shall be licensed. If the animal is not claimed within that time, the animal
shall become the property of BRAWA and may be destroyed in a human manner or
offered for adoption. The five-day holding period shall not apply to the
disposition of sick or hurt animals where the owner is not known or can not be
located. Animals may be euthanized at any time to prevent suffering or to
protect the health and safety of the other animals at BRAWA. Animals
surrendered to BRAWA by the owner may be offered for adoption immediately.

be incurred until first trying to locate the owner of the animal and advising
the owner of the animal's injury. The owner may elect to decline veterinary
care.
(Ord. 269, passed 7-16-1996; Am. Ord. 638, passed 5-19-2020)
§ 90.09 HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS.
   No owner shall fail to provide food, water, shelter or veterinary care to
prevent suffering and humane care and treatment to their dog or cat. Any owner

the lien and the regularity of the proceedings pursuant to this statute, and
shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk. The lien shall be notice
to all persons from the time of its recording and shall bear interest
thereafter until paid. The lien created shall take precedence over all other
liens, except state, county, school board, and city taxes, except as provided
in division (F) of this section. The lien may be enforced by judicial
proceeding.
   (F)   The lien provided in division (E) of this section shall not take
precedence or priority over a previously recorded lien if:
      (1)   The county failed to provide the lien holder a copy of the
determination in accordance with division (G); or

attached pursuant to this section shall be personally liable for the amount of
the lien, including all interest, civil penalties, and other charges and the
county may bring a civil action against the owner and shall have the same
remedies as provided for the recovery of debt owed. The failure of the county
to comply with division (G), and the failure of a lien to take precedence over
previously filed liens as provided in division (F), shall not limit or restrict
any remedies that the county has against the owner of the property.
   (I)   This chapter may also be enforced by criminal penalty. The County
Judge Executive or his/her designee may seek a criminal summons for violations
under this chapter. The criminal penalty for non-compliance of this chapter is

as shall be appropriate and in accordance with law.
   (C)   All executive departments and agencies shall administer their programs

(Ord. 175, passed 10-7-1992)
§ 93.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he or she will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter “person
aggrieved”) may file a complaint with the chief executive officer. Complaints
shall be in writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as
the chief executive officer requires. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the
chief executive officer shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or
persons who allegedly committed or who is/are about to commit the alleged
discriminatory housing practice. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or
within 30 days after the expiration of any period of reference under division
(C) below, the chief executive officer shall investigate the complaint and give
notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he or she intends to resolve
it. If the chief executive officer decides to resolve the complaints, he or she
shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing
practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.
Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made
public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter
without the written consent of the persons concerned.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) above shall be filed within 180 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be
in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint
against him or her and with the leave of the chief executive officer, which
shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, and may
amend his or her answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be
verified.
   (C)   If within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the chief executive
officer, the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance with this chapter, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days
thereafter, file a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The chief executive officer will assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance within 30 days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30
days hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, and to enforce the rights granted or
protected by this chapter, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the
complaint. If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has
occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from
engaging in such practice or order such affirmative action as may be
appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
chief executive officer shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain
voluntary compliance.
(Ord. 175, passed 10-7-1992) Penalty, see §
93.99
§ 93.11 INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENAS; GIVING OF EVIDENCE.
   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the chief executive officer shall have
access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals,
and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and
copy such materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such
persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation;
provided, however, that the chief executive officer first complies with the
provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and
seizures. The chief executive officer may issue subpoenas to compel his or her
access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such
persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and
subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or
interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the district in which the investigation is taking place. The
chief executive officer may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the chief executive officer, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by, and
in the name of the chief executive officer to the same extent and subject to
the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the chief executive officer himself
or herself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their
face the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were
issued at his or her request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the chief executive officer shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in U.S. District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena
issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the chief executive officer to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The chief executive officer shall grant the petition if he or she
finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable
time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to
any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly
onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the chief
executive officer or other person at whose request it was issued may petition
for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which
the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts
business.
   (F)   The County Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the chief
executive officer participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this
chapter.

93.03,
93.04,
93.05, and
93.06 may be enforced by civil actions in state or local courts of general
jurisdiction.
      (2)   A civil action shall be commenced within 180 days after the alleged
discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that the court
shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or §
93.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the chief executive officers are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice
complained of in the complaint made to the chief executive officer and which
practice forms the basis for the action in court; and provided, however, that
any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court
order issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fide
purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of
the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter
shall not be affected.
   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of
a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the said plaintiff, in the opinion of
the court, is not financially able to assume said attorney’s fees.

§ 110.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the county, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations
relating to sexually-oriented businesses. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented materials,
but to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects
of sexually-oriented businesses. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect
of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented
materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually-oriented entertainment to their
intended market.
      (2)   However, neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and the Fiscal Court
recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene
materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce
state obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the county.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in reports made available to the
Fiscal Court, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v.
Play Time Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young vs. American Mini-
Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to:
Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the
report of the Attorney General’s Working Group on the regulation of sexually-
oriented businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Fiscal Court finds
the following.
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually-oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts occur at sexually-oriented businesses, especially those
which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films,
videos, or live sex shows. Offering and providing such space encourages such
activities which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually-oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually-oriented businesses.
      (5)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually- oriented businesses, including but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, non-A amebiasis, non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections,
and shigella infections.
      (6)   There has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of
AIDS caused by the HIV virus in the United States. Through December 31, 1997,
there have been 619,690 reported cases of AIDS in the United States. As of
December 31, 1997, there have been 2,583 reported cases of AIDS in
commonwealth.
      (7)   The U.S. Surgeon General in his report of October 22, 1986, advised
the U.S. public that AIDS and HIV infections may be transmitted through sexual
contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood
components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
      (8)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities
and maintain those facilities.
      (9)   Children, the family environment, and residential neighborhoods
suffer injury from the deleterious effects and harmful consequences resulting
from the distribution of, and exposure to, certain sexually-explicit materials.
This is particularly so when such material is permitted to leave a business’
premises and enter the immediate family environment, neighborhood, and certain
areas where children are likely to be.
      (10)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(9) above raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (11)   Sexually-oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (12)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (13)   The general welfare, health, and safety of the citizens of the
county will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

wine, the regulatory license fee shall be 5% of gross sales. The regulatory
license fee shall be 5% on gross retail sales of package malt beverages.

the cost of any additional policing, regulatory, or administrative expense
related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the county. Should the county
fail to address the regulatory license fee in any budget, men the regulatory
license fee shall remain at the level at which it was last fixed in this ABC
Ordinance until such time as the County Fiscal court shall adjust the fee.)

Administrator, who shall transmit all fees to the County Clerk, or his
designee, for deposit into the appropriate designated account. The County may

additional policing, regulatory or administrative expenses related to the sale
of alcoholic beverages in the County. The regulatory license fee shall be in
addition to any other fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit
against a regulatory license fee in the County shall be allowed in an amount
equal to any license fee shall be based on paperwork required by the local and/
or state ABC Administrator, which may include but is not limited to tax returns
and financial statements. Said paperwork and payment will be due according to
the schedule set forth by the County ABC Administrator, or his designee, which
may be set at but is not limited to, time periods consisting of a monthly or
quarterly billing by the local ABC office and/or the County.
      (3)   Failure to pay such remittance within ten days of the due date
constitutes a violation and shall subject a licensee to suspension or
revocation.
      (4)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay remittance by the due
date is 5% of the regulatory fee for each 90 days or fraction thereof. The
total late filing penalty shall not exceed 25% of the regulatory fee; provided,
however, that in no case shall the penalty be less than $10.

payments.
   (I)   Disposition of fees and any other type of payment to the County. The
County ABC Administrator shall transmit all fees and any other types of payment

      (4)   In addition to the above specified information, the applicant shall
file, with the application, responses to any additional questions as may be
posed or prescribed by the County ABC Administrator. The County Fiscal court
has adopted a statement of guidelines and priorities for the issuance of
licenses within this chapter to determine the extent to which applications may

to the information contained in the application, the County ABC Administrator
may require such other information as the Administrator may, in his or her
discretion, deem desirable, reasonable, or appropriate to the consideration of
the application.
   (D)   Other conditions. In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or
considerations required or permitted by law:
      (1)   The County ABC Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage

nor may any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or
property, owed and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any of the
above delinquent payments due and owing to the County. Further, if a licensee
becomes delinquent in the payment of any of the above at any time during the
license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be subject
to revocation or suspension.
      (4)   No person, whether applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in
any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the
County ABC Administrator, or any member of the County's staff, or any state ABC
Administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This division is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a county or state ABC
Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a

      (7)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a property
or vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to law.
   (F)   Change of information.
      (1)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the County ABC Administrator with ten days of the change.
      (2)   Since a number of licenses issued by the county are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the County ABC Administrator. The
County ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
      (3)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other
business organization herein, the word "change" is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the

the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than 10% of the total
ownership or stock shall require a new license.

         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in
any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license in any other state or province.
      (5)   This information shall be filed with the County ABC Administrator
as a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten days of any change of required
information.
   (G)   Renewal of license.
      (1)   Every year, except in the case of the temporary licenses, each
licensee shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the
County ABC Administrator no less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the
license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except
where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises
licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act
of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the
premises by any federal, state, county or other governmental agency or private
organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
exiting lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less man 20 days from the expiration date of the license, setting
forth these facts, and the County ABC Administrator is hereby authorized to
extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a reasonable length
of time within the sound discretion of the County ABC Administrator; provided,
however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from the expiration date of the
former license or licenses. Said license fee shall not by payable until
application is made for the transfer of said license to a new location.
      (2)   The renewal by the County ABC Administrator of the license shall
not be construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred
prior to such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the
licensee.
   (H)   Lost or destroyed license. When a license shall be lost or destroyed
without fault on the part of the licensee or his or her agent or employee, a
duplicate in lieu of the original license shall be issued by the County ABC
Administrator after the Administrator shall have been satisfied as to the
facts; provided, however, that the applicant for said duplicate license shall
pay a fee of $10 for the duplicate license.
   (I)   Revocation or suspension.
      (1)   Any license may be revoked or suspended by the County ABC
Administrator if the licensee shall have violated any of other provisions of
KRS Chs. 241 through 244, or any rule or regulation of the ABC Board, or of the
Kentucky Department of Revenue, relating to the regulation of the manufacture,
sale, and transportation, or taxation, of alcoholic beverages or if such
licensee shall have violated or shall violate any act of Congress or any rule
or regulation of any federal board, agency or commission, or this chapter now,
heretofore, or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the
manufacture, sale, and transportation, or taxation, of intoxicating liquors, or
any rules or regulations of the county heretofore in existence or authorized by
the terms of KRS Chs. 241 through 244 to be created, irrespective of whether
the licensee knew of or permitted the violation or whether the violation was
committed is disobedience of his or her instructions, or any such license may
be revoked or suspended for any cause which the County ABC Administrator in the
exercise of his or her sound discretion deems sufficient.

County ABC Administrator would have been required to refuse a-license if the
facts had been known.

revoked or suspended for the following causes:
         (a)   Conviction of the licensee or his or her agent or employee for
selling any illegal beverages on the premises licensed.
         (b)   Making any false, material statements in an application for a
license.
         (c)   If within a period of two consecutive years, any licensee or any
clerk, servant, agent or employee of the licensee shall have been convicted of
two violations of the terras and provisions of KRS Chs. 241 through 244 or any
act heretofore or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the
manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages or if within such
period, any licensee or any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the license
shall have twice been convicted of any felony or of any misdemeanor directly or
indirectly attributable to the use of alcoholic beverages, or of one such
felony and one such misdemeanor.
   (d)   Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee to pay an
excise tax or any part thereof, or any penalties imposed by or under the
provisions of any statutes, this chapter, or acts of Congress relative to

opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or

claimed.
      (2)   A decision of the County ABC Administrator revoking or suspending a
license may be appealed as provided in KRS 241.140 and §
112.03.
      (3)   Within three days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the County ABC Administrator. If the revoked or
suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of
Police, at the request of the County ABC Administrator, shall immediately cause
one of his or her officers to take physical possession of the license and
return it to the County ABC Administrator.
      (4)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee
may, with prior approval of the County ABC Administrator, dispose of and
transfer his or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
      (5)   Appeal from the decision of the County ABC Administrator revoking
or suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing of an
appeal shall stay any penalty imposed by the order until conclusion of the

      (1)   The County ABC Administrator may refuse to issue a license for any
of the following reasons:
         (a)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for
suspension or revocation of a county license shall be the same as provided for
state licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as
violation of any county ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales
or the administration thereof.
         (b)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of
license would be authorized under local, state, or federal law; or
         (c)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
      (2)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the County ABC
Administrator may appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KRS 241.140
and §
112.03.
   (M)   Review of license; books, records and reports.
      (1)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter
shall provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions
of any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicant's business income is earned from the sale
of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated
with the applicant's quarterly regulatory fee filings. The county shall provide
the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identity each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of
food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for
filing of reports notwithstanding, the county may at any time come upon the
premises of any licensee and examine the books and records to determine whether
the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this chapter. In the event the
conditions of any license requirement are not met during any particular
quarter, the County ABC Administrator shall have discretion in determining
whether revocation is appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a
reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is
demonstrated by the licensee, the County ABC Administrator may apply an
accounting period of at least one year in determining whether or not the food
sale percentage requirement has been met.
      (2)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain, upon the
licensed premises, adequate books and records of all transactions involved in
the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the County ABC Administrator and such county
employees who may assist the County ABC Administrator in his or her review.
      (3)   For the purpose of assisting the County ABC Administrator in
enforcement of this chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC Board
under KRS 243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the County ABC
Administrator. Copies of any and all reports and correspondences to the ABC
Board required by statute shall be furnished to the County ABC Administrator.
   (N)   Dormancy.
      (1)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after 90 days. Such is the intent of this section.
Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her business
interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various exceptions to
the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
      (2)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period
of 90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in
division (N)(3) are proved to the satisfaction of the County ABC Administrator,
the license shall be surrendered to the County ABC Administrator. If the
license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the County ABC
Administrator.
      (3)   The provisions of division (N)(2) shall not apply to any licensee
who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a license is
issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of
the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency under
power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or
loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the
expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to the County
ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the fact that the licensee
is unable to continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set forth
herein, and the County ABC Administrator may grant an extension of the dormancy
with the license continuing to remain in effect during the license period or
until same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no
business is transacted during said period; provided, however, no such license
shall be considered valid unless business is conducted there under within 12
months from the date of notice to the County ABC Administrator. Such extension
may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be for such times as the County
ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of his or her sound discretion.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES
§ 150.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The Legislature of the commonwealth has in KRS 67.084 delegated to
local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
   (B)   Therefore, the County Fiscal Court, hereby adopts this chapter.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010)
§ 150.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010)
§ 150.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010)
§ 150.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines; and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010)
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.15 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A1-30 and AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood 100-year flood. Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   A99 ZONE. Part of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) inundated by the 100-
year flood which is to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood
protection system under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principle source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to structures. Areas of a 100-year flood, base flood elevations, and
flood hazard factors are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A ZONES. Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process  of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three
feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD). BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate
map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and AR/
AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a
1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally above ground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other human-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for STRUCTURE.
   C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES. Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA).
      (1)   An area that has been determined by the Floodplain Administrator
(or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from

of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source,
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See MUDSLIDES.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See FLOOD-
RELATED EROSION.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.

community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state, and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOOD-PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOOD-PROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a nonresidential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. The area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory
floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/
or hydrologic analysis.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in § 150.24, means that the variance
granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining
this requirement, the Fiscal Court will consider the fact that every newly
constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of
the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In
addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject
to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance
rates.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, (i.e., county or municipality)
that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possibly adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, or flood routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).
      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, flood-proof, demolish,
or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and nonresidential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE (KRS) 151.250. Plans for dams, levees, and the like
to be approved and permit issued by Cabinet - (Environmental and Public
Protection Cabinet).
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county, or other political subdivision of the commonwealth, including levee
districts, drainage districts, flood control districts, or systems, or similar
bodies, shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation, or
improvement of any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill, or other
obstruction (except those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or
along any stream, or in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and
specifications for such work have been submitted by the person or political
subdivision responsible for the construction, reconstruction, or improvement
and such plans and specifications have been approved in writing by the Cabinet
and a permit issued. However, the Cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams,
embankments, or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to
require approval by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water
supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
commonwealth shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris, or any
other material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a
building, barrier, or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a
river or stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising,
or obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in
the floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have
been submitted to and approved by the Cabinet and a permit issued as required
in division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the Cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance, or operation of any drainage district, ditch, or
system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the
same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by
the Cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water
resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control
thereof so notified. The Department for Natural Resources, KRS Ch. 350, shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Ch. 151 concerning the regulation of dams,
levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across or
along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Ch. 350 for surface coal mining operations.

constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM.
      (1)   A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
      (2)   For a LEVEE SYSTEM to be recognized, the following criteria must be
met.
         (a)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
         (b)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or
state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a
community participating in the NFIP.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.

or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion
of construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or
landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure’s foundation
system.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including a
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area

not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required utilities. The
term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable
structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to
be improved property. The term MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a
“recreational vehicle”. (See RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.)

(FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter
suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.
(The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL). The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on a community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) 1929 or NORTH
AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD) 1988.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of
disaster response and recovery.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW). Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a
dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water
on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the MUDFLOW, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including but  not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.

of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal Program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRMs. Refer to
FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of the county’s floodplain management
regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the county’s adopted floodplain management ordinances.
   NONRESIDENTIAL. Structures that are not designed for human habitation,
including but is not limited to: small business concerns, churches, schools,
farm structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses,
recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial
structures, warehouses, and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less
than a six-month duration.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD). As corrected in 1988, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRMs and Digitally Referenced FIRMs
(DFIRMs).) (Refer to FIRM or DFTRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across, or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard, or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD). (See BASE FLOOD.) The flood that
has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any
flood zone that begins with the letter ‘A’ is subject to the 100-year flood.
Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26% chance of experiencing such a
flood with the SFHA.
   PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY. A community that voluntarily elects to participate
in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that
are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.
   POST-FIRM CONSTRUCTION. Construction or substantial improvement that started
on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community or after
December 31, 1974, whichever is later.

§ 150.16 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas (SFHA), areas
applicable to KRS 151.250 and, as determined by the Floodplain Administrator or
other delegated, designated, or qualified community official as determined by
the County Fiscal Court from available technical studies, historical
information, and other available and reliable sources, and areas within the
jurisdiction of the County Fiscal Court which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the citizens of the county.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010)
§ 150.17 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) for the county,
dated May 3, 2011, with the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs),
other supporting data, and any subsequent amendments thereto, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. This FIS
and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and
may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of
this chapter and which are recommended to the Fiscal Court by the Floodplain
Administrator and are enacted by the Fiscal Court pursuant to statutes
governing land use management regulations. The FIS and/or FIRM are permanent
records of the county and are on file and available for review by the public
during regular business hours at the County Government Center.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010)
§ 150.18 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (A)   A development permit shall be required in conformance with the
provision of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in the special flood hazard areas (SFHA). See §
150.41 for instructions and explanation.
   (B)   Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010)

§ 150.22 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the County Fiscal Court, any officer
or employee, the commonwealth, the Federal Insurance Administration, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, thereof for any flood damage that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010)
§ 150.23 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION, AND NOTICE.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and
any approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly-authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly- authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall
issue a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property
owner, stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this
chapter and/or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is
to be remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or
with the approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to
occur, which period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the
nature of the violation, and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard.
The remedy may include an order to stop-work on the development. The notice
shall also state that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the
requested remedies and collective actions are not taken, which citation will
request a civil monetary fine, and shall state the maximum fine which could be
imposed. See §
150.99.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly-authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly- authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue
a citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, within what period of
time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are recommended.
When a citation is issued, the person to whom the citation is issued shall
respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation is issued by
either carrying out the remedies and collections set forth in the citation,
paying the civil fine set forth in the citation, or requesting a hearing before
the governing body. If the person to whom the citation is issued does not
respond to the citation within seven days, that person shall be deemed to have
waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a violation occurred
shall be considered final.

§ 150.24 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Nature of variance.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principles of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the Fiscal Court to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare.
The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be
met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that
must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are
designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a
variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The County Fiscal Court
shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of members of the Fiscal Court.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local Circuit Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the Fiscal Court need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Fiscal Court believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
150.15, under “public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in §
150.15), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of divisions (D)(1)
through (D)(11) above are satisfied and that the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a
public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
and
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see §
150.15 ) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010)
§ 150.25 COUNTY AS MEMBER OF FEDERAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.
   (A)   The county assures the Federal Insurance Administration that it will
enact as necessary, and maintain in force in those areas having flood, mudslide
(i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazards, adequate land use, and
control measures with effective enforcement provisions consistent with the
criteria set forth in § 1910 of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations.
   (B)   The county vests the Judge/Executive with the responsibility,
authority, and means to:
      (1)   Assist the Administrator, at his or her or her request, in his or
her delineation of the limits of the area having special flood, mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazards;
      (2)   Provide such information as the Administrator may request
concerning present uses and occupancy of the floodplain, mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow), or flood-related erosion areas;
      (3)   Cooperate with federal, state, and local agencies and private firms
which undertake to study, survey, map, and identify floodplain, mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow), or flood-related erosion areas, and cooperate with neighboring
communities with respect to management of adjoining floodplain, mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow), and/or flood-related erosion areas in order to prevent aggravation of
existing hazards;
      (4)   Submit on the anniversary date of the community’s initial
eligibility an annual report to the Administrator on the progress made during
the past year within the community in the development and implementation of
floodplain management measures; and
      (5)   (a)   Upon occurrence, notify the Administrator in writing whenever
the boundaries of the community have been modified by annexation or the
community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area.
         (b)   In order that all flood hazard boundary maps and flood insurance
rate maps accurately represent the community’s boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the community suitable for reproduction,
clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for which the
community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.
   (C)   The county appoints the County Building Inspector to maintain for
public inspection and to furnish upon request, for the determination of
applicable flood insurance risk premium rates within all areas having special
flood hazards identified on a flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate
map, any certificates of flood-proofing, and information on the elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) of the level of the lowest habitable floor
(including basement if habitable) of all new or substantially improved
structures, and he or she shall include whether or not such structures contain
a basement, if the structure has been flood-proofed, and the elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was flood-proofed.
   (D)   The county agrees to take such other official action as may be
reasonably necessary to carry out the objectives of the program.

§ 150.56 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
150.17, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower
than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with
standards of division (C) below:
      (1)   In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified;
      (2)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, and
best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced.
Title 401 KAR Ch. 4, Regulation 060, states as a part of the technical
requirements for a state floodplain permit: The applicant shall provide cross
sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby base flood
elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall
have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross
sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant
breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base
floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base
floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the
Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur,
the Cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations
which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway
boundary calculations;
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation; and
      (4)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure
(including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) above or together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities:

base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood
elevation;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B)(4) are satisfied. Such certification shall
be provided to the official as set forth in §
150.41(B)(1)(c);
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) below;
and
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation two feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less

coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood
elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to
allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator).

         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (3)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the
manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.

licensed and insured in accordance with the commonwealth’s motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
150.17 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; and
      (2)   If this division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
150.55 through
150.61.
(Ord. 499, passed 12-7-2010; Ord. 499, passed 8-19-2014)
§ 150.57 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
