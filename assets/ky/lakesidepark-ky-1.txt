offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance
takes effect, except that the proceedings hereafter had shall conform, so far
as practicable, to the laws in force at the time of such proceedings. If any
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment is mitigated by any provision of the new
ordinance, such provision may, by the consent of the part affected, be applied
to any judgment pronounced after the new ordinance takes effect.

§ 10.007 ORDINANCES AFFECTED BY CODIFICATION

codes pertaining to the titles or subjects contained herein shall be deemed
repealed.
   (B)   All standard codes, rules, and regulations and other subject matter
adopted by ordinance and herein incorporated by reference, together with any
amendments as made from time to time, and future incorporations by reference

copy of such codes, rules, and regulations shall be kept on file in the office
of the City Clerk/Treasurer, unless otherwise indicated.
   (C)   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature and any other
ordinances not pertaining to titles and subjects included in this code shall

implication.
   (D)   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
council, or a certain city officer, employee, or agent to make additional
ordinances, rules, or regulations for the purposes of carrying out the intent
of the ordinance, all ordinances, rules, and regulations of a similar nature
serving the same purpose, effected prior to the adoption of this code and not
inconsistent with this code, shall remain in effect.
§ 10.008 CONFLICTING SECTIONS OR PROVISIONS
   If any of the provisions, codes, chapters, articles, divisions, or sections
of this code conflict with or contradict another provision, code, chapter,
article, division, or section, the provisions with the latest date of enactment
or adoption shall prevail. If the conflicting provisions bear the same date of
enactment or adoption, the conflict shall be so construed as to be consistent
with the meaning or legal effect of the subject matter when taken as a whole.
§ 10.009 OMISSIONS OR ERRORS
   If an error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any word or
words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intent of the
provisions, or the use of a word for which a meaning within the intent of the
provision cannot be defined, or the use of a word or words when another word or
words was clearly intended, the error shall be corrected by substituting a
correct spelling of the word or words, or adding the omitted word or words, or
deleting the word or words found to be in error to conform with the original
intent of the provision. The provision shall have the same force and effect as
though the correct words were originally contained within the text of this
code. No alteration shall be made if any question exists regarding the nature
or extent of the error.
§ 10.010 HISTORICAL REFERENCES
   (A)   All reference information contained within this code is intended for
the use of the reader; however, it shall not be construed to be a part of any
ordinance or amendment to any ordinance codified herein.
   (B)   As an historical reference to the sections contained within this code,
ordinance information before the passage of ordinance number 7-1985 adopted on
November 11, 1985, was extracted from the code originally adopted on December
18, 1985, and as amended and supplemented from time to time. Wherever possible,
ordinance historical data has been included as originally codified or contained
within the 1985 code; but, when section or provision history could not be
determined from the 1985 code, a section reference to the code has been added.
Example: (1985 Code).
   (C)   All amendments to ordinances are listed following previous ordinance
information as an amendment to the previous ordinance. Example: (Ord. 4-1986,
passed 10-13-86; Am. Ord. 9-1987, passed 10-12-87).
   (D)   If a cite to the Kentucky Revised Statutes is included in the history
of a provision or section, this indicates that the text of the section reads
word-for-word from the statutes. Example: (KRS 446.010). If a cite from the
Kentucky Revised Statutes is set forth as a “statutory reference” following the
text of the section, this indicates that additional information may be found
within the reference section of the statutes.
   (E)   Cross references which are found at the end of any provision or
section refer to another section of the code where additional information about
a particular subject may be found.
   (F)   Where additional information of some nature is required or provided
that cannot otherwise be explained or corrected, or when a question of
completeness or correction has arisen in the publication of this code that
cannot otherwise be completed or corrected before publication of this code, a
footnote, numbered and set out at the end of the page, shall provide
explanation of the additional information, correction, or question.
   (G)   Sections with no historical reference or data indicate that the
section is originally enacted by the adoption of this code.
§ 10.011 TITLES, ARTICLES, DIVISION, AND SECTION HEADINGS
   The catchlines or headings of all titles, articles, divisions, and sections,
or other provisions of this code printed in italicized type, bold type, or
which are capitalized are intended as words to indicate the contents of the
sections and shall not be deemed to be titles of the sections, nor a part of
the sections, unless so provided by the ordinance from which the sections were
derived.
§ 10.012 REFERENCES TO CODE
   All references to chapters, articles, divisions, subchapters, or sections
contained within the provisions of this code are to the chapters, articles,
divisions, subchapters, or sections of this code, unless otherwise specified.
§ 10.999 GENERAL PENALTY
   When any person, firm, or corporation is convicted of a violation of any
provision of this code and no penalty is otherwise provided, the person, firm,
or corporation shall be deemed guilty of a violation and shall be fined in an
amount not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).

ARTICLE II. PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 23.100 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION
   (A)   As defined in §
23.001, and subject to the limitations set forth in §
23.107, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a request or complete a written application for such records at the
office of the City Clerk/Treasurer during regular office hours, except during
legal holidays. The application shall be hand-delivered, mailed, or sent via
facsimile to the City Clerk/Treasurer’s office.
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in compliance
with the open records law and the requested records are immediately available,
the custodian shall deliver the records for inspection. Suitable facilities
shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk/Treasurer for the
inspection. No person shall remove original copies of public records from the
offices of any public agency without the written permission of the official
custodian of the record.
   (C)   An applicant may inspect public records during the regular business
hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from the city
through the mail if the applicant’s residence or principal place of business is
outside of the county in which the city is located and he has precisely
described public records which are available within the city. If the person
requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed, the official
custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of
mailing.
   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
23.001.
   (E)   Non-exempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Non-exempt public records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copies in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than 8 ½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requester’s requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of non-exempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of non-exempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requester stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requester to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing, and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requester was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section; or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio, or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly
allowed the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of
its publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission
for that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874(5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic format, as provided
under this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).

the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General’s opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.

ARTICLE III. BUSINESS TAXATION
§ 60.030 LEVY AND IMPOSITION
   For the purpose of providing funds for the general operating expenses of the
city and the municipal services and functions provided thereby, and subject to
the provisions of KRS 67.750 through 67.795, and except as provided in §
60.012, an occupational license fee is hereby levied and imposed upon everybody
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other businesses in
the city, for the privilege of that engagement.
(Ord. 12-2007, passed 12-19-07)
§ 60.031 RATE
   The occupational license fee that is levied and imposed by this chapter is
at the rate of:
   (A)   Employees. One percent (1%) of all compensation earned by an employee
for labor, work or services provided in the city.
   (B)   Those not employees. Seventy-five thousands (0.0075) of the taxable
gross receipts of everybody, other than employees, who is engaged in any
franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business in the city.
(Ord. 12-2007, passed 12-19-07)
§ 60.032 APPORTIONMENT OF GROSS RECEIPTS
   Pursuant to the authority of KRS 67.753(4), it is hereby determined that the
apportionment provisions of KRS 67.753 do not fairly represent the extent of
the engagement in the city of those, other than employees, who are engaged in
any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business both within and
outside of the city; and, accordingly, the following described property factor
is hereby added to the payroll factor and the sales factor provided in KRS
67.753 for the apportionment of the gross receipts of those, other than
employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business both within and outside of the city.
   (A)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or
rented or used in the city during the computation period, and the denominator
of which is the average value of all of the taxpayer's real and tangible
personal property owned or rented and used anywhere during the computation
period. In the determination of the property factor:
      (1)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.
Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight (8) times the net annual
rental rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any
annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub-rentals.
      (2)   The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the
values at the beginning and ending of the computation period, but the City
Administrative Officer may require the averaging of monthly values during the
computation period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value
of the taxpayer's property.
   (B)   The proportion of the total gross receipts everywhere of those, other
than employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession
or other business both within and outside of the city that are subject to the
occupational license fee established by this chapter, shall be determined by
