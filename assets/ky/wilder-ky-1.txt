of the improvement. The lien takes precedence over all other liens, whether
created prior to or subsequent to the publication of the ordinance, except a

apportioned to any other property, or any other change may be made without such
compliance if all property owners of the improvement consent.

§ 33A.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)   All public records shall be open for inspection by any resident of the
Commonwealth, except as otherwise provided by KRS 61.870 to 61.884, and
suitable facilities shall be made available by each public agency for the
exercise of this right. No resident of the Commonwealth shall remove original
copies of public records from the offices of any public agency without the
written permission of the official custodian of the record.
(KRS 61.872(1))
   (B)   (1)   Any resident of the Commonwealth shall have the right to inspect
public records. The official custodian may require a written application,
signed by the applicant and with his name printed legibly on the application,
describing the records to be inspected. The official custodian may require the
applicant to provide a statement in the written application of the manner in
which the applicant is a resident of the Commonwealth under paragraphs (1) to
(6) of definition of “RESIDENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH” in §
33A.01 .
      (2)   The written application shall be:
         (a)   Hand delivered;
         (b)   Mailed;
         (c)   Sent via facsimile; or
         (d)   Sent via e-mail to the public agency’s official custodian of
public records or his or her designee at the e-mail address designated in the
public agency's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to KRS 61.876.
      (3)   A public agency shall not require the use of any particular form
for the submission of an open records request, but shall accept for any request
the standardized form developed under KRS 61.876(4).
(KRS 61.872(2))
   (C)   A resident of the Commonwealth may inspect the public records:
      (1)   During the regular office hours of the public agency; or
      (2)   By receiving copies of the public records from the public agency
through the mail. The public agency shall mail copies of the public records to
a person whose residence or principal place of business is outside the county
in which the public records are located after he precisely describes the public
records which are readily available within the public agency. If the resident
of the Commonwealth requesting the public records requests that copies of the
records be mailed, the official custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of
all fees and the cost of mailing.
(KRS 61.872(3))
   (D) The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public
records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this
chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request
and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
33A.01.
(KRS 61.874(1))
   (E) Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public records
used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy format
where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
   (F) The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not less
than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor’s requirements, the public records may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(1))
   (G) Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure of
public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the
public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874(4))
   (H) It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1) Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
      (2) Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use of
the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3) Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical, radio
or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874(5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).
(KRS 61.874(6))
§ 33A.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk/Treasurer does not have custody or control of the public
record or records requested, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall so notify the
applicant and shall furnish the name and location of the custodian of the
public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 33A.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed five (5) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 33A.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 33A.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   Each public agency, upon any request for records made under KRS 61.870
to 61.884, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five-day period of its decision. An agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian’s authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
(KRS 61.880(1))
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.
§ 33A.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.
   No official or employee of the city shall willfully conceal or destroy any
record with the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these rules
and regulations.

exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under

Ordinance Nos. 91-0301 and 92-0501 plus a standard rate of inflation, with a
minimum chargeable area of one acre per parcel.
      (3)   For properties located within the corporate limits of the City, the
reasonable cost of extending the sewer to the property line incurred by the
property owner will be credited toward the total cost per developable acre
using the formula contained within Ordinance Nos. 91-0301 and 92-0501.
Reasonable costs are those costs that are reviewed and approved by the City
Engineer.

reviewed under §
52.21 with costs to be determined based on the formula contained within
Ordinance Nos. 91-0301 and 92-0501, the anticipated volume usage proposed, and
benefits to the City.
   (C)   (1)   All monies paid to the City for connection to the sewer line

project bond issue for the properties being assessed for sewer service.

exceed the amount of the interest on the bond issue, the excess funds will be
deposited into the City sewer maintenance fund. At such time that the project
bond issue for the City is retired, all future tap-ins will be as described in

SMOKE DETECTORS
94.11 SMOKE DETECTORS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and
phrases shall have the following meanings unless the context clearly requires
otherwise:
   "DWELLING UNIT." Any group of room or rooms located within a building and
forming a single housekeeping unit with facilities which are used or designed
to be used for living, sleeping, cooking or eating.
   "DWELLING." Any building which contains one or more dwelling units or any
rooming unit, rooms or area designated or used for sleeping purposes either as
a primary use or use on casual occasions. Dwelling shall include a rooming
house, motels, tourist homes, school dormitories, apartment buildings and
condominiums but not to the exclusion of other dwelling units.
   "OWNER." Any person or legal entity who alone, jointly or severally with
others:
      (1)   Shall have all or part of the legal title to any dwelling or
dwelling unit, with or without accompanying actual possession thereof, or shall
have all or part of the beneficial ownership of any dwelling or dwelling unit
and a right to present use and enjoyment thereof, including a mortgage in
possession;
      (2)   Shall have charge, care of control of any dwelling or dwelling unit
as owner, or as executor, administrator, trustee, guardian of the estate, or
duly authorized agent of the owner. Any such person thus representing the
actual owner shall be bound to comply with the owner's obligations under this
section.
   "ROOMING UNIT." Any room which is designed or used for sleeping purposes. A
rooming unit may include a room in a rooming house, a hotel, a motel, a tourist
home, a school dormitory or an apartment building which may, or may not, have
some additional facilities for eating or cooking contained therein.
   "SLEEPING AREA." The area or areas of a dwelling unit in which the bedrooms
or sleeping rooms are located.
   (B)   Smoke Detectors Required.
      (1)   Subject to such exceptions and conditions for compliance as stated
herein, six months after the effective date of this section, smoke detectors
shall be required in all dwellings privately owned or rented for occupancy. It
shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new and/or existing occupied
dwelling unit to install smoke detectors in each dwelling unit as hereinafter
provided. Said smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing visible or invisible
particles of combustion and providing a suitable audible (or visual for the
deaf or hearing-impaired) alarm.
      (2)   This section shall apply to any and all dwellings or dwelling
units, new or existing, which do not fall under the jurisdiction of the
currently adopted Kentucky Building Code and/or the currently adopted Life
Safety Code (LSC 101).
   (C)   Type and Placement of Smoke Detectors.
      (1)   In order to comply with this section, only ionization or photo
electric type detectors approved by a nationally-recognized testing laboratory
shall be installed.
   Alternative: As an alternative to self-contained smoke detectors, under
certain limited conditions (i.e. battery powered smoke detectors), an approved
fire detection system or a combination thereof may be installed. The Bureau of
Fire Protection of the Wilder Volunteer Fire Department may subjectively, and
on a case-by-case basis, approve each and every alternative system in written
form.
      (2)   Smoke detectors in new residential dwellings must be wired directly
(hard wired) to the building's power supply with battery back up. In existing
buildings, it is preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power
supply; however, said detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery or
operated by an electrical plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer
device, provided that the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the
main power supply.
      (3)   Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with applicable
N.F.P.A. Standards. Detectors may be ceiling or wall mounted, provided that if
wall mounted they shall be within twelve (12) inches, but not closer than, six
(6) inches of the ceiling.
      (4)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area. Where bedrooms or rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are
separated by other used areas (such as kitchens or living rooms, but not
bathrooms or closets), they shall be considered as separate sleeping areas for
the purposes of this section. In a dwelling unit which contains a well-defined
sleeping room separated from the other activity areas of the same unit, the
detector shall be located in the corridor within the unit or interior area
giving direct access to the rooms used for sleeping purposes. Where sleeping
areas are separated and/or where a single smoke detector will not adequately
service all sleeping areas, there shall be a smoke detector installed adjacent
to each sleeping area.
      (5)   In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally located on the
ceiling.
      (6)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any rooming
unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each
dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally located
common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately service all sleeping
areas.
      (7)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed in or near each
stairway leading up to an occupied area in such a manner as to assure that
rising smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector and the detector
intercepts rising smoke before it reaches the occupied areas.
   (D)   Providing, Installing and Maintaining Smoke Detectors.
      (1)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for supplying and
installing in an operable condition the required
testing instructions to a tenant in the case of rental property.
      (2)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for maintenance and
testing of detectors, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, which are
located in common areas and/or detectors in rooming units where the tenant
usually has short periods of occupancy (hotels, motels, rooming or tourist
homes).
      (3)   The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and testing the
detector, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, which are within
his exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant shall be
responsible for notifying, in writing, the owner when a detector becomes
inoperable, whereafter the owner has ten (10) days in which to repair or
replace in operable condition said detector(s). In the battery operated type of
detector, battery replacement shall be the responsibility of the tenant.
      (4)   At every change of tenancy, it shall be the duty of the owner to
test and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition prior to re-renting the unit.
      (5)   At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by
or incidental to a sale, lease or sub-lease of said unit, it shall be the duty
of the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor or sub-lessor, as the case may
be,) to provide, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke detectors
as required by this section (or other applicable laws) are installed and in
proper working condition. Failure to comply with the subsection shall be
punishable as set forth herein; provided, however, that this subsection shall
not be construed to violate or render void any contract, lease or sub-lease
subject hereto.
      (6)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly connected
(permanently wired) to the electrical system of a structure without the proper
electrical certification.
   (E)   Supplemental Standards.
      (1)   This section is intended to be sued with, and supplemented by, the
applicable provisions of the National Fire Protection Standards Nos. 72-E and
74 (current edition) which are hereby incorporated herein; however, if there
shall be any conflict between this ordinance and the said supplemental
standards, this ordinance and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant
thereto shall prevail. All amendments to or changes in N.F.P.A. Nos. 72-E and
74 shall be adopted and made part thereof without further reference.
   (F)   Enforcement.
      (1)   The Bureau of Fire Prevention of the Wilder Fire Department shall
be primarily responsible for the enforcement of this section.
      (2)   The City Building Department shall assist the Bureau by making
referrals to the Bureau as part of its regular inspection and enforcement of
all city housing, building and safety codes. No building permits for remodeling
or repair of a dwelling unit shall be issued for any dwelling unit not properly
equipped with said detectors. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for
any new dwelling or dwelling unit not properly equipped with said detectors.
Detectors must be operable for the final inspection of the City Building
Inspector(s) and/or Fire Prevention Bureau Inspector. Instructions/maintenance
booklets must be provided to the owner by the manufacturer as per N.F.P.A. No.
74 and said documentation displayed to the Building Inspector(s) during the

(3) of this section, and the denominator which is two (2); and
         (b)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1)
tax district, by multiplying the net profits or gross receipts by the sales
factor as set forth in subsection (3) of this section.

allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
      (4)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the tax district, the
business entity may petition the tax district or the tax district may require,
in respect to all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if
reasonable:
         (a)   Separate accounting;

§ 155.01 PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the city 's authority concerning
the placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications
facilities, which authority is limited by state legislation. In order to ensure
that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications
facilities is consistent with the applicable law, the city is adopting a
single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities application and
permit process. The intent of this is, to the extent permitted by law, to
minimize the negative impact of wireless telecommunications facilities,
establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications,
assure an integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such
facilities and protect the health, safety and welfare of the city.

§ 155.04 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Every utility, or company that is engaged in the business of providing
the required infrastructure to a utility, that proposes to construct an antenna
tower for cellular telecommunications services or personal communications
services within the city shall submit a copy of the applicant's completed
uniform application to the Planning Commission to construct an antenna tower
for cellular or personal telecommunications services. The uniform application
shall:
      (1)   Include a grid map that shows the location of all existing cellular
antenna towers and that indicates the general position of proposed construction
sites for new cellular antenna towers within an area that includes all of the
Planning Commission’s jurisdiction; and a half (½) mile area outside of the
boundaries of the Planning Commission’s jurisdiction, if that area contains
either existing or proposed construction sites for cellular antenna towers;
      (2)   Include in any contract with an owner of property upon which a
cellular antenna tower is to be constructed a provision that specifies in the
case of abandonment a method that the utility will follow in dismantling and
removing a cellular antenna tower including a timetable for removal; and
      (3)   Comply with any local ordinances concerning land use subject to the
limitations imposed by 47 U.S.C. sec. 332(c), KRS 278.030, 278.040, and
278.280.
   (B)   Confidentiality of application information.
      (1)   All information contained in the application and any updates,
except for any map or other information that specifically identifies the
proposed location of the cellular antenna tower then being reviewed, shall be
deemed confidential and proprietary within the meaning of KRS 61.878.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall deny any public request for the
inspection of this information, whether submitted under Kentucky's Open Records
Act or otherwise, except when ordered to release the information by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
      (3)   Any person violating this subsection shall be guilty of official
misconduct in the second degree as provided under KRS 522.030.
   (C)   After an applicant's submission of the uniform application to
construct a cellular antenna tower, the Planning Commission shall:
      (1)   Review the uniform application in light of its agreement with the
comprehensive plan and locally adopted zoning regulations;
      (2)   Make its final decision to approve or disapprove the uniform
application; and
      (3)   Advise the applicant in writing of its final decision within sixty
(60) days commencing from the date that the uniform application is submitted to
the Planning Commission or within a date certain specified in a written
agreement between the local Planning Commission and the applicant.
      (4)   If the Planning Commission fails to issue a final decision within
sixty (60) days and if there is no written agreement between the local Planning
Commission and the applicant to a specific date for the Planning Commission to
issue a decision, the uniform application shall be deemed approved.
   (D)   If the Planning Commission disapproves of the proposed construction,
it shall state the reasons for disapproval in its written decision and may make
suggestions which, in its opinion, better accomplish the objectives of the
comprehensive plan and the locally adopted zoning regulations. No permit for
construction of a cellular or personal communications services antenna tower
shall be issued until the Planning Commission approves the uniform application
or the sixty (60) day time period has expired, whichever occurs first.
   (E)   The Planning Commission may require the applicant to make a reasonable
attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or related equipment. The Planning
Commission may provide the location of existing cellular antenna towers on
which the commission deems the applicant can successfully co-locate its
transmitting and related equipment. If the Planning Commission requires the
applicant to attempt co-location, the applicant shall provide the Planning
Commission with a statement indicating that the applicant has:
      (1)   Successfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to host
multiple wireless service providers' facilities or existing structures such as
a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of supporting
the applicant's facilities, and that identifies the location of the tower or
suitable structure on which the applicant will co-locate its transmission and
related facilities; or
      (2)   Unsuccessfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to host
multiple wireless service provider's facilities or existing structures such as
a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of supporting
the applicant's facilities and that:
         (a)   Identifies the location of the towers or other structures on
which the applicant attempted to co-locate; and
         (b)   Lists the reasons why the co-location was unsuccessful in each
instance.
   (F)   The Planning Commission may deny a uniform application to construct a
cellular antenna tower based on an applicant's unwillingness to attempt to co-
locate additional transmitting or related equipment on any new or existing
towers or other structures.
   (G)   In the event of co-location, a utility shall be considered the primary
user of the tower, if the utility is the owner of the antenna tower and if no
other agreement exists that prescribes an alternate arrangement between the
parties for use of the tower. Any other entity that co-locates transmission or
related facilities on a cellular antenna tower shall do so in a manner that
does not impose additional costs or operating restrictions on the primary user.
   (H)   Approval.
      (1)   Upon the approval of an application for the construction of a
cellular antenna tower by the Planning Commission, the applicant shall notify
the Public Service Commission within ten (10) working days of the approval.
      (2)   The notice to the Public Service Commission shall include a map
showing the location of the construction site.
      (3)   If an applicant fails to file notice of an approved uniform
application with the Public Service Commission, the applicant shall be
prohibited from beginning construction on the cellular antenna tower until such
notice has been made.
   (I)   A party aggrieved by a final action of the Planning Commission under
the provisions of KRS 100.985 to 100.987 may bring an action for review in any
court of competent jurisdiction.
