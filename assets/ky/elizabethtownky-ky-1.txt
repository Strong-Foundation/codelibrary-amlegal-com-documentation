upon the public’s confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed

a conflict between the private interests and public duties of a city or county
officer, employee, board or commission member, that confidence is imperiled;
and
   (C)   The city and county government has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers, employees, board or commission
members aware of the standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to
comply with while conducting their public duties.

be clearly established, uniform in their application and enforceable, and to
provide the officers, employees, board or commission members of the city and
county with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
KRS 65.003, as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city and county

architectural or cultural value have been significantly altered or destroyed
notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of preserving these buildings
or altering them in an appropriate way.
   (B)   The Council finds that the historic and architectural character of the
city is of vital importance in maintaining the economy of the city.
   (C)   The Council finds that the city has played an important role in the
development of the state and that the history of the city is shown today
through buildings representing the activities and events during its growth. The
Council finds that the city has buildings that represent the persons who live
or have lived in the city during a period of more than 100 years. It is the
finding of the City Council that the distinctive and significant character of
the city can only be maintained by protecting and enhancing its historic,
architectural and cultural heritage and by preventing unnecessary injury to its
historic district and its landmarks which are a civic and community asset.
   (D)   The Council finds that the Federal and Kentucky Governments have
passed laws to protect historic districts and landmarks and that the National
Historic Preservation Act, being 54 U.S.C. §§ 3000101 et seq., was amended in
1980 to establish a certified local government program creating a new federal-
state-local partnership to encourage the efforts by cities to protect and
preserve their historic districts and landmarks.
   (E)   The Council finds that the adoption of an ordinance to provide an
historic preservation program will benefit all the residents of the city and
all the owners of property.
   (F)   The City Council declares as a matter of public policy that the
preservation, protection and use of historic districts and landmarks are a
public benefit because they have a special character and historic,
architectural and cultural value and thus serve as visible reminders of the
history and heritage of the city, state and nation. The Council declares as a
matter of public policy that this subchapter is required in the interest of the
health, prosperity, safety, welfare and economic well-being of the people.
   (G)   The Council finds that the Main Street Program has contributed to the
revival of the central business district in the city, that it has increased the
awareness of the value of the older buildings in the city and that the historic
preservation program will strengthen the current revitalization work in the
city.

§ 34.068 CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   Certificate of appropriateness required.
      (1)   A certificate of appropriateness from the Commission shall be
required before a person may undertake the following actions affecting a
landmark or a property in a historic district:
         (a)   Alteration of the exterior part of a building or structure that
is visible to the public;
         (b)   New construction;
         (c)   Demolition; or
         (d)   Relocation.
      (2)   A certificate of appropriateness is required even when the proposed
work does not require a building permit. When seeking a building permit from
the city for a project involving designated property, a person must submit a
certificate of appropriateness approving any of the work listed in this
subchapter.
   (B)   Application to Commission. An applicant shall be referred to the
Commission when proposing an exterior alteration visible to the public, new
construction, demolition or relocation affecting a landmark or a property in a
historic district. The applicant shall supply the Commission with the
information required in order to render a decision on the application for a
certificate of appropriateness. The applicant shall provide, where applicable,
drawings of the proposed work, photographs of the existing building or site and
adjacent properties, and information about the building materials to be used.
When an applicant proposes to demolish a landmark or building or structure
within a historic district, if applicable, the applicant shall submit detailed
plans for the replacement building or structure and the time table for
completion of the new construction.
   (C)   Consultation with applicant. Before an applicant prepares plans, he or
she may bring a tentative proposal to the Commission for comments. The
Commission shall be aware of the importance of finding a way to meet the
current needs of the applicant. The Commission shall also recognize the
importance of approving plans that will be reasonable and economically feasible
for the applicant to implement.
   (D)   Guidelines for decision on applications. In rendering a decision on an
application, the Commission shall use its adopted guidelines. The Commission
shall consider the effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the property
in the historic district upon which work is to be performed, and the
relationship between such work and other adjacent or nearby buildings and
property. In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the Commission shall
consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style,
design, texture, materials and color. The certificate from the Commission shall
not relieve the applicant from complying with the requirements of other state
and local laws and regulations.
   (E)   Action by Commission; notice to applicants.
      (1)   The Commission shall hold a public meeting on each certificate of
appropriateness within 30 days after a completed application is received. The
Commission shall render a decision on the application within 45 days after the
receipt of a completed application provided that the Commission may extend the
time for decision an additional 60 days when the application is for demolition
or new construction. The Commission shall approve or disapprove each
application, and it shall give its reasons for its decision using the criteria
contained in this section and in its guidelines.
      (2)   Should the Commission, by majority vote, determine that the
application has a significant impact on the neighborhood and/or a historic
district, in lieu of approving or disapproving the application at the public
meeting, the Commission, by majority vote, may set a public hearing on the
certificate of appropriateness which shall be held within 45 days of the date
of the vote. The Commission may suggest modifications to an application and may
then approve a certificate of appropriateness providing for revisions in the
plans submitted. If the Commission fails to decide on an application within the
specified time period, the application shall be deemed approved.
      (3)   Applicants, and all owners of property that adjoin the property for
which the certificate of appropriateness is sought, shall be given notice of
the public meetings and hearings relating to their application and shall be
informed of the Commission’s decision. Advertised notice of the public hearing
shall be given, including conspicuous posting on the property for 14
consecutive days immediately prior to the hearing. Notice of a public hearing
shall also be given in a local news publication serving the city. The
Commission may include in its application fee a charge for the cost of giving
notice of the public hearing.
      (4)   Upon approval of the application, the applicant will receive a
certificate of appropriateness.
   (F)   Length of validity of certificate of appropriateness. A certificate of
appropriateness shall remain valid for one year after it is issued. Work is
required to start before the end of the one-year period. If the approved work
has not been completed within two years after the certificate of
appropriateness was issued, the Commission shall review the situation and may
require an application for a certificate of appropriateness for the work that
remains to be done.
   (G)   Stop work order; injunction. In the event work is being performed
without the required certificate of appropriateness, the city shall issue a
stop work order. All work shall cease on the designated property. No additional
work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in
effect. The Commission shall meet with the owner or tenant to resolve the
problem. The City Attorney may seek in Circuit Court an injunction and any
other appropriate relief in order that the intent of this subchapter be carried
out. The procedures authorized in this section may be used in the event work is
being performed not in accordance with the certificate of appropriateness
issued by the Commission.
   (H)   Demolition of landmark, building or structure in historic district.
When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark or a building or structure in a
historic district, the Commission may negotiate with the applicant to determine
if there is a viable alternative to demolition. The Commission may ask
interested individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an
alternative to demolition and in obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs
for the threatened building. After its public meeting, the Commission may
determine that a building or structure in a historic district may be demolished
if it does not contribute to the historic district. On all other demolition
applications, the Commission shall study the question of economic hardship on
the applicant and shall determine whether the landmark or the property in a
historic district has a reasonable and beneficial use without the approval of
the demolition application. In the case of an income-producing building, the
Commission shall also determine whether the applicant can obtain a reasonable
return from his or her building. The Commission may ask applicants for
additional information to be used in making these determinations. If economic
hardship or obtaining a reasonable return is not proven, the Commission shall
deny the demolition application unless the Commission finds grounds to grant
the demolition application under the points contained in this subchapter. When
the Commission approves demolition of a building or structure, that approval
shall be valid for one year from the date of final action taken by the
Commission. If demolition has not commenced and completed within one year, the
Commission shall review the circumstances and shall require a new application
to authorize the demolition, or to authorize any work remaining.
   (I)   Moving a landmark, building or structure in historic district. When an
applicant wishes to move a landmark, building or structure in a historic
district, or when an applicant wishes to move a building or structure to a lot
containing a landmark, or to a property in a historic district, the Commission
shall consider the contribution the building or structure makes to its present
setting; whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated; whether
the building or structure can be moved without significant damage to its
physical integrity; and the compatibility of the building or structure to its
proposed site and adjacent properties. These considerations shall be in
addition to the points contained in this subchapter.
   (J)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   When a property is damaged by fire, a storm or other unexpected
event, the owner or tenant may receive approval from the Chairperson or Vice-
Chairperson of the Commission for work to be done in response to this
emergency. At its next meeting, the Commission shall be informed of the
certificate of appropriateness that was issued. In situations requiring
temporary action, an owner may do work in order to protect temporarily his or
her property from further damage provided he or she reports this work to the
Commission within two business days.
      (2)   In any case where the city determines that there are emergency
conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting a landmark or a
property in a historic district, the city may order the remedying of these
conditions without the approval of the Commission. When it is possible, the
city shall consult with the Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson of the Commission
about the action being taken. If consultation is not possible, the city shall
notify the Commission of the action taken after the completion of the work.
   (K)   Routine alterations; ordinary maintenance.
      (1)   The Commission shall prepare a list of routine alterations that
shall receive immediate approval from the Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson of
the Commission without a public meeting, when an applicant complies with the
specifications of the Commission. The list shall include paint colors
appropriate for different types of buildings. At each meeting, the Commission
shall be informed of the certificates of appropriateness that have been issued
under this provision.
      (2)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a landmark or a property
in a historic district does not change its exterior appearance that is visible
to the public. Every person in charge of a landmark or a property in a historic
district shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of such
buildings or structures; and all interior portions thereof which, if not so
maintained, may cause such buildings or structures to deteriorate or to become
damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair. The purpose of this
provision is to prevent a person from forcing the demolition of his or her
building by neglecting it and by permitting damage to the building because of
weather or vandalism. No provision in this subchapter shall be interpreted to
require an owner or tenant to undertake an alteration or to restore his or her
building to its original appearance. The provisions of this section shall be in
addition to the provisions of the state’s Building Code requiring buildings and
structures to be kept in good repair.

graded by the Commission, testing company or agent employed by the Commission.
   (B)   Probationary period.
      (1)   As part of the qualification procedure, after certification as a
police officer, applicants will be placed on a probationary status for a period
of one year. Applicants will be placed on a probationary status for a period of
one year from their dates of graduation from the police academy. See KRS 95.762
(5). The purpose of the period of probation is to provide the Chief of Police
and Mayor reasonable opportunity to evaluate the appointee as to his or her
ability to perform assigned duties, to learn proper police procedures, to
accept and respond to supervision and to conduct themselves properly as a
police officer. The probationary period shall be regarded as an intrinsic part
of the process and shall be utilized for closely observing the employee’s work
for securing the most effective adjustment of a new employee to his or her
position, and the elimination of any probationary employee whose performance
does not meet the required standard of work.
      (2)   During the probation period, any employee may be dismissed by the
city without the right of the employee to a review of any kind unless the
employee has a reason to believe that the dismissal was made for political or
religious reasons or because of discrimination with respect to race, color,
sex, national origin or other protected class, in which case he or she shall
have the right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission. Notice of dismissal
within the probationary period shall be given to the employee in writing, and
no statement of reason to the employee is mandatory on the part of the city.
   (C)   Results of examination and application for entry level positions.
      (1)   The names of persons who have passed all portions of the
examination process, and who meet all other qualifications, shall be certified
and ranked in the order of their ratings earned in the examinations given for
the purpose of establishing the list. The ratings earned in the examination
process shall be divided into bands. Bands are a series of test scores, defined
by a high score and a low score, which may be indicative of a certain level of
knowledge, skill or ability. All scores falling within a given band shall be
considered tied scores of the same rank and shall be certified at the same
time. Everyone within a certain range of scores or band gets the same grade.
There will be three bands. The separation is determined by the following
scoring:
         (a)   Band A includes all scores from 90 to 100;
         (b)   Band B includes all scores from 80 to 89; and
         (c)   Band C includes all scores from 70 to 79.
      (2)   Scoring for each applicant shall be as follows:
         (a)   Oral interview: 50 points; and
         (b)   Written examination: 50 points.
   (D)   Lateral transfers.
      (1)   (a)   Any applicant who is a Kentucky POPS Certified Officer (KRS
15.380, KRS 15.402 and KRS 95A.230) and who meets KLEC standards shall not be
required to take the written examination. Said applicant shall be eligible for
priority ranking on the list and placement in Band A.
         (b)   Any applicant who is a certified officer outside of the
commonwealth may be exempted from taking the written examination at the
discretion of the Chief of the Police Department. Said applicant may be
eligible to receive priority ranking and placement in Band A at the discretion
of the Chief of the Police Department.
      (2)   The certification process shall be done by the Commission and
presented to the Mayor of the city, who shall select one individual from three
candidates certified for appointment. All candidates in a band have the same
score and are ranked and certified together. If two vacancies exist, then four
candidates are eligible for appointment. If three vacancies exist, then five
are eligible and so forth. The list thus certified to the Mayor shall always
contain at least two more eligible names than the number of vacancies to be
filled. If there are not enough candidates in the top band, then the Commission
shall also certify all of the candidates in the next band of tied scores.
      (3)   The results of said examination (written and oral) shall be open to
inspection by the applicant for 30 days following the examination.
      (4)   Five points will be added to the passing score of the written
examination for any honorably discharged member of the United States Armed
Forces (KRS 90.320(3)).
      (5)   Applicants who have successfully passed all portions of the
examination process and have met other requirements, may be retained on the
list of eligible appointees for a period of one year for any similar vacancy
and the Mayor may hire or select from this list or the Mayor may select from a
new list from a new examination whenever the number of eligible appointees on
the one year list shall be less than the number of vacancies to be filled, plus
two; however, no person shall be certified by the Commission from any eligible
list more than four times to the Mayor for the same or similar position.
   (E)   Procedures for promotion.
      (1)   Eligibility and announcement (Sergeant and Lieutenant).
         (a)   Personnel eligible for promotion to the next highest rank are
those holding the next lowest rank and successfully completed their
probationary period. Officers must have at least two years of law enforcement
experience.
            1.   Sergeant: probationary period plus two years of experience.
Total of three years.
            2.   Lieutenant: probationary period plus one year of experience as
Sergeant. Total of two years.
         (b)   A written announcement will be provided to all eligible
employees identifying the position to be filled and instructions to apply
(resumes required). The announcement will include a job description and closing
date for application. Once the application period has closed, additional
instructions will be provided to all candidates.
         (c)   All applicants will be required to sign a non-disclosure
agreement regarding the questions and/or assessments while the process is
active. The process will remain active until the final interviews (Chief's
interview) are completed.
         (d)   The position of Chief of Police (Colonel) and Deputy Chief
(Major) are non-civil service positions and are not included within the Civil
Service Ordinance.
      (2)   Procedures (Sergeant).
         (a)   All applicants will be required to submit a resume to the Deputy
Chief of Administration.
         (b)   The first step in the process will be a written examination. The
test will be developed and administered by an outside representative. The
written examination consists of 40% of the candidate's overall score.
         (c)   The second step of the promotional process will be an assessment
of the candidate's ability to navigate situational questions. The assessment
portion of the process will consist of two task-oriented questions requiring
the candidate to navigate supervisory related tasks. Each task will be worth 25
% of the candidate's overall score, 50% total. An assessment center panel shall
be established to conduct oral interviews and assessment of the candidates
based on the task-oriented and situational questions. Assessment center panels
will consist of one command level officer within the Police Department and two
from outside law enforcement organizations. Outside raters for the assessment
center must be certified law enforcement professionals of accredited law
enforcement organizations outside of Hardin County and contiguous counties.
Members must serve within the rank of Sergeant or higher.
         (d)   The third and last step in this process is the accumulation of
suitability points. This section consists of 10% of the candidate's overall
score. Although this is listed as the third step, this step may take place at
any point within the promotional process. The suitability list is identical to
the list as defined in division (F) below. Please see division (F) below for a
detailed explanation.
         (e)   Once the testing process has completed, a numerical promotional
list will be communicated to the candidates. The Chief of Police and both
Deputy Chiefs (Command Staff) will conduct a final interview with the top three
candidates. If more than one position is vacant, one additional candidate will
be interviewed. Example: two vacancies would equal the top four candidates,
three vacancies would equal the top five candidates, and the like. Once the
final interview begins, all candidates included within the final interview are
equally positioned within the promotional process. The Chief of Police, in
consultation with the Deputy Chiefs, will make their final recommendation to
the Mayor.
         (f)   Once the promotions are finalized, the Chief of Police may elect
to maintain the established list for one year or may elect to start a new
promotional process for future opportunities. If the Chief of Police elects to
maintain the current promotional list, the list will be effective for one year.
The year will start after the promotional list is published.
      (3)   Procedures (Lieutenant).
         (a)   All applicants will be required to submit a resume to the Deputy
Chief of Administration.
         (b)   The first step of the promotional process will be an assessment
of the candidate's ability to navigate situational questions. The assessment
portion of the process will consist of two task-oriented questions requiring
the candidate to navigate mid-level supervisory related tasks and a third
section consisting of approximately six interview style questions. Each task or
section will be worth 30% of the candidate's overall score, 90% total. An
assessment center panel shall be established to conduct oral interviews and
assessment of the candidates based on task-oriented and situational questions.
Assessment center panels will consist of one command level officer within the
Police Department and two from outside law enforcement organizations. Outside
members for the assessment center must be certified law enforcement
professionals of accredited law enforcement organizations outside of Hardin
County and contiguous counties. Members must serve within the rank of
lieutenant or higher.
         (c)   The last step in this process is the accumulation of suitability
points. This section consists of 10% of the candidate's overall score. Although
this is listed as the last step, this step may take place at any point within
the promotional process. The suitability list is identical to the list for
sergeant. Please see division (F) below for a detailed explanation.
         (d)   Once the promotions process has completed, a numerical
promotional list will be published for all candidates. The Chief of Police and
both Deputy Chiefs (Command Staff) will conduct a final interview with the top
three candidates. If more than one position is vacant, one additional candidate
will be interviewed. Example: two vacancies would equal the top four
candidates, three vacancies would equal the top five candidates, and the like.
Once the final interview begins, all candidates included within the final
interview are equally positioned within the promotional process. The Chief of
Police, in consultation with the Deputy Chiefs, will make their final
recommendation to the Mayor.
         (e)   Once the promotions are finalized, the Chief of Police may elect
to maintain the established list for one year or may elect to start a new
promotional process for future opportunities. If the Chief of Police elects to
maintain the current promotional list, the list will be effective for one year.
The year will start once the promotional list is published.
   (F)   Suitability rating. The suitability portion of the promotional process
is designed to reward those candidates who possess qualities favorable to
supervisory personnel. Below is a list of attributes and detractions considered
during the suitability computation. Candidates may only attain ten points or
10%.
      (1)   Additive points.
         (a)   Good conduct in grade: one point; and
         (b)   Pass PT Test: one point (within last six months of promotional
process).
      (2)   Active duty time.
         (a)   Less than four years: one point; and
         (b)   Four years or more: two points.
      (3)   Higher education.

         (b)   Bachelor’s degree: three points; and
         (c)   Master’s degree: four points.

Southern Police Institute Administrative Officers Course shall add one point to
the above scoring.
      (5)   Years of service with the Police Department.
         (a)   Five to nine years of service: one point;
         (b)   Ten to 14 years of service: two points; and
         (c)   Fifteen years or more: three points.
      (6)   Other agencies. Years of service with other agencies may apply
after applicant has completed one year of probation.
      (7)   Deductive points. Deductions (based upon the previous year of
promotional examination):
         (a)   Detractions occurring within the previous 12 months (date of
promotional posting).
            1.   Each job performance/counseling statement: deduct one point.
            2.   Each at-fault motor vehicle collision: deduct one point.
         (b)   Suspension without pay or reduction in grade within the last 12
months (date of promotional posting).
            1.   One to 40 hours: disqualification.
            2.   Greater than 40 hours: disqualification.
            3.   Demotion: disqualification.

            3.   Demotion: deduct ten points.
   (G)   Computation of scores on promotional tests.
      (1)   To compute any applicant’s score, the Civil Service Commission
shall utilize the following calculations.

            2.   Fifty percent assessment center (25% each task).
            3.   Ten percent suitability.
         (b)   Lieutenant list.
            1.   Ninety percent assessment center (30% each task).
            2.   Ten percent suitability.
      (2)   The Commission shall certify a list of candidates and their total
scores with rankings of highest to lowest on total test scores. In accordance
with KRS 90.350(1), the Mayor may select one of the top three (or two of the
top four and the like) to fill the position.
      (3)   The Commission shall notify each candidate of his or her percentage
score on the promotional examination and how said score ranks in comparison
with the other candidates.
   (H)   Promotion probationary period.
      (1)   Any promoted officer is on probation for one year from the date of
appointment and may be reduced with or without cause within that probationary
time.
      (2)   As a safeguard against the promotion of employees beyond their
capability, the Department includes a probationary period as the final step in
the promotion process. Upon appointment to probational vacancies, officers are
on probationary status for one year from the date of promotion. After the
conclusion of the probationary period, if demoted, the officer shall be given a
written list of reasons and said demotion shall be reviewed by the Civil
Service Commission if requested by the employee.

90.320(3)).
      (3)   If an applicant passes the written examination and is a Kentucky

      (4)   The names of persons who have passed all portions of the
examination process and who meet all other qualifications shall be certified

the purpose of establishing a list. The scores earned in the examination
process shall be divided into bands. The band is defined by a high score and a
low score, which may be indicative of the shared level of knowledge, skill or
ability of the applicants. All scores falling within a given band shall be
considered tied and shall be certified at the same time. There can be up to
three bands with the designations A, B and C.
      (5)   The certification process shall be done by the Commission and
presented to the Mayor of the city, who shall select one individual from three
candidates certified for appointment. If two vacancies exist, then four
candidates are eligible for appointment. If three vacancies exist, then five
are eligible and so forth. The list thus certified to the Mayor shall always
contain at least two more eligible names than the number of vacancies to be
filled. If there are not enough candidates in the top band, then the Commission
shall also certify all of the candidates in the next band of tied scores.
      (6)   The results of said examination (written and oral or assessment)

      (8)   Applicants who have successfully passed all portions of the
examination process and have met other requirements, may be retained on the
list of eligible appointees for a period of one year for any similar vacancy
and the Mayor may hire or select from this list or the Mayor may select from a
new list from a new examination whenever the number of eligible appointees on
the one year list shall be less than the number of vacancies to be filled, plus
two; however, no person shall be certified by the Commission from any eligible
list more than four times to the Mayor for the same or similar position.
   (C)   Procedures for promotion within the Fire Department.
      (1)   Those persons eligible for promotion to the next highest rank are

level position) within the Fire Department to the next highest rank requires
that the employee serve past a probationary period of one year and have
experience either within the city’s Fire Department or in a Chapter 95 Fire
Department equaling years of service in the lowest rank.
      (3)   For all subsequent promotion eligibility, the employee is required
to serve in their current rank for at least one year past his or her
probationary period of one year (total of two years in time and grade).

to take said test.
      (6)   In addition to a written examination, all applicants shall be

emergency services or other fire agencies acceptable to the Civil Service
Commission. A representative of the city’s Civil Service Commission shall be in
attendance during such oral reviews. The oral review by said panel shall relate
to the candidates’ general experience, judgment and fitness for the proposed
promotion. The Chief or his or her designee will be present during the oral
review, but they shall not participate in or score same in any manner
whatsoever. An assessment center may be substituted for the oral review,
provided it meets the approval of the Civil Service Commission.

Service Commission prior to knowing the results of either the written
examination or the oral review of the applicants for promotion.
   (D)   Computation of scores on promotional tests.
      (1)   To compute any applicant’s score, the Civil Service Commission
shall take the sum of the percentage of correct answers, based on 100 points
possible, on the written examination by 45% to provide a possible 45 points
(i.e., an applicant who scores 100% correct on a written examination shall
receive 45 points), plus the percentage of average cumulative score as
determined by the panel on the oral examination or assessment center to equal
40 points, plus the suitability rating up to a maximum of 15 points, equaling a
total of 100 points.
      (2)   The Commission shall certify a list of candidates and their total
scores with rankings of highest to lowest based on total test scores. In
accordance with KRS 90.350(1), the Mayor will approve one of the top three (or
two of the top four and the like) to fill the position. The Commission shall
notify each candidate of his or her score on the promotional examination and
how said score ranks in comparison with the other candidates.
      (3)   As a safeguard against the promotion of employees beyond their
capability, the Department includes a probationary period as the final step in
the promotion process. Upon appointment to probation vacancies, officers are on
probationary status for one year from the date of promotion. If demoted, the
officer shall be given a written list of reasons and said demotion shall be
reviewed by the Civil Service Commission if requested by the employee.

   (A)   The City Council finds that:
      (1)   Whereas numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major
contributor to indoor air pollution. Breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of
disease in healthy nonsmokers. These diseases include heart disease, stroke,
respiratory disease and lung cancer;
      (2)   Whereas, the U.S. Surgeon General has issued a comprehensive
scientific report which concludes that there is no risk-free level of exposure
to secondhand smoke (Department of Health and Human Services, New Surgeon
General's Report Focuses on the Effects of Secondhand Smoke; Public Health
Service, Centers for Disease Control, 2006); and
      (3)   Whereas the smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a danger
to health and a material public nuisance.
   (B)   Accordingly, the City Council adopts the foregoing as justification
for this subchapter, the purpose of which is:
      (1)   To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in
public places and places of employment;
      (2)   To guarantee the right of non-smokers to breathe smoke-free air;
and
      (3)   To recognize that the public's need to breathe smoke-free air shall
have priority over the individual's desire to smoke.

employee of an establishment regulated by this subchapter observes a person or
persons violating this subchapter, he or she shall immediately direct the
person or persons in violation to extinguish the item being smoked.
      (1)   In the event the person or persons violating this subchapter
complies with this directive, no violation shall exist for the owner, manager,
operator or employee witnessing the violation. In the event an owner, manager,
operator or employee of an establishment regulated by this subchapter observes

those premises, in this event the owner, manager, operator or employee may
reasonably determine to allow the person violating this subchapter to remain on
the premises until appropriate arrangements may be made for the person's
removal.
         (b)   In the event the person or persons violating this subchapter is
timely removed from the premises, no violation shall exist for any owner,
manager, operator or employee related to the establishment in which these
events occurred. In no event is an owner or agent of the premises to forcibly
remove the person violating this subchapter. Compliance is achieved under this
division (E) if the owner or agent of the premises orders the person violating
this subchapter to leave its premises and promptly notifies the police if the
person refuses.
      (3)   In the event the person or persons violating this subchapter fails
or refuses to comply with this directive and the owner, manager, operator or
employee who observed the violation or if a different person who directed the
person or persons in violation to leave the premises, fails to take immediate
and reasonable steps to obtain the removal of the person or persons from the
premises, the owner, manager, operator or employee failing to take appropriate
steps required by this subchapter shall be in violations of this subchapter.
      (4)   In all events, the establishment in which a violation occurs shall
be in violation of this subchapter for each violation that occurs on its
premises and in connection with which the owner, manager, operator or employee
fail to take appropriate steps required by this subchapter.
      (5)   An employee who observes a person [or persons] violating this
subchapter may immediately notify his or her owner, manager or supervisor of
the violation in satisfaction of the employee's responsibility under this
subchapter. The failure of the satisfaction of the employee's responsibility
under this subchapter. The failure of the employee's owner, manager or
supervisor to take appropriate steps required by this subchapter in response to
the employee's notice shall not constitute a violation on the part of the
employee.
      (6)   In the event all duties required under this section are satisfied
yet the person violating this subchapter persists in his or her violation and/
or refuses to vacate the premises on which the violation occurred, the owner,
manager, supervisor and/or employee shall immediately contact one or more of
the agencies or departments authorized above to enforce this subchapter
informing the agency or department of the circumstances of the violation.
      (7)   The mere presence of a person smoking within premises of an
establishment governed by this subchapter does not constitute a violation on
the part of the establishment. The establishment and its agents shall only be
charged for a violation of this subchapter if the responsible agent(s) of the
establishment fail to timely satisfy each responsibility prescribed for them in
this section.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the city, the
county’s Health Department, an employee or any person aggrieved by a failure to
comply with this subchapter, whether by commission or omission, including
violations on the part of an owner, operator, manager, employee or other person
(s) in control of a public place or a place of employment covered by this
subchapter may bring legal action to enforce this subchapter, either by civil
action seeking injunctive relief or by criminal complaint in a court of
competent jurisdiction.

sign must be approved by the city.

erecting any traffic barrier or sign whose placing has been approved by the

(Ord. 06-2012, passed 4-2-2012)
§ 91.054 GENERAL PERMIT STANDARDS.
   All construction shall be protected from flooding and erosion damage (i.e.,
open pipes shall be protected from filling with mud or debris). Erosion and
flooding control shall be exercised during construction to prevent damage to
property adjacent to the development. An erosion prevention and sediment
control permit, per Ord. 01-2007, shall be obtained prior to work being
started.
   (A)   Drainage. Any proposal to alter or increase a drainage area or change
in any way a drainage structure must be accompanied by a complete drainage
survey (upstream and downstream) based on a 25-year and a 100-year storm with
hydraulic analysis of all affected drainage structures in the area. In the
event that any permittee’s development is to create sufficient additional
surface drainage runoff, so that the existing downstream drainage facilities
such as ditches, paved ditches, special channels or any other drainage facility
within city-maintained right-of-way becomes inadequate to accommodate the
increased flow, it is then the sole responsibility of the permittee to:
      (1)   Modify or replace the downstream drainage facility or facilities,
in order that the increased flow is adequately accommodated to the satisfaction
of the city; and
      (2)   Provide an on-site detention basin of appropriate capacity and
discharge design to enable the existing downstream drainage facilities to
continue to function adequately to the satisfaction of the city, as required by
this subchapter, the Zoning Ordinance, the Subdivision Regulations and Property
Maintenance Ordinance.
   (B)   Utilities.
      (1)   Utilities are not to be placed in or through existing drainage
conduits.
      (2)   Notification of utility companies before excavating (Occupational
Safety and Health Act requirements) - Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health
Standards for the construction industry which has the effect of law states in
part (1926.651 Specific Excavation Requirements): “Prior to opening an
excavation, effort shall be made to determine whether underground installation,
i.e., sewer, telephone, water, fuel, electrical lines or other utilities will
be encountered and, if so, where such underground installations are located.
When the excavation approaches the estimated location of such an installation,
the exact location shall be determined and when it is uncovered, proper
supports shall be provided for the existing installation. Utility companies
shall be contacted and advised of proposed work prior to the start of actual
excavation.” Known location of underground utilities shall be shown on
applicant’s plan. The applicant must contact the Kentucky Underground
Protection (811) to help locate underground utilities.
   (C)   Restoration. In areas where turf is present, restoration will consist
of dressing and reseeding all affected areas of the right-of-way. In all cases,
a good turf is to be guaranteed by the permittee.
   (D)   Maintenance. Permittees are responsible for the maintenance of all
encroachments and entrances. Pipelines or other utility crossings beneath the
pavement shall have sufficient connections so that repairs may be made without
disturbing the roadway surface. Manholes and other points of access to
underground utilities may be permitted within the right-of-way, if located so
as to not interfere with maintenance of the roadway facility or present safety
hazards to the road users.
   (E)   Grading. If grading is required on an established right-of-way, the
permittee shall provide a grading plan for review.
(Ord. 06-2012, passed 4-2-2012)
§ 91.055 ENTRANCE CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Entrance width, as measured at the property line, shall be as follows:
      (1)   Residential, single-family: no minimum, 30 feet maximum;
      (2)   Residential, multi-family: 20 feet minimum, 30 feet maximum;
      (3)   Commercial: 20 feet minimum, 50 feet maximum; and
      (4)   Industrial: 24 feet minimum, 60 feet maximum.
   (B)   Necessary drainage structures for an entrance shall not be connected
to an existing drainage structure unless the necessary junction boxes, manholes
and catch basins are installed, as approved by the Engineering Department and
the Storm Water Department.
   (C)   Entrance pipe shall extend at least 24 inches beyond the edge of the
entrance. Entrance pipe size shall meet the approval of the City Engineer and
the Director of Storm Water Management in accordance with §
91.054(A) of this chapter, but in no case shall the diameter be less than 12
inches.
   (D)   All entrance pipe shall be concrete, bituminous coated corrugated
metal or HDPE and shall meet the approval of the City Engineer and the Director
of Storm Water Management.
   (E)   Valley gutters constructed of concrete or bituminous material may be
used in lieu of entrance pipe where such pipe cannot be placed. Prior approval
of the City Engineer and the Director of Storm Water Management for use of such
gutters is required.
   (F)   Where long lengths of pipe are used, catch basins or clean-out boxes
shall be installed at approximate intervals of 50 feet based on pipe diameter
of 12 inches. Special consideration may be given to placement of clean-out
boxes at longer intervals for pipe with larger diameters. Clean-out boxes shall
also be constructed at all angles in pipe alignment.
   (G)   When necessary, gratings and catch basins must be employed to
intercept and prevent water flowing from the driveway over the sidewalks or
roadway.
   (H)   The maximum grade for an entrance to a multi-family, commercial or
industrial use shall be no greater than 10%. When an entrance grade at its
intersection with the public street exceeds 3%, a leveling area shall be
provided with grades no greater than 3% for a distance of 50 feet from the
intersection with the street.
   (I)   When curbs are used along the roadway and sidewalks are used or
contemplated, the gradient of the driveway shall fit the plane of the sidewalk
and shall meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, being
42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. If the difference in elevation of the gutter and the
sidewalk is such that this is not practical, the sidewalk shall be lowered to
provide a suitable gradient for the driveway and the surface of the sidewalk
shall be sloped gently away from either side of the driveway. The flow line of
the curb shall not be filled with any material. The curb can be modified only
with permission from the City Engineer. All new or modified curb entrances
shall meet the current standards of the city.
(Ord. 06-2012, passed 4-2-2012)
§ 91.056 ENCROACHMENT PERMIT CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Underground utilities.
      (1)   Underground utilities installed longitudinally within the right-of-
way limits of streets shall be buried to a minimum depth of 30 inches.
Exceptions may be made only where the terrain is such that this requirement
would prove impractical and where location of pipelines on the surface would
not interfere with roadway maintenance, safety or aesthetics.
      (2)   Underground utilities shall be constructed of materials which may
be expected to render long trouble-free life and in some cases, may be required
to be encased to allow removal and replacement without the necessity of cutting
the pavement.
   (B)   Existing longitudinal facilities. Existing longitudinal storm sewers,
sanitary sewers, telephone conduits, power conduits, water lines, oil lines,
gas lines or other type utility lines may be permitted to remain under pavement
and shoulder areas, when the facilities will be maintenance free insofar as the
necessity for cutting or disturbing the pavement and shoulder areas.
Distribution and service lines constructed of maintenance-free materials and in
good condition may remain under a proposed pavement provided full provision is
made for all future service requirements by stubbing out service lines on
either side of the new construction prior to placing the proposed pavement.
   (C)   New facilities.
      (1)   Generally, new facilities are not to be installed longitudinally
under proposed pavement and shoulder areas. Only when there is no other
practical location available may any new facility be placed under the pavement
or shoulder area. In the event such an installation is allowed, it must be
constructed of long life materials which are expected to be maintenance free
with all possible provisions made to minimize the likelihood of having to cut
the pavement or interfere with traffic in the future.
      (2)   Boring of entrances adjacent to the main line roadway which are
paved with concrete or bituminous surface may be required. The preferred
methods to be employed in underground installations are augering, jacking,
boring, pushing and tunneling.
      (3)   New or relocated utilities installed longitudinally shall be
located where feasible back of the ditch line and top of slope and as close to
the right-of-way as practical. Where curb and gutters are provided, underground
utilities should be located back of the curb when possible.
   (D)   Overhead utilities installed longitudinally.
      (1)   Utility poles or towers having crossarms. Utility poles or towers
having crossarms are to be located not more than five feet inside the right-of-
way line, except for offsets in the right-of-way line due to high fills, deep
cuts or other obstructions.
      (2)   Utility poles or towers having no crossarms. Utility poles or
towers having no crossarms are to be located not more than 18 inches inside the
right-of-way line, except for offsets in the right-of-way line due to high
fills, deep cuts or other obstructions.
      (3)   Overhead utility crossings. The vertical clearance of an overhead
utility crossing of a city street shall be a minimum of 18 feet, but in no case
shall the clearance be less than the requirements of the National Electrical
Safety Code. Minimum allowable clearances are as follows:
 
0 - 750 volts         18 feet
750 - 15,000 volts    20 feet
15,000 - 50,000 volts 22 feet
 
(Ord. 06-2012, passed 4-2-2012)
§ 91.057 SPECIAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Turn storage lanes. When congestion is or may be created on the
traveled way by vehicles desiring to turn left into a development or
subdivision, the creation of a left turn storage lane may be required. Left
turn lanes shall be constructed as outlined in the Kentucky Transportation
Cabinet’s Auxiliary Turn Lane Policy, dated July 2009. The storage lane shall
be constructed without expense to the city. The applicant shall pay for a
traffic study if required by the city.
   (B)   Tapers and increased radii. At some locations, entrance capacity
deficiencies may result from restrictions in the alignment, profile or cross-
section of the entrance rather than from interior circulation and parking
problems or larger than anticipated entering traffic volumes. In these
instances, improved capacity may be required by the provision of longer
entrance radii or by the addition of a taper connecting the entrance radius and
the edge of the traveled way.
   (C)   Limited access streets.
      (1)   The use of limited access streets on private property can be
required where deemed applicable by the City Engineer, in order to minimize the
number of access points to the roadway from commercial and residential
developments. These limited access streets are to be indicated on the
applicant’s plans and, when applicable, indicated on the record plats for the
development.
      (2)   Limited access streets shall be constructed to meet city standards
based on the functional street classification.
      (3)   In the layout of limited access streets, the design of the
intersection of these roads with other streets is to receive particular
consideration, since special traffic problems occur if small turning radii are
created at these intersections. In order to minimize these turning movements
and traffic interference problems, radii of sufficient length are to be
approved by the city to accommodate right-turn movement from the street into
the limited access street, or vice versa, as measured along the inside edge of
the street and limited access street pavement.
   (D)   Divided highways.
      (1)   Median cuts. Median cuts shall be limited to 600 feet or more. The
need for median cuts shall be considered upon receipt of an application for an
entrance permit. Before authorizing new median cuts, consideration shall be
given to aligning access points with existing median cuts through the use of
redesigned parking facilities within the development or the construction of
limited access streets.
      (2)   Residential entrances. Residential access shall be limited to one
side of the divided highway unless aligned with an existing or proposed median
cut. Such access shall be located so as to conform to appropriate spacing for
the roadway, but entrances should not be any closer than two feet from a
property line unless the entrance serves as a joint access between adjoining
properties.
      (3)   Commercial and industrial entrances.
         (a)   Commercial and industrial entrances shall align with an existing
or proposed median cut unless the entrance is deemed minor in nature whereas
access may be permitted to one side of the divided highway.
         (b)   Such access shall be located so as to conform to appropriate
spacing for the roadway, but entrances should not be any closer than two feet
from a property line unless the entrance serves as a joint access between
adjoining properties.
      (4)   Field entrances. Field entrances for use by farm equipment may be
permitted by the city, but shall be limited in access to one side of the
highway unless aligned with an existing or proposed median cut. Field entrances
shall be considered temporary in nature and may be allowed at locations not
conforming to spacing standards.
   (E)   Sight distance restrictions. A driveway, entrance or new road
connection shall not be allowed at locations which will prevent a vehicle
approaching at legal control speed from having a six- second visibility time to
the stopping position of the driveway, entrance or new road both directions of
travel based on standards established by AASHTO.

      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax

division (C) below; and
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (A) through (D) below, the business
entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the Occupational Tax
Office.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period:
      (1)   The sales, lease or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than

         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States Government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenue from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity; and
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profits.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered with the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of the taxpayer’s reported percentage under this section,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.

quarter, make a return to the city and pay to the city, the tax required to be
withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or required to
report within a reasonable time after some other period as determined by the
city.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any sums
required by this ordinance to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to be
withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational

copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax statements, or

withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor the cessation of holding
any corporate office, shall discharge that liability of any person; provided
that, the personal and individual liability shall apply to each or every person
holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became obligated.
No person shall be personally and individually liable under this division (H)
who had no authority to collect, truthfully account for or pay over any tax

become or became due.
   (I)   Every employee receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax
imposed under §
110.03 of this chapter shall be personally liable for the tax notwithstanding
the provision of divisions (G) and (H) above. In all cases where the employer
does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee, such
employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the city each
quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer. If an employer fails
to or is not required to withhold, report or pay the license fee, it shall
become the duty of the employee to file with the city. The only employer that
is not required to withhold, report and pay the occupational license tax is the
Federal Government, including the United States Postal Service. The payment
required to be made by an employee, can be made quarterly, for the periods
ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, or at any
time the employee wishes to make an estimated payment for the year in which
wages are earned. All license fees must be received by February 28 for the
preceding calendar year, together with a copy of the employee’s W-2 form.
Employers not required to withhold, report, or pay the license fee must
annually during the month of January of each year, make a return to the
Occupational Tax Administrator, in which is set forth the name and Social
Security number of each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar
year, giving the amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation
earned during such preceding year by each such employee. This list shall
include all current full-time employees, part-time employees, temporary
employees and terminated employees whether it be voluntary or involuntary.

city intends to administer these regulations consistent with those regulations,
all as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (hereinafter, the “Act”),
47 U.S.C. § 543(b). Likewise, it is the city’s intention that the cable
operator be bound by the FCC regulations to the extent allowed by law.
   (C)   For the purposes of this chapter, “basic service” or “basic cable
service” and “cable operator” have the same meaning as defined by the Act and
FCC regulations. “Operator” shall have the same meaning as “cable operator”.

regulation, the operator shall file with the city a schedule of its current
rates for basic service and equipment and justification therefor. The operator
may, if it so chooses, file a proposal with appropriate justification for an
increase in its current rates. An INCREASE shall mean any change lessening the
number of channels or other service available as well as raising the rate for
basic service or equipment. The operator may, at any time thereafter, submit a
proposal to increase its rate, consistent with FCC regulations.
(Prior Code, § 119.03) (Ord. 18, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 117.04 SUPPORT FOR RATE FILINGS; BURDEN OF PROOF.
   (A)   The rate filing submitted by the operator, either for its current

reasonable and in compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations.
      (1)   If the operator asserts that its current rates or its proposed
rates are within the” benchmark” or “cap”, as defined by the FCC, it must fully
complete applicable FCC forms and otherwise provide material to support its
position.
      (2)   If the operator proposes to increase its rates above that level
permitted by the FCC “benchmark” or “cap”, it may seek to make a “cost-of-
service” showing in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the FCC.
In seeking to make a “cost-of-service” showing, the operator must fully
complete applicable FCC forms and otherwise provide material to supplement its
position.
      (3)   If the operator proposes to add or delete channels or service, or
to remove certain channels from the basic services to the cable programming

its rates, the operator may not therefore increase its rates for basic service
or equipment without the prior approval of the city. This requirement applies
in all cases, including increases it has announced, but not yet implemented
prior to the date it received notice of rate regulation from the city.

(Prior Code, § 119.07) (Ord. 18, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 117.08 SCHEDULE OF ACTION BY CITY; TOLLING PERIODS.
   (A)   After the operator has submitted a rate filing to justify its current
rates, or to seek an increase, the current rates shall remain in effect subject
to further action by the city.
   (B)   If the city takes no action within 30 days of the submission, to
approve, disapprove or toll the period of reviewing the rates, the current
rates or the proposed rates, as the case may be, shall be deemed approved;

toll the rates for an additional 90 days after the expiration of the initial 30
days.
      (2)   For filings seeking a rate increase based upon a cost-of-service
showing, the city may toll the rates for an additional 150 days after the
expiration of the initial 30 days. If City Council so desires, within 30 days
of receipt of a cost-of-service showing, it may ask the FCC pursuant to 47
C.F.R. § 76.7 to examine the cable operator’s showing. The city shall issue an
order stating that it is seeking Commission assistance and serve a copy of the
order on the cable operator before the 30-day deadline.
      (3)   If the rates are tolled with respect to current rates, the rates
may remain in effect subject to refund as specified in §
117.09 of this chapter. If the rates are tolled with the regard to a proposed
increase, the increase in rates shall not go into effect unless the city orders
that they shall go into effect subject to refund.
(Prior Code, § 119.08) (Ord. 18, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 117.09 RATES SUBJECT TO REFUNDS.
   (A)   If the city chooses to toll the period to review current rates, the
current rates will remain in effect subject to refund. In like manner, if the
city chooses to toll the period to review a proposed rate increase, it may
permit the proposed rate increase to go into effect subject to refund if
ordered by the City Council.
   (B)   If the city has taken no action at the end of the additional 90 or 150
days, the proposed rate increase shall go into effect subject to refund. In all
cases, the city shall issue a brief written order in accordance with 47 C.F.R.
§ 76.933, that the operator keep an accurate account of all amounts received by
reason of the rate of issue and on whose behalf such amounts are paid. Refunds
shall be paid to the full extent allowed by law.
(Prior Code, § 119.09) (Ord. 18, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 117.10 CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE.
   Within 90 days of any order of the city mandating a reduction in rates,
ordering a refund of rates, or prescribing rates at a level less than the rate
increase sought by the operator, the operator shall file with the city a
certification, signed by an authorized representative that it has fully
complied with the city’s order and describing in detail the steps taken to
implement the order and showing how refunds, including interest, were
calculated and distributed.
(Prior Code, § 119.10) (Ord. 18, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 117.11 PUBLIC HEARINGS.

expiration of any period under this chapter that would result in rates going
into effect subject to refund, the city shall hold a public hearing at which
interested parties may orally express their views or submit written comments.
The public hearings shall be held in such a manner as to convenience the city
and its citizens.
(Prior Code, § 119.11) (Ord. 18, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 117.12 INFLATION AND EXTERNAL COST ADJUSTMENTS.
   If the operator requests an increase in whole or in part based upon
inflation adjustments, programming cost increases, or other external factors
permitted by FCC regulations the operator shall provide a detailed explanation
and documentation in support of the request, including calculations as to how
the specific request was derived and a copy of the contract for each
programming service whose costs has increased. In addition, the operator shall
submit, through its Chief Financial Officer or an independent certified
accountant, a sworn statement that it has examined all external costs and
offset any claimed increase by any decrease that has occurred and has otherwise
complied with the requirements of 47 C.F.R. § 76.922(d)(2).
(Prior Code, § 119.12) (Ord. 18, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 117.13 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   (A)   The operator may request that portions of the filings and information
it supplies to the city in support of its current rates or a proposed rate
increase be kept confidential. Such request may be made solely as it relates to
proprietary information.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, PROPRIETARY INFORMATION is
information which if openly disclosed would permit an unfair commercial
advantage to competitors of the cable operator.
      (2)   If possible, the portions of the filing that are proprietary shall
be segregated from the non-proprietary information. The request that the
information be kept confidential must state the reason that the information
would permit an unfair commercial advantage to competitors of the cable
operator.
   (B)   The Mayor, or his or her designee, shall grant the request that the
information be kept confidential if he or she determines that the preponderance
of evidence shows disclosure would permit an unfair commercial advantage to
competitors of the cable operator. If the operator requests confidentiality and
the request is denied, the operator may withdraw its request for a rate
increase and the information it claims to be proprietary will be returned to
it.
   (C)   (1)   If the city requires any additional proprietary information
other than that provided by the operator in support of the rate filing, the
city shall state a justification for such additional information and where
related to an FCC Form 393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/1205) filing.
      (2)   The city shall indicate the question or section of the form to
which the request specifically relates.
   (D)   If the cable operator makes no request for confidentiality, the
material will be considered public records available for inspection by any
person pursuant to the commonwealth’s Open Records Law, being KRS 61.870 to
61.884.
(Prior Code, § 119.13) (Ord. 18, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 117.14 DECISION.
   (A)   After it completes its review of the rate firing submitted by the
operator, the city shall issue an order approving or disapproving the current
rates sought to be justified or the increased rates sought. If the city had
previously decided pursuant to §
117.08 or this chapter to allow rates to remain in effect or go into effect
subject to refund and, if the city disapproves the rates in question, it shall
issue an appropriate order directing that refunds be made. The city may order
such refunds to the full extent permitted by the FCC regulations.
   (B)   The city may order a reduction in rates where necessary to bring rates
into compliance with FCC regulations. If the city determines that the current
rate or a proposed rate is unreasonable, it may prescribe a reasonable rate.
   (C)   Before disapproving a rate or prescribing a rate or ordering a refund,
the city shall ensure that the operator has had notice and opportunity to
comment on the rate in question or refund. The city shall provide ten days’
written notice and give the operator the opportunity to submit written or oral
comments in addition to its rate filing.
   (D)   If the rates are disapproved in whole or in part, or the city
prescribes rates, or orders refunds, the order issued by the city shall specify
the reasons for the decision. The City Clerk shall provide written notice to
the operator of the city’s decision by providing a copy of the resolution or
order.
   (E)   The city’s decision approving or disapproving the rate in whole or in
part, or prescribing rates, may be appealed to the FCC or as otherwise allowed
by law by the operator or by any citizen who submitted oral or written comment
to the city prior to the order rendering the decision.
(Prior Code, § 119.14) (Ord. 18, passed 5-9-1994)
§ 117.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   The operator is required to comply with the terms and provisions of
this chapter. If the operator violates any order of the city with respect to
rates, it shall be subject to a fine of $500 a day for each day it fails to
comply.
   (B)   Violation of this chapter or any order with respect to rates may be
considered a violation of this franchise agreement between the operator and the
city.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 118.01 FINDINGS, DECLARATION OR PUBLIC POLICY AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   (1)   The City Council relies on such evidence of the adverse
secondary efforts of adult entertainment uses that is within the common
knowledge of municipalities and is widely reported in judicial opinions, media
reports, land use studies and crime impact reports made available to the
Council, several of which are set forth herein. Additionally, the Council
relies on repeated judicial findings validating municipalities’ reasonable
reliance on this body of secondary effects evidence to support time, place, and
manner regulations of sexually-oriented businesses. The Council relies upon and
incorporates the findings of secondary effects discussed in the following non-

      (2)   The Council further relies on reports concerning secondary effects
occurring in and around sexually-oriented businesses, including, but not
limited to, Phoenix, Arizona – 1979; Houston, Texas – 1997; Indianapolis,
Indiana – 1984; Amarillo, Texas – 1977; Garden Grove, California – 1991; Los
Angeles, California – 1977; Whittier, California – 1978; Austin, Texas – 1986;
Seattle, Washington – 1989; Tucson, Arizona – 1990; Testimony, Warner-Robins,
Georgia – 2000; Newport News, Virginia – 1996; St. Cloud, Minnesota – 1994; New
York Times Square study – 1994; Minnesota, State of – 1989; Phoeniz, Arizona –
1995-1998; and also on findings of physical abuse from the paper entitled
“Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence,” by
Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution
Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Based on cases and reports such as these,
the Council finds:
      (3)   Sexually-oriented adult entertainment businesses, as a category of
commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary
effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes,
prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency,
obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property
values, urban blight, pornographic litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (4)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, sometimes
occur at unregulated adult entertainment businesses, especially those which
provide private or semi-private booths, rooms or cubicles for view films,
videos or live sexually explicit shows, which acts constitute a public nuisance
and pose a risk to public health through the spread of sexually-transmitted
diseases.
      (5)   Adult entertainment businesses should be separated from sensitive
land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and
should be separated from other certain uses, such as other sexually-oriented
businesses and establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages to minimize
the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent a concentration
of sexually-oriented businesses and such uses.
      (6)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitute a harm
which the Council has a substantial government interest in abating and/or
preventing in the future.
      (7)   Adult entertainment activity tends to attract an undesirable
clientele which discourages neighboring residents form undertaking civic
improvements, causes residents and businesses to move elsewhere and frustrates
attempts to attract new residences and businesses to come into an area, all of
which factors contribute to a diminution of property values and to a general
deterioration of neighborhoods.
      (8)   The small closet-like rooms or “booths” at adult amusement arcades
in other communities have encouraged person to loiter for the purposes of
engaging in unlawful, often anonymous, sexual conduct and have encouraged lewd
conduct in public places, thereby creating public nuisances and generally
unsanitary and unhealthful conditions that create dangers to the public health,
welfare and safety.
      (9)   The concentration of sexually-explicit movies and books and sexual
paraphernalia in adult entertainment establishments which also house sexually
explicit movies, as well as hotel rooms rented by the hour to “couples”
afforded free sexually-explicit movies in the hotel room, have provided
prostitutes and appealing and visible meeting place to ply their trade and have
created public nuisances in otherwise respectable neighborhoods.
      (10)   Children, the family environment and residential neighborhoods
suffer injury from the deleterious effects and harmful consequences resulting
from the distribution of, and exposure to, certain sexually explicit items and
devices. This is particularly so when such items and devices are permitted to
leave a business’s premises and litter the immediate family environment,
neighborhood and certain areas where children are likely to be.
      (11)   The noise generated by patrons coming and going from adult
entertainment establishments causes a substantial disruption to nearby
residents and modest curtailment of the hours during which entertainment is
offered to patrons of such establishments would afford some relief to person
living in those nearby residences without significantly interfering with the
availability of adult entertainment.
      (12)   Nationally, there is extensive involvement of organized crime in
the business of adult bookstores and the disclosure of persons who own, as well
as the names of those persons who operate adult bookstores and other adult
entertainment establishments will aid law enforcement officials in the
enforcement of the Federal Racketeer Influences and Corrupt Organization Act
(RICO) and the enforcement of the laws of the commonwealth, among others,
prohibiting the distribution of obscene matter, the use of minors to distribute
obscene matter, the advertising of obscene material, the distribution of
obscene material to minors, promoting the sale of obscenity, the use of a minor
in a sexual performance, the distribution of material portraying a sexual
performance by a minor, the promoting of material portraying a sexual
performance by a minor and the advertising of material portraying a sexual
performance by a minor and the use of minors to distribute materials portraying
a sexual performance by a minor.
      (13)   The Council declares as a matter of public policy that in order to
preserve surrounding neighborhoods, to prevent blight and the deterioration of
the neighborhoods of the city, protect property values, promote the return of
residents and businesses to the neighborhoods, protect children form the
deleterious effects of exposure to sexually explicit material and decrease the
incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency, the licensing and regulation of
adult entertainment establishments is a public necessity and is required in the
interest of public health, safety and welfare as well as the economic and
aesthetic well-being of the people.
   (B)   (1)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to
prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually-oriented businesses
within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose, nor
effect, of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable
access to any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material:
         (a)   To prevent the unsanitary conditions which exist at “adult
amusement arcades” and to prevent health risks, including AIDS and other
sexually-transmitted diseases, caused by illicit and unlawful sexual relations
in such public establishments;
         (b)   To protect children and the family environment from the
deleterious and harmful effects of exposure to certain sexually explicit items
and devices; and
         (c)   To obtain the identity of person licensed and to be licensed for
the operation of establishments selling, showing, renting or offering certain
sexually explicit material or entertainment to ensure property identification
of those persons responsible for the operation of such businesses so as to
assist in the proper enforcement of this chapter.
      (2)   It is not the purpose of this chapter to establish community
standards on obscenity, nor to permit persons or entities to engage in any
activity which is in violation of law, including but not limited to, state laws
pertaining to the advertising, promotion, distribution or sale of obscene
matter or matters portraying a sexual performance by a minor, or state laws
pertaining to the use of a minor in a sexual performance or promotion of sexual
performance by a minor, or the use of a minor to distribute material portraying
sexual performance by a minor.

   (D)   The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have effect on the
revocation of the license; provided, however, that, any reversal of a
conviction shall automatically eliminate that conviction from consideration in
this chapter.
   (E)   When, after the notice and hearing procedure described in division (F)
below, the Director revokes a license, the revocation shall continue for one
year and the licensee shall not be issued an adult entertainment establishment
license or an employee license for one year from the date revocation becomes
effective; provided that, if the conditions of division (G) below are met, a
provisional license will be granted pursuant to that division (G) below.
   (F)   If facts exist for denial, suspension or revocation of an adult
entertainment establishment license or an employee license issued under this
chapter, the Director shall notify the applicant or licensee (respondent) in
writing of the intent to deny, suspend or revoke the license, including the
grounds therefor, by personal delivery or by certified mail. The notification
shall be directed to the most current business address on file with the
Director, and will provide the address of the Hearing Board to which the
respondent should direct his or her response. Within five working days of
receipt of such notice, the respondent may provide to the Hearing Board, in
writing, a response that shall include a statement of reasons why the license
or permit should not be denied, suspended or revoked. Within three working days
of the receipt of respondent’s written response, the Hearing Board shall notify
respondent in writing of the hearing date on respondent’s denial, suspension or
revocation proceeding.
      (1)   Within ten working days of the receipt of respondent’s written
response, the Hearing Board shall conduct a hearing at which respondent shall

proceeding shall be transcribed or recorded. Within ten working days after any
hearing, the Hearing Board shall issue a written decision on the matter and
mail such decision to the respondent by certified mail no later than five
working days after the date of such decision.
      (2)   (a)   If a response is not received by the Hearing Board in the
time stated or, if after hearing, the Hearing Board finds that grounds as
specified in this chapter exist for denial, suspension or revocation, then such
denial, suspension or revocation shall become final five working days after the
Hearing Board sends, by certified mail, the written decision and notice that
the license has been denied, suspended or revoked.
         (b)   Such notice shall include a statement advising the applicant or
licensee of the right to appeal such decision to a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (G)   (1)   When a decision to deny, suspend or revoke a license becomes
final, the applicant or licensee (aggrieved party) whose application for a
license has been denied, or whose licenses has been suspended or revoked, shall
have the right to appeal such action to a court of competent jurisdiction
within 15 working days of the date of the adverse decision becomes final. Until
the time for an appeal has passed, any temporary license issued to the
aggrieved party under this chapter shall remain in effect throughout the
administrative proceedings described in this section. Upon the filing of any
court action to appeal, challenge, restrain or otherwise enjoin the enforcement
of the denial, suspension or revocation, the Director shall immediately issue
the aggrieved a provisional license and shall file the record of the
administrative proceeding with the reviewing court within ten business days
after he or she receives notice of said action.
      (2)   The provisional license shall allow the aggrieved party to continue
operation of the adult entertainment establishment or to continue employment as
an adult entertainment employee, as the case may be, and will expire upon the
court’s entry of a judgment on the merits of the aggrieved party’s action to
appeal, challenge, restrain or otherwise enjoin the enforcement of the
Director’s decision.

§ 118.43 SCIENTER NECESSARY TO PROVE LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not impose strict liability for violations of its
provisions. Where any provision or offense herein fails to state a necessary
level of culpability to establish a violation or liability, the offense shall
be established upon a showing that the person acted knowingly or recklessly
with regard to the predicate act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for
the purposes of this chapter, an act by an employee shall be imputed to the
adult entertainment licensee for the purpose of establishing a violation of
this chapter, or for purposes of license denial, modification, or revocation
only if a licensee allowed, either knowingly or by reckless failure to
supervise, a violation of this chapter to occur. It shall be a defense to
liability that the adult entertainment establishment licensee was powerless to
prevent the violation.
(Ord. 23-2011, passed 11-21-2011)
§ 118.44 FAILURE OF OFFICIAL TO MEET TIME FRAME; APPLICANT OR LICENSEE RIGHTS.

thing pursuant to this chapter within a prescribed time, and fails to take such
act or such thing within the time prescribed, said failure shall not prevent
the exercise of constitutional rights of an applicant or licensee. If the act
required of the official under this chapter, but not completed in the time
prescribed, includes approval of condition(s) necessary for approval by the
city of an applicant or licensee’s employee license (including a renewal), the
applicant or licensee shall be deemed to have satisfied the condition(s) for
which approval was sought.

   (A)   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be subject
to a civil penalty of not less than $100, nor more than $1,000 as imposed by
the Director. Each day that a violation continues after notice has been served
shall be deemed a separate offense. Any person cited pursuant to this division
(A) and assessed a civil penalty shall have the right to appeal such penalty to
the Hearing Board in accordance with the Code Enforcement Board ordinance. The
process for said appeal shall be governed by §§ 
34.065 through
34.081 of this code of ordinance.
   (B)   Notwithstanding division (A) above, any person who violates any
provision of this chapter or who knowingly provides false information in an

Any person cited hereunder for a failure to meet a requirement hereof may be
cited again for said failure one or more days after a prior citation and in
such case each citation shall constitute a separate offense.
   (C)   In addition to the penalties provided herein for violations of this
chapter, the Director is authorized to pursue remedial civil action for
violations of this chapter by civil complaint or petition for injunctive
relief, declaration of rights or other appropriate proceeding filed in the

§ 119.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is the protection of public health and safety in
the city, through prevention and control of hazardous materials, incidents and
releases, to require the timely reporting of releases and to provide for the
reimbursement to the city for legitimate expenses for emergency responses by
the city.
(Prior Code, § 121.01) (Ord. 13-2000, passed 8-21-2000)
§ 119.02 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter shall apply to all persons who manufacture, use, handle or
store hazardous materials in quantities prescribed by this chapter and as
defined herein, within the city.
(Prior Code, § 121.02) (Ord. 13-2000, passed 8-21-2000)
§ 119.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AUTHORIZED RELEASE.
      (1)   A release which is a federally permitted release under 42 U.S.C. §
9601(10);
      (2)   A release to waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines
which is exempt from notification under 40 C.F.R. §§ 117.11 through 117.14;
      (3)   The introduction of any pollutant into a publicly-owned treatment
works (POTW) which is not in violation of applicable pretreatment regulations
controlling the introduction of pollutants into the publicly-owned treatment
works; or
      (4)   Any release which is specifically authorized by a local, state or
federal agency, to facilitate life safety objectives and/or overall control of
a hazardous materials emergency.
   CONSUMER PRODUCT. The meaning stated in 15 U.S.C. § 2052.
   COST RECOVERY.
      (1)   Cost associated with hazardous materials responses include
equipment that is disposed of, rather the re-used, the cost of qualifying the
contaminants and securing legal disposal methods and equipment which must be
replaced to ensure readiness for the next release. In addition, hazardous
materials releases involve additional staffing, either at the scene of the
release for control, isolation of the area, or evacuation of citizens or
employees; or as long-term stand-by personnel at department stations to provide
the normal coverage for other emergency situations that may arise in the
community during a hazardous materials release.
      (2)   Affected departments could include Fire, Police, Water/Wastewater,
Public Works, Natural Gas and Recreation.
      (3)   It is the city’s intent that shelter needs be provided by private
disaster relief agencies, whenever possible, however, costs could be incurred
for evacuees including food, water and personal hygiene materials.
      (4)   Cost recovery includes those amounts charged to the generator of a
spill or release of hazardous materials, by the city or its departments, to
replace equipment utilized (that is not reusable) or requires decontamination
(with associated fees). Also, the city will bill total standard overtime
salaries for non-“technician” employees. “Technician” level city employees (as
defined in OSHA, 29 C.F.R. § 1910.120) shall be billed to the generator of a
spill or release at a rate of $50 per hour/per technician at the scene of a
hazardous material incident; provided, they are actively engaged in leak
control, monitoring, rescue, “back-up” for leak control or monitoring teams,
decontamination or are hourly employees serving at management levels or as
support personnel with the incident command structure. Additional staff,
“called-back”, who are standing by at their respective fire stations shall be
considered as normally on-duty until the number exceeds that defined as normal
staffing for that shift at the beginning of that work day. Any excess “called-
back” personnel will be billed to the generator of a spill or release at a rate
of $15 per hour/per person.
      (5)   It is not a legal requirement that the city provide these emergency
technical services to its citizens and business community; however, it is
within the scope of modern community protection to procure equipment, train
personnel and provide and increased level of response for hazardous materials
incidents, where feasible. This feasibility for the city is dependent upon
total cost recovery for equipment and supplies used and overtime salaries
incurred by its departments during a hazardous materials incident.
   EMPLOYEE. Any person who works, with or without compensation, in a
workplace.
   EMPLOYER. Any person, firm, corporation, partnership, association,

(Ord. 34-2022, passed 11-7-2022)
§ 120.15 REGULATORY LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   A regulatory license fee is imposed on the gross receipts of sale of
alcoholic beverages of each license issued by the City ABC Administrator. Said
license fee shall be set by the City Council in the annual budget for each
fiscal year and such percentage rate shall be established to generate revenue
that does not exceed the total of the reasonable expenses actually incurred by
the city in the previous fiscal year for the additional cost, as demonstrated
by reasonable evidence, of policing, regulation and administration as the
result of the sale of alcoholic beverages within the city. Such fee shall be in
addition to any other tax, fee or license permitted by law, but a credit
against such fee shall be allowed in the amount equal to the license or fee
imposed and such regulatory fee shall be applied annually from July 1 to June
30.
   (B)   For retail drink license, quota retail package license and limited
golf course license, payment of such regulatory fees shall be remitted to the
City ABC Administrator, and shall accompany the alcohol regulatory fee returns
approved for such use by the city. These returns and payments are due monthly
by the twentieth day of the following month at which time one-twelfth of the
annual fees shall be deducted as a credit. Regulatory fee form is due by above
date even if no fee is due, and will be subject to fines. (See division (H) of
this section).
   (C)   For all other licenses, payment of such regulatory fees shall be
remitted to the City ABC Administrator, and shall accompany the alcohol
regulatory fee returns approved for such use by the city. These returns and
payments are due no later than by the end of the month immediately following
each calendar quarter at which time one-fourth of the annual fees shall be
deducted as a credit. (Due April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31).
Regulatory fee form is due by above date even if no fee is due, and will be
subject to fines. (See division (H) of this section).
   (D)   Failure to pay such quarterly remittance within ten days of the due
date constitutes a violation and subjects licensee to suspension or revocation
of their license.
   (E)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay monthly remittance by the
due date is 5% of the fee for each 30 days or fraction thereof. The total late
filing penalty shall not exceed 25% of the fee, provided, however, in no case
shall the penalty be less than $10.
   (F)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay quarterly remittance by
the due date is 5% of the fee for each 90 days or fraction thereof. The total
late filing penalty shall not exceed 25% of the fee, provided, however, in no
case shall the penalty be less than $10.
   (G)   Interest at the rate of 8% per annum will apply to any late payments.
   (H)   If regulatory fee form is due, but no payment is applicable and the
form is late, a flat late fee of $50 will apply. If not received within ten
days from due date, $100 late fee will apply. Anything past due, this period
will be subject to suspension.
(Ord. 34-2022, passed 11-7-2022)
§ 120.16 CHANGE OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of a
corporation, it is necessary that stock ownership changes in such corporation
be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The City ABC Administrator can
therefore, investigate the person to whom the stock is transferred in order to
ascertain whether that person is precluded by statute from holding an interest
in an alcoholic beverage license.
   (B)   As used herein, the word CHANGE is construed to include any change in
directors or officers of the corporation, or change in ownership of stock
whereby any person secures 10% of the outstanding stock. Transfer of more than
10% of the total stock shall require a new license.
   (C)   (1)   The following information will be required concerning any new
director, officer or person securing any interest in alcoholic beverage
license:
         (a)   Name and address;
         (b)   Nature of interest;
         (c)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         (d)   Date of birth;
         (e)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of
Kentucky. If a city resident, indicate when residence was established in the
city;
         (f)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license
or corporation or partnership holding a license under this act;
         (g)   Extent of stock ownership; and
         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or
corporation or partnership holding a license in any other state or province.
      (2)   This information shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator as
an amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was granted.
(Ord. 34-2022, passed 11-7-2022)
§ 120.17 DORMANCY.
   (A)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after 90 days of no business activity. Such is the intent
of this subchapter. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have
business interrupted by situations not under the licensee’s control; various
exceptions to the dormancy rule have been included in this subchapter.
   (B)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of
90 days shall become null and void. At the expiration of the 90-day period, the
license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
   (C)   Except that, the provisions of division (B) above shall not apply to
any licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a
license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing
lease. Such licensee shall furnish to the City ABC Administrator a verified
statement setting forth the fact that the licensee is unable to continue in
business prior to theexpiration of the 90 days of inactivity, for any of the
reasons set forth herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an extension
of the dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect during the
license period or until same is transferred to another premises,
notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted during said period;
provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid unless business is
conducted thereunder within 12 months from the date of notice to the City ABC
Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date, but may
be for such times as the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate.
(Ord. 34-2022, passed 11-7-2022)
§ 120.18 RENEWAL OF LICENSE.
   All renewal licenses must be on file with the City ABC Administrator within
14 days prior to the expiration of the licenses for the preceding license
period or the same shall be canceled, except where the licensee is unable to
continue in business at the same premises licensed during the preceding license
prior due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or
threatened acquisition of these premises by any federal, state, city or other
governmental agency or private corporation, possessing power of eminent domain,
whether such acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through
failure of landlord to renew existing lease; then said licensee shall file a
written verified statement no less than 20 days prior to the expiration date of
the license, setting forth these facts. The City ABC Administrator is hereby
authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a
reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the City ABC
Administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay the scheduled license
fee from the expiration date of the former license or licenses. Said license
fee shall not be payable until application is made for the transfer of said
license to a new location.

been approved for occupancy by the city’s Building Official, and any and all
other inspections required by the state’s Building Code are completed.
(Ord. 34-2022, passed 11-7-2022)
§ 120.20 DELINQUENT TAXES OR FEES.
   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be granted or renewed
to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any taxes or fees due the
city at the time of the issuing of the license; nor shall any license be
granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or property, owned and occupied by
the licensee upon which there are any delinquent taxes or fees due the city.
Further, if a licensee becomes delinquent in the payment of any taxes or any
fees due the city at any time during the license period, the license to sell

(Prior Code, § 126.09) (Ord. 22-2007, passed 4-23-2007)
§ 121.10 PROCEDURE FOR APPLYING FOR REFUND FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   (A)   Any taxpayer (pursuant to this subchapter) who truly believes that he
or she has made or permitted an overpayment of his or her liability for any
restaurant tax required by this subchapter may apply for refund of said
overpayment provided that he or she files an amended return, verified under
oath and setting forth in detail the full explanation of the reason of the said
claimed overpayment of his or her liability, within one year of the date of
said overpayment is made or the date he or she said restaurant tax payment was
due, whichever occurs first.
   (B)   If a refund has been properly claimed according to the provisions of
division (A) above, then the city’s Director of Finance shall have the
authority to honor and refund any such overpayment actually made above
liability upon the restaurant tax required under this subchapter which he or
she determines, within his or her sole discretion, was made through honest
mistake or inadvertence.
   (C)   In no event shall any refund be made for any payment upon any
restaurant tax unless the refund claim is submitted and filed in strict
compliance with the foregoing provisions of this section upon such refund claim
forms or amended return forms as hereafter shall be promulgated by the city’s
Director of Finance from time to time.
(Prior Code, § 126.10) (Ord. 22-2007, passed 4-23-2007)
§ 121.11 FAILURE TO FILE RETURN; FAILURE TO PAY THE RESTAURANT TAX WITHHELD;
UNDERPAYMENT OF AMOUNT DUE.
   (A)   (1)   If the taxpayer liable for collecting the restaurant tax and
filing a return fails to make a return, the city’s Director of Finance shall
prepare an estimate of the amount of restaurant taxes due based on the best
information available to them. The city’s Director of Finance may make
investigations to assist in making the estimate. He or she may consider the
volume of business done in the same type of business, and any other relevant
maters.
      (2)   When the city’s Director of Finance estimates the restaurant taxes,
the amount of interest and late charges provided by this subchapter shall be
added to the taxes due. He or she shall notify the taxpayer of the amount due.
Such notification shall be in writing and shall contain a brief description of
the method and estimated figures used in arriving at the estimated tax. Any
taxpayer may dispute the amount of the estimated tax by filing within 30 days
of notification of the estimated taxes a return accompanied by payment of the
entire balance due together with the interest and late charges due. Such return
shall be processed like any late return, and shall establish the restaurant tax
liability of the taxpayer in place of the estimated amount prepared by the
city’s Director of Finance.
      (3)   However, the city’s Director of Finance may later determine that
the amount shown in the return is insufficient so there is a deficiency, in the
same manner as in the case of other returns.
   (B)   (1)   If the city’s Director of Finance determines, by examining
available evidence, that the amount of restaurant taxes paid over by the
taxpayer is less than the amount required by this subchapter, he or she shall
notify the taxpayer of the deficiency. The city’s Director of Finance may use
any of the methods authorized in division (A) above to determine whether a
deficiency exists and to determine the amount of such deficiency. He or she
shall thereupon notify the taxpayer of the deficiency. Such notice shall be in
writing and shall state not only the amount of the deficiency, but also the
methods and estimates used in arriving at the amount of the deficiency
      (2)    If the taxpayer does not object in writing within 30 days of the
date of receiving such notice, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have accepted
the revised figures for the restaurant tax liability. If the taxpayer does file
written objection within the time specified, the taxpayer shall pay the fees,
together with penalties and interest, under protest and may thereupon pursue
administrative and judicial remedies as provided by this subchapter and by
state law to seek a refund.
   (C)   If the city’s Director of Finance finds that any taxpayer has
overpaid, he or she shall notify them of overpayment and shall refund the
amount of the overpayment to them.
   (D)   When the city’s Director of Finance notifies any taxpayer of any
estimated amount due, alleged overpayment or refund, he or she shall include in
the notice clear instructions on how, when and where the taxpayer may protect
or appeal the decision.
   (E)   (1)   If any taxpayer or any person, firm, association or corporation
required by this subchapter to pay a restaurant tax or to file a return shall
fail to file any return for any month, such failure to file shall constitute a
continuing offense against the city and the city’s Director of Finance may
proceed to estimate and collect the restaurant taxes at any time.
      (2)   In all other cases, no increases shall be made in the taxpayer’s
restaurant tax liability unless the first notice of such increase is received
by the taxpayer within three years of the time the return was first due.

§ 132.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   FALSE ALARMS. The activation of any mechanical, burglary, robbery, security
or fire alarm system for the purpose of summoning police and/or fire personnel,
or which causes one or more police or fire personnel to be dispatched or
summoned to a particular location within the city, when, in fact, no crime,
fire or other emergency has, or is being attempted or committed, on the
premises.
   PREVENTABLE FALSE ALARM. The careless activation of any police security or
fire alarm by any individual, or activation of any police security or fire
alarm system proximately caused by the failure of the owner, lessee, operator
or occupant, or their contractor or agent, to properly design, install or
reasonably maintain the security or alarm system in a safe operating condition.
Police security or fire alarms shall not be deemed a PREVENTABLE FALSE ALARM in
violation of this chapter if it is determined by the Chief of Police, Chief of
the Fire Department, or their designees, that the alarm was caused by:
      (1)   A act of vandalism causing physical damage to the premises;
      (2)   Alarms occurring during electrical storms, tornadoes, blizzards or
other acts of God where there is evidence of damage or disruption to the alarm
system;
      (3)   Electrical power or telephone circuit disruption beyond the control
of the alarm company and/or user; or
      (4)   Any and all other acts or omission by persons, or events beyond the
reasonable control of the owner, lessee, operator or occupant of the premises
and the security alarm system.
(Prior Code, § 132.01) (Ord. 13-2002, passed 8-5-2002)
§ 132.02 UNLAWFUL FALSE ALARMS; NOTICE AND DUTY TO INSPECT, REPAIR AND INITIATE
TRAINING AFTER FIVE PREVENTABLE FALSE ALARMS.
   (A)   Prohibition; preventable false alarms. It shall be unlawful for any
person to activate, initiate, transmit or otherwise cause, authorize or allow
more than five “preventable false alarms” at the same location within a six-
month period.
   (B)   Notice and corrective action requirement.
      (1)   General. If the Police or Fire Department, through their respective
designees, have probable cause to believe that five preventable false alarms
have occurred at the same location within a six-month period, the Chief of the
respective department, or his or her designee, shall within 48 hours of having
established probable cause, notify the property owner or other entity, user or
person in charge of the alarm system, in writing (by delivering said notice in
person or by certified mail, return receipt requested), of the nature and
number of preventable false alarms that have occurred to date, including a
brief description of the date and circumstances of each preventable false
alarm, and shall further advise the property owner, entity, user or person in
control of the alarm system, that any additional preventable false alarms after
this period of correction provided in division (B)(2) below shall constitute a
violation of this chapter for which the offender may be subject to prosecution
or civil penalty. Therefore, a compliance status with zero preventable alarms
shall be maintained for at least six months to avoid additional penalty.
      (2)   Duty to inspect and repair. Upon written notification from the
Police or Fire Departments, through then-respective designee, of the occurrence
of five preventable false alarms within a six-month period, the property owner,
entity, user or person in control of the police or fire security alarm system
in question, shall have the alarm system inspected by a representative of the
manufacturer of the alarm system or a qualified and reputable representative of
a fire and security alarm system dealer, to determine if the false alarms are
the result of mechanical failure, malfunction, improper design, installation,
lack of proper maintenance or human error due to carelessness or lack of
training. The inspection report shall note any and all deficiencies believed to
exist in the professional opinion of the qualified inspector, and what repairs
or other corrective action the inspector believes is required to render the
alarm system safe, operational and functional in relation to the type of
property or business it was designed and intended to secure. It shall be the
responsibility of the property owner, entity, user or other person in control
of the alarm system to make the necessary repairs and/or take any and all other
remedial measures reasonably identified and required by the qualified
inspector, and to submit a copy of the inspection report along with written
proof of the repairs and/or remedial action taken to correct any malfunctions
or deficiencies identified in the alarm system to the Police or Fire
Departments from whom the original notice was received, within 14 days of
receipt of the formal notification required in division (B)(1) above.
      (3)   Duty to train and provide orientation to employees and occupants.
Upon written notification from the Police or Fire Departments, through their
respective designee, of the occurrence of five preventable false alarms within
a six-month period, the property owner, entity, user or person in control of
the police or fire security alarm system in question, shall provide system
operation instruction to all system operators or potential authorized users of
the premises, and shall provide written documentation of the framing to the
Police or Fire Departments from whom the original notice was received, within
14 days of receipt of the formal notification required in division (B)(1)
above.
   (C)   Exception. A false alarm shall not be deemed a “preventable false
alarm” under the prohibition in division (A) above if it occurs at a location
for which the property owner, entity, user or person in control of the alarm
system has been formally notified to inspect and repair any malfunctions or
deficiencies in accordance with divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) above; provided
that, the false alarm occurs within the time period prescribed for the alarm
system to be inspected and repaired, if necessary.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the commonwealth has, in KRS 82.082, delegated to local
government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City
Council hereby adopts the following floodplain management chapter, as follows.
(Prior Code, § 151.01) (Ord. 27-2007, passed 7-16-2007; Ord. 32-2007, passed 9-
17-2007)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard area of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood loses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstruction
in floodplains causing increased in flood heights and velocity, and by the
location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise
unprotected from flood damage.
(Prior Code, § 151.02) (Ord. 27-2007, passed 7-16-2007)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion of flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Prior Code, § 151.03) (Ord. 27-2007, passed 7-16-2007)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
   (G)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Prior Code, § 151.04) (Ord. 27-2007, passed 7-16-2007)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood area (SFHA) in which the principle
source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination of both.
In A ZONES, flood waters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not
a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base flood
elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principle
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING BUILDING). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls is new construction.
   AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual chance flood
(100-year flood). Base flood elevation (BFEs) are determined.
   AH ZONES. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONES. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO AND AR/A ZONES. Special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   A99 ZONE. The part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths from one to three feet,
there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate; and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year. (Also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD.) BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30 AR/AH and AR/AO
that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1%
or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground,
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank or other human-made
facilities or infrastructures. See definition for STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular
program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated or qualified community
official) from available technical studies, historical information and other
available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by
flood waters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not
limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to
avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and
equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations or permanent storage
of materials or equipment.

the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized
rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date
of the initial FIRM.
   ENCLOSURE. The portion of a structure below the base flood elevation (BFE)
used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage or access to the
structure.
   ENCROACHMENT. The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth,
fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a
floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before 1-1-1975, for FIRMS
effective before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to as
EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the city based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD. The flood that has a 0.2% chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to
low risk of flooding.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source;
      (3)   Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to
a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas,
as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of
the current; and
      (4)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which
results in flooding.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). A map which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing
flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and/or the Flood Boundary
Floodway Map (FBFM) and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by flood waters from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency
preparedness plans, flood-control works, floodplain management ordinances and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOOD-PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOOD-PROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stated that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is water-tight to a specified design
elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated
debris impact forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet about the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components and the like.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
151.28 of this chapter, the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100
years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair or seafood processing facilities. This term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit (i.e., county or municipality) that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood-routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a building.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the Natural Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminary determined by
the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).
      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, flood-proof, demolish
or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KRS 151.250 - PLANS FOR DAMS, LEVEES, ETC TO BE APPROVED AND PERMIT ISSUED
BY CABINET - (ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC PROTECTION CABINET).
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the Cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the Cabinet, by regulation, may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to require approval
by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the state
shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris or any other material,
or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building, barrier or
obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or stream or in
the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising or obstruction will in
any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the floodway of the
stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been submitted to and
approved by the Cabinet and a permit issued as required in division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the Cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same,
except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the
Cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources
in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so
notified. The Department for Natural Resources, through KRS Ch. 350, shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Ch. 151 concerning the regulation of dams,
levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills or other obstructions across or
along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Ch. 350 for surface coal mining operations.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to

showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA
amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, show changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations and planimetric features.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION-FILL (LOMR F). A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   LEVEE. A human-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to

flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood-resistant material, void
of utilities, except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support or
basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of
construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or
landscaping reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure’s foundation
system.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided that, such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required utilities. The

(FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter
suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.
(The letter “A” is not used by FEMA; the letter “B” is the first revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or
adjusted assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. The average height of the sea for all stages of the tide.
For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used as a
reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as shown on
a community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with
either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North American Vertical
Datum (NAVD) 1988.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures and to minimize the costs of

or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.
mudflow) damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans,

§ 151.13 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION NOTICE.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at the time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which would be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator may issue a
citation to the offender stating the violation, prior notices of violation
issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development into
conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within what
period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or penalties are
recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to who the citation is
issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date the citation
is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set forth in the
citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or requesting a
hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the citation is issued
does not respond to the citation within seven days, that person shall be deemed
to have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a violation
occurred shall be considered final.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 151.25 DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Council hereby appoints the Director of Storm Water Management to
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting or
denying development permits in accordance with it provisions, and is herein
referred to as the “Floodplain Administrator”.
(Prior Code, § 151.25) (Ord. 27-2007, passed 7-16-2007)
§ 151.26 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
151.07 of this chapter. Application for a development permit shall be made on
forms furnished by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development
activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in
duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing.
Endorsement of local administrator is required before a state floodplain
construction permit can be processed. Specifically, the following information
is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§
151.41(B) and
151.43(B) of this chapter; and
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood- proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH and A
Zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

advise permittee that additional federal and state permits may be required and,
if specific federal or state permit requirements are known, require that copies
of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the development permit;
         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner; and
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, ADVERSELY
AFFECTS means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with §
151.07 of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer provisions for
flood hazard reduction. Any such information shall be submitted to the City
Council for adoption.
      (3)   Notification of other agencies.
         (a)   Notify adjacent communities, the commonwealth’s Division of
Water and any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory
authority prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse;
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and
         (c)   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      (4)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
         (a)   Certification required by §
151.41(A) of this chapter (lowest floor elevations) as shown on a completed and
certified elevation certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
or substantially improved structures, in accordance with §
151.26(B) of this chapter;
         (b)   Certification required by §
151.41(B) of this chapter (elevation or floodproofing of non-residential
structures) as shown on a completed and certified flood-proofing certificate.
Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which
the new or substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed, in
accordance with §
151.26(B) of this chapter;
         (c)   Certification required by §
151.41(C) of this chapter (elevated structures);
         (d)   Certification of elevation required by §
151.44(A) of this chapter (subdivision standards);
         (e)   Certification required by §
151.41(E) of this chapter (floodway encroachments);
         (f)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
not diminished;
         (g)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance; and
         (h)   Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in
§§
151.13 and
151.99 of this chapter.
      (5)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
151.28(C)(2) of this chapter;
         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
151.07 of this chapter, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonable utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available
from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provision for
flood hazard reduction.
         (c)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
151.41(B), a flood-proofing certificate; and
         (d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall
be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and shall be open
for public inspections.
      (6)   Right of entry.
         (a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, or whenever the Administrator has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any
condition or ordinance violation which makes such building, structure or
premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Administrator may enter such
building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or
perform any duty imposed upon the Administrator by this chapter.
         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, he or she shall
first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure
or premises are unoccupied, he or she shall first make reasonable effort to
locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such request
entry.
         (c)   If entry is refused, the Administrator shall have recourse to
every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
         (d)   When the Administrator shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or
occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building,
structure or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the Administrator for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter.
      (7)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the Administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her agent, or to the
person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be
resumed.
      (8)   Revocation of permits.
         (a)   The Administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued under
the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false statement or
misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or plans on which
the permit or approval was based.
         (b)   The Administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by the
Administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this chapter.
      (9)   Liability. Any officer, employee or member of the Floodplain
Administrator’s staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for
the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his or her duties, shall
not thereby render himself or herself personally liable, and is hereby relieved
from all personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or
property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his
or her duties. Any suit brought against any officer, employee or member because
of such act performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this
chapter shall be defended by the Department of Law until the final termination
of the proceedings.
      (10)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A floodplain
construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the
holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced construction
within 180 calendar days from the date of its issuance by the Floodplain
Administrator.
(Prior Code, § 151.27) (Ord. 27-2007, passed 7-16-2007)
§ 151.28 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property which physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to
the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare.
The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be
met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that
must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are
designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a
variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The City Council shall
establish an Appeal Board consisting of the City Engineer, Director of Planning
and Development, the Executive Assistant to the Mayor and one designated member
of the City Council.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the county’s Circuit Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need to grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance
is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood hazard. In
the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be made that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic
character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined herein), cause fraud
or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition section) or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use; provided that, the provisions hereof are satisfied
and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional
threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any application to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the County Clerk and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variances actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall be issued
within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.

17-2007)
FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 151.40 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
   (B)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use
of over-the-top or fame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
by materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
   (D)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
   (F)   Within Zones AH and AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (G)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
   (H)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
   (I)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (J)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure,
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the
requirements of “new construction”, as contained in this chapter.
   (K)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure,
which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall be
undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(Prior Code, § 151.40) (Ord. 27-2007, passed 7-16-2007)
§ 151.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data has been
provided, as set forth in §
151.07 of this chapter, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction.
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor including
basement, mechanical equipment and ductwork elevated no lower than one foot
above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used
to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of
division (C) below.
         (a)   In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height exceeding the depth number of specified in feet on the FIRM by at least
one foot, or elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade if
no depth number is specified.
         (b)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Ch. 4, Reg. 060, states as a part
of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: “the applicant
shall provide cross-sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby
base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are
not available. All cross-sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and
shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than plus five-tenths (+0.5)
foot. Cross-sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent
significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of
the base floodplain change. Each cross-section shall extend across the entire
base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by
the Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not
occur, the Cabinet may require additional cross-sections or specific site
elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory
floodway boundary calculations”.
         (c)   In all other zones, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least
one foot above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the Community Building Inspection
Department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   (a)   Freeboard requirements add height above the base flood
elevation to account for future flood fringe development, uncertainties
inherent with the methodologies, lack of data, debris that accompanies the base
flood, and flood levels higher than that of the base flood. A freeboard
requirement means that new construction and substantial improvements of
existing structures will be protected to a level higher than the base flood
elevation.
         (b)   Freeboard is applied not just to the elevation of the lowest
floor or flood- proofing level, but also to the level of protection provided to
all components of the structure. All structure utilities, including ductwork,
must be elevated or protected to the freeboard level and all portions of the
structure below the freeboard level must be constructed using materials
resistant to flood damage. If the lowest floor of garages or accessory
structures is below the freeboard level, the structure must meet the opening
requirements of division (C) below.
      (4)   Two references on these requirements are Protecting Building
Utilities from Flood Damage, FEMA-348, and Flood Resistant Materials
Requirements, FIA-TB-2.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or non-residential structure
(including manufactured home used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) above or together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be flood-proofed below an elevation one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is water-tight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and
ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
elevation;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
151.26(A)(3) of this chapter;
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) below;
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood-resistant materials below an
elevation one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood water. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin
1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices; provided that, they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood water.
   (C)   Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts or pilings (e.g., that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation) shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or
higher than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator);
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms;
      (4)   The total floor area of all such enclosed areas shall not exceed
300 square feet; and
         (5)   For enclosures greater than seven feet in interior height, where
elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest adjacent grade, a copy
of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the conversion of the area
below the lowest floor to a use or dimension contrary to the structures’
originally approved design, shall be presented as a condition of issue of the
final certificate of occupancy.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction, including
elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
         (a)   On individual lots or parcels;
         (b)   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (c)   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
         (d)   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (e)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; or
         (f)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood,
      (2)   All manufactured homes must be:
         (a)   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
         (b)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the
level of the base flood elevation; and
         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (3)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
         (a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
so that either the:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (4)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-30,
AO, AH and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must either:
         (a)   Be on the site fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         (c)   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this
chapter including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured
homes”.
      (5)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed
and insured in accordance with the state motor vehicle regulations, is on it
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
151.07 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If this division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this subchapter.
   (F)   Standards for utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
         (a)   Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
         (b)   Discharge from the system into flood waters.
      (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them, or contamination from them during flooding.
   (G)   Structures elevated on fill. A residential or non-residential
structure may be constructed on permanent fill in accordance with the
following.
      (1)   The lowest floor (including basement) of the structure or addition
shall be no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting and should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of
the structure before sloping below the base flood elevation, said slope being
no greater than a two to one (2:1) ratio unless a stability analysis is
provided by a registered professional engineer.
      (3)   The top of the fill shall be no lower than one foot above the base
flood elevation. However, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a structural
engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the structure from damage
due to erosion, scour and other hydrodynamic forces.
      (4)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
      (5)   All new structures built on fill must be constructed on properly
designed and compacted fill (ASTM D-698 or equivalent) that extends beyond the
building walls before dropping below the base flood elevation and has
appropriate protection from erosion and scour. The design of the fill or the
fill standard must be approved by a licensed professional engineer.
      (6)   If the community adopts and enforces the soil testing and
compaction requirements set fourth by the Standard, Uniform or National
Building Codes or the International Residential and Building Codes, it may
qualify for additional CRS credit.
   (H)   Vegetative buffer strips (riparian zones). For all activities
involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria
shall be met.
      (1)   A natural vegetative buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least 25 feet of the mean high water level of the channel.
      (2)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
      (3)   The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer
strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided for stream
maintenance purposes.

   Located with the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.07 of this chapter, where streams exist but where no base flood data has
been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the
following provisions apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standards
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood- proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
151.07 of this chapter.

residential structures shall:
         (a)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade; and
         (b)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely flood- proofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth, plus a minimum of one foot so
that any space below that level is water-tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §

   This chapter shall be known as the “Elizabethtown Zoning Ordinance” and may
be cited as the “zoning code”.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 1.2)
§ 154.004 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the zoning code is to implement the adopted comprehensive
plan and other plans of the city; to promote the public health, safety, morals
and general welfare; to facilitate orderly and harmonious development in the
visual and historic character of the city; to regulate the density of
population and intensity of land use in order to provide for adequate light and
air; to provide for vehicle parking and loading space; to improve the
appearance of vehicular use areas and property abutting public rights-of-way;
to require buffering between non-compatible land uses; to protect, preserve and
promote the aesthetic appeal, character and value of the city’s neighborhoods;
to promote public health and safety through the reduction of noise pollution,
air pollution, visual pollution, air temperature and artificial light glare; to
facilitate fire and police protection; to prevent the overcrowding of land,
blight and congestion in the circulation of people and commodities; to prevent
the loss of life, health or property from fire, flood or other dangers; to
protect airports, highways and other transportation facilities, public
facilities, including schools and public grounds, historic districts, the
central business district, natural resources and other areas of the city which
need special protection; to encourage the development of residential,
commercial and industrial subdivisions according to recognized standards which
provide for sound, efficient and economic development; to coordinate land
development to ensure that future growth will be orderly and conducive to the
provision of a minimum outlay of public and private expenditures in providing
services to developing areas; and to provide sound and efficient guidelines for
the overall development of the areas in which these regulations shall be
enforced. Implementation is to be by the Department of Planning and
Development, hereinafter referred to as the “Department” or its designated
agent.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 1.3)
§ 154.005 INTERPRETATION.
   The provisions herein shall be interpreted broadly and liberally so as to
implement and protect the purposes for which they are enacted. In the
interpretation and application of the zoning code, the provisions herein shall
be held to be the minimum or maximum requirements (as stated), adopted for the
promotion of the health, safety, morals, comfort prosperity and general
welfare. It is not intended by the zoning code to repeal, abdicate, annul or in
any way impair or interfere with any private restrictions placed upon property
such as covenants, deeds or recorded plats; provided, however, where this
zoning code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or
premises, or upon the height of buildings, or requires greater lot areas,
larger yards or other open spaces, than are imposed by such private
restrictions, the provisions of the zoning code shall control.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 1.4)
§ 154.006 CONFLICT OF ORDINANCE.
   Whenever the zoning code, or subdivision plats or development plans approved
in conformance with these regulations, are in conflict with applicable Kentucky
Revised Statutes, or other local ordinances, regulations or laws, the more
restrictive statute, ordinance, regulation, plat or plan shall govern and shall
be enforced by the appropriate agency. When subdivision and development plans
approved by the Commission or its appointed representative, contain setbacks or
other features in excess of the minimum zoning code requirements, such features
as shown on the approved plan shall govern and be enforced by the Department.
Private deed restrictions or private covenants for a subdivision do not fall
within the jurisdiction of enforcement by any local agency and cannot be
enforced by the city.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 1.5)
§ 154.007 PLANS AND CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS.
   (A)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in the zoning code shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
or premises on which an application for a development plan or construction
permit was filed with the Department prior to the date of adoption of the
zoning code or amendment thereto, provided that the application meets all
zoning and other requirements in effect on the date of said application. The
development plan approval or construction permit issued pursuant to
applications made before the date of adoption of the zoning code, which is 7-1-
2008, shall be valid only if it is exercised within one year of the date of the
effective date of the ordinance.
   (B)   EXERCISED, as set forth in this section, shall mean that a binding
contract for the construction of the main building or other main improvements
is executed, or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial investments
shall be under contract, in development or completed, including, but not
limited to, applications for financing, posting of a surety with the
appropriate agencies for the improvements or that the main building(s) are
under construction.
   (C)   Additional period of time to “exercise” approval may be granted under
the following conditions.

between 1-1-2006 and the effective date of the zoning code. Any construction
permit issued under this authority must be issued prior to 7-1-2012.

05-2009, passed 5-18-2009)
§ 154.008 SEPARABILITY.

person having written authorization from the owner of the subject property.
Regardless of the origin of the proposed amendment, an application must be
filed with the Department for the proposed amendment, accompanied by
information as required by KRS Chapter 100, the zoning regulations and the by-
laws of the Commission. At the time of filing an application for zoning map
amendment, a non-refundable filing fee shall be paid as set forth by city
ordinances; however, there shall be no filing fee for an amendment requested by
the City Council, Commission or any other governmental body. If the hearing
procedure is initiated by a party other than the owner, the Department shall
promptly notify the owner of the subject property as required by KRS Chapter
100.
   (B)   Pre-application conference. Prior to filing an application for a
zoning map amendment, the applicant shall meet with the Department to discuss
the proposed amendment. The purpose of this conference is to discuss, at the
earliest stages, the requirements, procedures and issues related to the
proposed amendment request. It is intended that this conference will help to
alleviate possible conflicts by early recognition of existing conditions,
necessary facilities, recommendations of the adopted comprehensive plan and
other issues related to the proposed amendment. The Department shall arrange
the conference which shall be held not less than five working days nor greater
than three months prior to the filing date. The Department shall keep a record
of the conference date and include the information in the record of the map
amendment application. The Department shall not accept an application for a map
amendment for which a pre-application conference has not been held.
   (C)   Commission procedure. Upon the filing of an application for an
amendment to the zoning map, the Department shall review the application, make
whatever studies the Commission deems necessary and report its findings at a
public hearing. In addition, the Commission may require the applicant to submit
further information subsequent to the filing of an application as provided by
KRS Chapter 100 and the by-laws of the Commission.
   (D)   Notice of public hearing. Notice of the time, place and reason for
holding a public hearing shall be given by one publication of the newspaper of
general circulation in the county, not earlier than 21 days or later than 14
days before the public hearing.
   (E)   Posting subject property. The Department shall post a sign as defined
in KRS Chapter 100 on the property of a map amendment request at least 14 days
prior to the hearing date. The sign shall be located in a conspicuous location.
   (F)   Public hearing. Upon receipt of a completed application, receipt of
the required fee, notice of map amendment on the subject property and
notification of interested parties, the Commission shall hold a public hearing
on the proposed amendment.
   (G)   Recommendation of Commission for zoning map amendment. Before making
recommendations to the City Council on a proposed map amendment, the Commission
shall make findings as required in KRS Chapter 100. The findings of fact made
by the Commission shall be recorded in the minutes and records of the
Commission. After voting to recommend that an application for an amendment to

of fact and recommendation in writing to the City Council.

§ 154.074 FDH FUTURE DEVELOPMENT HOLDING.
   (A)   In certain situations, such as proposed annexations, or areas
currently within the city limits not fully served by adequate infrastructure,
including, but not limited to, potable water, adequate fire protection, public
sanitary sewer or streets of insufficient design or construction to allow for
the safe movement of vehicular traffic, the Future Development Holding (FDH)

OVERZONES
§ 154.085 INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SERVICE BUSINESS (IHSB).
   (A)   This overzone is intended to provide additional on-premises business
identification signage which may be visible to motorists traveling Interstate
65 such that potential customers have adequate time to exit the interstate in a
safe manner. These provisions are intended for those businesses which are
located near the interstate primarily for the purpose of providing goods and
services to interstate motorists. Additionally, it is believed that in
attracting interstate motorists to goods and services near interstate highways,
there may be additional business activity generated for the remainder of
business establishments in the city.
   (B)   The Interstate Highway Service Business Overzone shall be located on

§ 154.086 FLOODPLAIN OVERZONE.
   (A)   Generally. The Floodplain (FO) Overzone is designed to protect certain
areas which have been designated as being susceptible to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
destruction or disruption of commercial and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Purpose. The designation of these areas and the regulations imposed on
this overzone are designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Provide for public awareness of the flooding potential;
      (3)   Minimize public and private property damage;
      (4)   Protect individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards;
      (5)   Minimize surface and ground water pollution and erosion of the
floodplain soils which will adversely affect human, animal or plant life;
      (6)   Minimize the expenditure of money for costly flood control
projects; and
      (7)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water,
natural gas and sanitary sewer lines, mains and facilities; electric, telephone
and cable television lines and facilities; streets and bridges; and storm sewer
facilities and structures.
   (C)   Establishment of Floodplain Overzone.
      (1)   The boundaries of the Floodplain Overzone shall be determined by
scientific and engineering studies prepared by the Federal Insurance
Administration employing customarily accepted scientific and engineering
practices of flood protection and the results thereof shall be located on the
official zoning map. The Floodplain Overzone includes all areas designated as
special flood hazard areas on the National Flood Insurance Program Flood
Boundaries and Floodway Map, City of Elizabethtown, Kentucky, dated 8-16-2007,
or an approved subsequent amendment to that map. Where interpretation is needed
in order to allow a property owner, surveyor or other individual to locate the
exact boundaries of the Floodplain Overzone as shown on the official zoning
map, the city’s Director of Storm Water Management (Floodplain Administrator)
shall initially make the interpretation based on flood profile information.
      (2)   Where Floodplain Overzone areas are designated, regulations for
these areas shall be in addition to the regular zoning district requirements.
The floodplain district shall overlay regular zoning districts. The regulations
of these areas shall be established by the flood damage prevention ordinance as
adopted by the City Council and as codified in Ch. 151 of this code of
ordinances.
   (D)   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where an
applicant wishes to establish a permitted use, he or she must conform to the
following requirements when relevant:
      (1)   All encroachment, including fill, new construction and substantial
improvements are prohibited unless permitted by the city’s Department of Storm
Water Management and other appropriate agency having jurisdiction;

and natural protective barriers;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging or other activity which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to
other lands.
   (D)   Boundaries. The boundaries of the Freeman Lake Overzone shall be
determined by scientific and engineering studies prepared by the city employing
customarily accepted scientific and engineering practices of flood protection
and climatology with the results thereof being indicated on the official zoning
map. The boundaries of the FLO for construction or use restrictions set forth
within the ordinance shall be delineated by the elevation determined by the
scientific and engineering practices for flood hazards based on the PMP. Where
interpretation is needed in order to allow a property owner, surveyor or other
individual to locate the exact boundaries of the FLO as shown on the official
zoning map, the Director of the Department and the city’s Director of Storm
Water Management (Floodplain Administrator) shall make the interpretation based
on flood profile information contained within the Hydrologic Study - PMP Flood
Limit Determinations Freeman Lake Dam Elizabethtown, Kentucky, dated July 2000,

§ 154.089 COMMERCIAL TRANSITION OVERZONE.
   (A)   Gene rally. The Commercial Transition Overzone is designed to provide
for flexibility in areas of the community determined to be in transition from
predominantly residential uses and developed commercial uses to redeveloped or
more intense commercial uses. The Commercial Transition Overzone is created to
meet the goals of the comprehensive plan, including, but not limited to,
redevelopment or reuse of declining residential and commercial areas and the
recognition that transitional areas contain land uses that are potentially more
intense and dense. Because some areas to which these goals apply are comprised
of older, smaller and narrower lots, certain waivers may be commonly required
to meet the goals of the comprehensive plan.
   (B)   Waivers. Parcels within a designated commercial transition zone may
apply for waivers from the following requirements when circumstances warrant
such waivers. These areas are:
      (1)   Minimum lot frontages;
      (2)   Parking reduction in excess of 50% of the required parking spaces;
      (3)   Parking design requirements relating to setbacks from property
lines;
      (4)   Entrance standards for distance and locations; and
      (5)   Landscaping requirements. Some landscaping must be installed as lot
and parking configurations allow.
   (C)   Process. A development plan and/or subdivision plat, as applicable,
and a waiver application must be submitted for review to the Planning
Commission for consideration of approval for all such waivers.
   (D)   Waiver limitation. Waivers are applicable to the specific development
and use requested and will not run with the land, exception being lot frontage
waivers granted for subdivisions, and are not transferable to other uses or
other lots.

§ 154.114 AMENDMENTS TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   Amendments to approved development plans can be made only by the same
procedure required for original submission. However, minor amendments which
fully meet the requirements herein may be approved and certified by the
Director of the Department without further action by the Commission.
   (A)   Minor amendments.
      (1)   Defined minor amendments are intended to expedite approval in those
situations where amendments are of minor significance and generally relate to
the shifting of previously approved spaces.
      (2)   Such amendments:
         (a)   Shall not decrease the overall land area in yards or other open
space by more than 20%;
         (b)   Shall not increase building ground coverage, floor area, or
height, or number of dwelling units by more than 10%;
         (c)   Shall not increase the number or size of signs beyond what is
allowed by the zoning regulations;
         (d)   Shall not increase the number nor change the location of street
access points, except that shifts in the approved access location, not
exceeding 25 feet may be approved as a minor amendment where the access point
is not located on an arterial street and the city departments or other agency
with jurisdiction reviewing the request determine that such relocation will not
have a negative effect on traffic safety and movement; and
         (e)   May include a reduction in floor area or number of dwelling
units that would permit a lesser number of minimum required off-street parking
spaces than required for the original development plan. To qualify as a minor
amendment, this reduction may be equal to, but may not exceed, the difference
in minimum required parking between the original plan and the proposed minor
amended plan. For any case, where parking in excess of the minimum requirement
was approved on the original development plan, the same number of spaces shall
be provided in excess of the minimum requirement for the proposed minor
amendment.
   (B)   Procedures for amendments.
      (1)   Submission. The applicant shall file the following material with
the Department: a completed application form, a filing fee, and two copies of
the plan. After Departmental review, the applicant shall then provide an
original Mylar and four copies of the plan, signed by the applicant, for
approval.
      (2)   Review. The Department shall review the plan for compliance and
shall consult with city departments and other agencies as appropriate to ensure
proper plan review. Upon determination that all requirements have been met, the
Director of the Department shall certify the plan as approved. If any questions
arise as to compliance, however, the plan shall be referred to the full
Commission for action.
      (3)   Title content and format of amendments. Amendments shall have the
same content and format requirements as the original development plan except
that:
         (a)   The plan title shall be labeled to indicate the plan as an
“Amended Development plan For...”;
         (b)   A note shall be added, listing the exact nature of the
amendments; and
         (c)   All site statistical information shall indicate existing and
proposed information.

§ 154.116 SUBSTITUTION OF SUBDIVISION PLAT FOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   In certain cases a preliminary or final subdivision plat would be more
appropriate to be considered in conjunction with a map amendment request than a
development plan. Generally, such situations involve developments where
placement of structures will be tightly controlled by the street, lot patterns
and requirements for placement of structures within the zone (typically in a
residential development); or involve development of a large tract of land. When
a developer is required to provide a development plan, and the developer
desires to file a subdivision plat in its place, the developer shall meet with
the Department in advance of filing the map amendment request to discuss the
appropriateness of a substitution. In any disputed case, the Planning
Commission shall have the final judgment as to whether a development plan or a
subdivision plat is required.

      (4)   Trim areas on exterior building materials as well as accents may
include the following:
         (a)   Smooth-faced concrete block;
         (b)   Metal panels; and
         (c)   Stucco, Dryvit.
      (5)   Prohibited exterior building materials include the following:
         (a)   PVC or similar plastic materials; and
         (b)   Pre-fabricated steel panels with a predominantly steel exterior
appearance.
   (B)   Facades and exterior walls.
      (1)   Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the
uniform, impersonal appearances of large retail buildings and provide visual
interest that will be consistent with the community’s identity, character and
scale. The intent is to encourage a more human scale.
      (2)   Developments with a facade over 100 feet in linear length which is
visible from a street shall incorporate wall projections or recesses a minimum
of three-foot depth for a minimum of 20 contiguous feet within each 100 feet of
facade length. Developments shall use animating features such as arcades,
display windows, entry areas, or awnings along at least 60% of the facade.
   (C)   Detail features.
      (1)   Buildings should have architectural features and patterns that
provide visual interest, at the scale of the pedestrian, reduce massive
aesthetic effects, and recognize local character. These elements of design
should be integral parts of the building fabric, and not superficially applied
trim or graphics, or paint.
      (2)   Building facades shall include a repeating pattern that shall
include the elements listed below. Buildings less than 15,000 square feet shall
include at least one of these elements, buildings between 15,000 square feet
and 40,000 square feet shall include at least two of these elements and
buildings greater than 40,000 square feet shall include no less than three of
the elements. At least one of these elements shall repeat horizontally. All
elements shall repeat at intervals of no more than 30 feet, either horizontally
or vertically:
         (a)   Color change;
         (b)   Texture change;
         (c)   Material change; and
         (d)    Expression of architectural or structural bay through a change
in plane no less than 12 inches in width, such as an offset, reveal, or
projecting rib.
   (D)   Ro ofs.
      (1)    Variations in roof lines should be used to add interest to, and
reduce the massive scale of large buildings. Roof features should complement
the character of adjoining neighborhoods.
      (2)   Roof lines shall be varied with a change in height every 100 linear
feet in the building length. Parapets, mansard roofs, gable roofs, hip roofs or
dormers shall be used to conceal flat roofs and roof top equipment from public
view. Alternating lengths and designs may be acceptable.
   (E)   Entryways.
      (1)   Entryway design elements and variations should give orientation and
aesthetically pleasing character to the building.
      (2)   Each principal building on a site shall have clearly defined,
highly visible customer entrances featuring the following:
         (a)   Canopies or porticos;
         (b)   Overhangs;
         (c)   Recesses/projections;
         (d)   Arcades;
         (e)   Raised corniced parapets over the door;
         (f)   Peaked roof forms;
         (g)   Arches;
         (h)   Outdoor patios;

28-2014, passed 12-15-2014)
§ 154.135 DESIGN GUIDELINES, SITE DESIGN.
   (A)   Building entrances.
      (1)   Buildings should feature multiple entrances. Multiple building
entrances reduce walking distances from cars, facilitate pedestrian and bicycle
access from public sidewalks, and provide convenience where certain entrances
offer access to individual stores, or identified departments in a large store.
Multiple entrances also mitigate the effect of the unbroken walls and neglected
areas that often characterize building facades that face bordering land uses.
      (2)   Buildings less than 40,000 square feet shall include at least one
customer entrance, buildings greater than 40,000 square feet shall include at
least one customer entrance facing any abutting street. When a customer
entrance is located at the corner of a building facing two abutting streets,
this will be construed as meeting the multiple entrances requirement. Where a
principal building directly faces more than two abutting streets, this
requirement shall apply only to two sides of the building, one of which must be
the side of the building facing the primary street. Where additional stores
will be located in the principal building, each such store shall have at least
one exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the above requirements.
   (B)   Site entrances.
      (1)   Access to the site should be clearly defined to assure that
customers can easily identify the proper traffic circulation for the
development for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It should also present a
pleasing, aesthetic entrance to the community.
      (2)   A principal entrance should be defined though the use of curbs,
appropriate traffic pavement markings, signage and extensive landscaping so
that the entrance to the development is predominant.
      (3)   Walkways should also be provided along the principal entrance with
a connection to the public sidewalk along the street.
      (4)   Walkway widths for convenience, neighborhood and community shopping
centers, restaurants and retail buildings less than 40,000 square feet should
be five feet. Walkway widths for regional shopping centers, regional enclosed
malls and retail buildings greater than 40,000 square feet should be six feet.
   (C)   Parking lot orientation.
      (1)   Parking areas should provide safe, convenient and efficient access
for vehicles and pedestrians. They should be distributed around buildings in
order to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks and to
reduce the overall scale of the paved surface. If buildings are located closer
to streets, the scale of the complex is reduced, pedestrian traffic is
encouraged, and architectural details take on added importance.
      (2)   The amount of off-street parking area for the entire property
located between the front facade within the front yard of the principal
building(s) and the primary abutting street shall be limited unless the
principal building(s) and/or parking lots are screened from view by out parcel
development and additional tree plantings and landscaping, which shall be a
minimum of 15% above the required vehicular use area (VUA) landscaping and
shall be located along the common property line of the principal building(s)
and the out parcel development.
      (3)   Principal front yard off-street parking area shall be limited to no
more than 80% of the provided parking area for convenience and neighborhood
shopping centers, restaurants and retail buildings up to 15,000 square feet; no
more than 70% for community shopping centers and retail buildings 15,000 square
feet to 40,000 square feet; and no more than 60% for regional shopping centers,
regional enclosed malls and large retail centers.
   (D)   Pedestrian walkways.
      (1)   Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented developments to the
neighborhood, thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling the development to
project a friendlier, more inviting image. Public sidewalks and internal
pedestrian circulation systems can provide user-friendly pedestrian access as
well as pedestrian safety, shelter and convenience within the development.
      (2)   Sidewalks at least five feet in width shall be provided along all
sides of the lot that abut a street, excluding interstates and limited access
state roads.
      (3)   Walkways, no less than six feet in width, shall be provided along
the full length of the building along any facade featuring a customer entrance,
and along any facade abutting off-street parking areas.
      (4)   All walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through
the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks,
or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the
attractiveness of the walkways. Signs may be installed to designate pedestrian
walkways. Connections to community features and public spaces should be
provided.
   (E)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Landscaping is a visible indicator of quality development and must
be an integral part of every commercial project and not merely located in
remnant portions of the site. Landscaping a site enhances the overall
appearance of the development, helps to protect the environment by controlling
water runoff and by reducing heat effects caused by parking areas, helps clear
the air from the effects of vehicle emissions, and can be used to clearly
define the separation between vehicle and pedestrian.
Developments should be generously landscaped to provide a pleasing environment
for the customer and the community as a whole.
      (2)   All developments shall provide a continuous landscape area along
all street frontages which shall be a minimum of ten feet in width. The use of
a variety of plant materials and elevations is encouraged in these areas
through the use of differing materials, seasonal plantings, earth berms,
decorative walls/fences and the existing topography. For regional shopping
centers, regional enclosed malls and retail buildings greater than 40,000
square feet, at least 25% of the area must be in plant materials with one tree
for every 1006 lineal feet of street frontage. For community and neighborhood
shopping centers and retail buildings 15,000 square feet to 40,000 square feet,
at least 20% of the area must be in plant materials with one tree for every 100
lineal feet of street frontage and restaurants and retail buildings less than
15,000 square feet at least 15% of the area must be in plan materials with one
tree for every 100 lineal feet of street frontage.
      (3)   Vehicular use area (VUA) landscaping shall be provided in
conformance with the standards of this section and the standards found in §§
154.150 through
154.164. VUA landscaping shall be provided in convenience, neighborhood and
community shopping centers, restaurants and retail buildings up to 40,000
square feet, at a minimum of 50% of the parking stall aisle end areas. For
regional shopping centers, malls and retail centers greater than 40,000 square
feet, the end of each parking stall aisle must be provided with VUA
landscaping. Exception: landscaping shall not be required when handicap parking
spaces are located at the end of an aisle.
      (4)   All developments shall provide a continuous landscape area along
property boundaries, except street frontages, which shall be a minimum of ten
feet in width. The use of a variety of plant materials and elevations is
encouraged in these areas through the use of differing materials, seasonal
plantings, earth berms, decorative walls/fences and the existing topography.
For community, convenience and neighborhood shopping centers and retail centers
15,000 square feet or greater, at least 20% of the area must be in plant
materials with one tree for every 40 lineal feet of boundary. If the adjoining
property is zoned residentially the continuous landscape are shall be a minimum
of 20 feet in width and a continuous planting, berm and/or decorative walls/
fences shall be provided. The berm shall be installed, no less than six feet in
height, containing at a minimum, a double row of evergreen or deciduous trees
planted at intervals of 15 feet on center. Materials, colors and designs of
screening walls and/or fences shall conform to those used as predominant
materials and colors of the building. Exception: boundaries between parcels
within the development are not required to provide continuous landscaping but
are required to provide any otherwise required VUA landscaping.
   (F)   Outdoor storage, trash collection, and loading areas.
      (1)   Loading areas and outdoor storage areas exert visual and noise
impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. These areas, when visible from adjoining
properties and/or streets, should be screened, recessed or enclosed. While
screens and recesses can effectively mitigate these impacts, the selection of
inappropriate screening materials can exacerbate the problem. Appropriate
locations for loading and outdoor storage areas include areas between
buildings, where more than one building is located on a site and such buildings
are not more than 40 feet apart, or on those sides of buildings that do not
have customer entrances.
      (2)   Areas for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection or
compaction, loading or other such uses shall not be visible from a street.
      (3)   No areas for outdoor storage, trash collection or compaction,
loading, or other such uses shall be located within 20 feet of any street,
public sidewalk or pedestrian walkway.
      (4)   Loading docks, truck parking, outdoor storage, utility meters, HVAC
equipment, trash dumpsters, trash compaction and other service functions shall
be incorporated into the overall design of the building and landscaping so that
the visual and noise impacts of these functions are fully contained and out of
view from adjacent properties and streets, and no attention is attracted to the
functions by the use of screening materials that are different from or inferior
to the principal materials of the building and landscape.
      (5)   Temporary sales/displays, such as Christmas trees, landscape
materials and fireworks, shall be permanently defined and may not occupy more
than 20% of a site. Screening with walls and/or fences may be required to
assure pedestrian and vehicular safety. Materials, colors and designs of
screening walls and/or fences shall conform to those used as predominant
materials and colors of the building.
   (G)   Features and community spaces.
      (1)   Buildings should offer attractive and inviting pedestrian scale
features, spaces and amenities. Entrances and parking lots should be configured
to be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently tied to logical
destinations. Bus stops and drop-off/pick-up points should be considered as
integral parts of the configuration. Pedestrian ways should be anchored by
special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, pedestrian light
fixtures, bollards, planter walls and other architectural elements that define
circulation ways and outdoor spaces. The features and spaces should enhance the
building and the center as integral parts of the community fabric.
      (2)   Community, neighborhood and regional shopping centers, regional
enclosed malls and retail buildings greater than 40,000 square feet shall
provide at least two of the following: patio/seating area; pedestrian plaza
with benches; transportation center; outdoor play area; kiosk area; water
feature; clock tower; steeple; or other such deliberately shaped area and/or a
focal feature or amenity. Any such areas shall have direct access to the public
sidewalk network and such features shall not be constructed of materials that
are inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape. Retail
buildings less than 40,000 square feet, convenience centers, shopping center
outparcels and restaurants are not required to provide these features and
community spaces.

§ 154.136 WAIVER PROCEDURE.
   (A)   An applicant may request a waiver from the standards as contained in
this subchapter. As part of the waiver request, the applicant shall have the
burden of proof in showing that there will be no adverse impact upon the
neighborhood or general area by the granting of the waiver.
   (B)   In granting a waiver, the Commission shall consider the following:
      (1)   The special circumstances of the proposed use;
      (2)   Site constraints that would make compliance economically
unfeasible;
      (3)   The neighborhood and the general development patterns of the
surrounding properties and the prospects for development in the near future;
      (4)   Whether the development as proposed would serve the purpose of
enhancing the public welfare and safety; and
      (5)   The guidelines listed in the specific development criteria and
targeted planning areas of the comprehensive plan.
   (C)   The Commission may also consider other factors it may deem relevant in
making its decision. A waiver of any of the requirements of this chapter does
not exempt the development from any other requirements of the chapter.
   (D)   Waivers granted shall be for the specific use. Should the use be
substantially altered (greater than a 50% change in either the building,
parking, landscaping), the developer must obtain new waivers or comply with the
sections of this chapter.

GENERAL LANDSCAPE STANDARDS
§ 154.150 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The intent of this chapter is to improve the appearance of vehicular use
areas (VUAs) and property abutting public rights-of-way; to require buffering
and screening between incompatible land uses; to protect, preserve and promote
the aesthetic appeal, character and value of the surrounding neighborhood; and
to promote public health and safety through the reduction of noise pollution,
air pollution, visual pollution, air temperature and artificial light glare.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 5.0)
§ 154.151 SITES AFFECTED.
   (A)   New sites. No new site development, building or other structure shall
hereafter be constructed or vehicular use area created or used unless
landscaping is provided as required by the provisions of the zoning
regulations.
   (B)   Existing sites. No building or vehicular use area shall be expanded,
moved or removed and/or reconstructed unless minimum landscaping requirements
of the provisions of the zoning regulations is provided for the property to the
extent of its alteration or expansion, but not for the entire property, except
as hereinafter required.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 5.1)
§ 154.152 CHANGE IN USE.
   No use shall be changed to another use for which the zoning regulations
required additional parking over and above the previously required, unless
vehicular use area landscaping is provided for the additional parking. This
shall apply regardless of whether or not new construction is necessary to meet
the parking requirements of the new uses. Where new construction will not be
necessary to meet the parking requirements, such additional required parking
shall be deemed to be on the perimeter for as much as possible of the existing
vehicular use area. Interior landscaping shall not be required where only the
use of the property is changed and no new construction or reconstruction of
buildings or installation of additional parking is proposed.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 5.2)
§ 154.153 LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   Unless otherwise provided, landscaping materials shall be installed to
provide a minimum of 50% winter opacity and 70% summer opacity between one foot
above the finished grade level to the top of the required planting, hedge,
fence, wall or earth mound within four years after installation. The required
landscaping shall be provided along the property perimeter in designated
landscape buffer areas or adjacent to the vehicular use area as required by the
zoning regulations. A planting manual and a plant materials list (Appendix A)
provides more detailed information on acceptable an unacceptable plant
material.

(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 5.8)
§ 154.159 PERIMETER LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Perimeter buffering required. Perimeter buffering shall be provided at
a minimum width as shown in §§
154.035 through
154.042,
154.055 through
154.074 and
154.085 through
154.091, Perimeter Landscape Buffer Area tables. The Commission may require
additional buffering width should it be determined that the minimums are not
adequate to buffer highly dissimilar uses. Plantings and other screening shall
be provided as shown in §§
154.035 through
154.042,
154.055 through
154.074 and
154.085 through
154.091, Perimeter Planting Density tables.
   (B)   Buffering use requirements. Perimeter buffering landscaping is
required when dissimilar uses are abutting. Buffering is based on the zoning
category in which the use would be permitted. Buffering landscaping shall be
required in conformance with the Buffering Requirements tables found in §§
154.035 through
154.042,
154.055 through
154.074 and
154.085 through
154.091.
   (C)   Landscaping in easements. The required landscape buffer area may be
combined with any easement as long as all easement requirements can be fully
met. Otherwise, the landscape buffer area shall be provided in addition to, and
separate from, any easement.
   (D)   Double frontage lots. When the rear wall of any building abuts any
collector or arterial street perimeter landscaping shall be required along the
rear lot line in conformance with the provisions of the buffering requirements
for that zone as found in the Buffering Requirements and Perimeter Planting
Density tables in §§
154.035 through
154.042,
154.055 through
154.074 and
154.085 through
154.091.
   (E)   Conflicts with utilities. When proposed perimeter screening conflicts
with utility installations, the Department may waive the requirement for the
use of plant materials only if more substantial screening such as brick, stone
or similar walls are constructed at a minimum of six feet in height. Brick or
stone columns with fencing materials between the columns may be acceptable.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 5.9; Ord. 08-2009, passed 7-6-2009)
§ 154.160 INTERIOR AND VEHICULAR USE AREA (VUA) LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Landscaping of parking area. A minimum buffer area of ten feet shall
be required along all street rights-of-way and common property boundaries. A
continuous three foot high planting, hedge shall be located within ten feet of
all parking lot pavement. A buffer area that exceeds ten feet in width shall
contain three-foot high plantings or serpentine earth mounds along 50% of the
boundary. If existing paving is less than ten feet from the property line then
additions to the parking area may be made that have the same setback as the
existing paving. The reduction in the landscape area shall be calculated and
additional landscaping equaling that amount of landscaping area shall be placed
elsewhere on site.
   (B)   Joint driveways and common vehicular use area. Vehicular use area
screening shall not be required between a vehicular use area and the adjoining
property where a property line divides a driveway used for common access to two
or more properties, or when both of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   VUAs are for the required parking for the properties or the common
use of the properties (as substantiated by reciprocal parking and access
agreements); and
      (2)   A final development plan for the properties has been approved.
   (C)   Interior landscaping for vehicular use areas. An open VUA (excluding
loading, unloading and storage areas in any regional commercial, general
commercial or industrial zone) shall provide interior landscaping in accordance
with §
154.164 Table 1. Interior landscaping shall be peninsular or island types.
Where a VUA is altered or expanded to increase the size to areas shown in §
154.164 Table 1, interior landscaping shall be provided to the extent of its
alteration or expansion. In industrial zones landscaping, including earth
berms, may be placed along the street frontage and may still be counted towards
meeting the required VUA landscaping.
   (D)   Minimum area. The minimum landscape area permitted shall be as found
in §
154.164 Table 2, with a four-foot minimum dimension to all trees from edge of
pavement where vehicles overhang.
   (E)   Maximum area. In order to encourage the required landscaped areas to
be properly dispersed, required landscaped area shall be as found in §
1
154.164 Table 2. In both cases, the least dimension of any required area shall
be a four-foot minimum distance to all trees from edge of pavement where
vehicles overhang. Landscaped areas larger than above are permitted. However,
area in excess of the maximum will not be counted towards fulfillment of VUA
landscaping requirements.
   (F)   Landscape area equivalents. Landscape areas will be calculated, for
purposes of meeting square foot requirements, as found in §
154.164 Table 7. Once area equivalents have been met, remaining areas may
consist of mulch, turf grasses or groundcovers.
   (G)   Minimum trees. Trees shall be required as shown in §
154.164 Table 7. Trees shall have a clear trunk of at least five feet above the
ground. For the purpose of this subchapter, trees are classified as shown in §
1
54.164 Tables 4 and
5. Trees of a species whose roots are known to cause damage to public roadways
or other public improvements shall not be planted closer than 15 feet to such
public improvements.
   (H)   Minimum shrubs. Shrubs shall be of a minimum size as shown in §
154.164 Table 6.
   (I)   Species mix. To encourage variation and ensure that an entire
landscape is not susceptible to blight, disease or other disaster, the number
of species required as part of the required VUA landscaping shall be as found
in §
154.164 Table 3. No individual species may exceed 50% of the required number of
trees or shrubs for the entire landscape area.
   (J)   Other materials. All plant material shall be living plants (artificial
plants are prohibited) and shall meet the following requirements.
      (1)   Vines. Vines shall be at least 12 inches high at planting and are
generally used in conjunction with walls or fences.
      (2)   Grass. Grass of the fescue, bluegrass or rye family shall be
planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns in the county and may be
sod, plugged, sprigged or seeded; except in swales or other areas subject to
erosion, here solid sod, erosion reducing net or suitable mulch shall be used.
Grass sod shall be clean and free of weeds and noxious pests or disease.
      (3)   Ground cover. Ground cover such as organic material shall be
planted not more than 15 inches on center and in such a manner as to present a
finished appearance and have 75% of complete coverage after two complete
growing seasons. In certain case, ground cover also may consist of rocks,
pebbles, sand and similar approved materials.
      (4)   Mulch. Mulch may consist of organic and/or inorganic materials such
as bark mulches, rocks, pebbles, sand or other similar materials.
   (K)   Plant quality. Plant materials in conformance with the provisions of
the zoning regulations shall conform to the standards of the American
Association of Nurserymen and shall have passed any inspection required under
state regulations. Bare root plants, with the exception of shrubs, hedges,
vines and ground cover shall be prohibited.
   (L)   Vehicular overhang. Parked vehicles may hang over the interior
landscaped area not more than two and one-half feet, as long as concrete
curbing or other wheel stops are provided to ensure no greater overhang or
penetration of landscaped area.
   (M)   Maintenance and installation. All landscaping materials shall be
installed in a sound, workmanlike manner and according to accepted, good
construction and planting procedures. The owner of the property shall be
responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all landscaping materials
and keep them in a proper, neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse and
debris at all times. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced
within one year or by the next planting season, whichever comes first, while
other defective landscape materials shall be replaced or repaired within three
months. Topping trees or the severe cutting of limbs to stubs larger than three
inches in diameter within the tree crown to such a degree as to remove the
normal canopy shall not be considered proper or permitted for the maintenance
of trees required by the zoning regulations. Violation of these installation
and maintenance provisions shall be grounds for the Department to refuse a
building occupancy permit, require a replacement of landscape materials or
institute legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of the zoning
regulations. Whenever the zoning regulations requires a continuous planting or
hedge, in addition to accepted planting procedures and size as prescribed
elsewhere in the zoning regulations, the landscape materials planted shall be
spaced a minimum of 24 inches apart at the time of planting, unless accepted
landscaping practice recommends a greater spacing requirement based on growth
rates or other conditions.
   (N)   Special provision, convenience markets, residential storage
warehouses. Convenience markets and residential storage warehouses must install
the minimum required square feet of interior landscaping. Because of the
greater number and intensity of vehicular trips, the landscaping may be placed
along the perimeter of the paved areas. All other landscaping requirements
remain in effect.

§ 154.162 PLANTING MANUAL AND PLANT MATERIALS LIST.
   Developers shall refer to the planting manual and plant materials list
(Appendix A) as a guideline for meeting the provisions of the zoning
regulations. Any materials which are not on the plant materials list shall be
considered on an individual basis to determine, based on the ability of the
unlisted plant to produce an effect similar to listed plants. A plant not on
the plant materials list shall be permitted only upon the express approval of
the Department.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 5.12)
§ 154.163 SCREENING REQUIREMENTS (SERVICE STRUCTURES, BASINS AND SATELLITE
DISHES).
   (A)   Screening required. All service structures shall be fully screened
except for those associated with one or two-family dwellings, or when located
more than 35 feet above the established grade. For the purpose of the zoning
regulations, service structures shall include propane tanks, dumpsters, air
conditioner units and condensers, electrical transformers and other equipment
or elements providing service to a building or site.
   (B)   Location of screening. A continuous fence or wall shall enclose any
service structure on all sides unless such structure must be frequently moved,
in which case, screening on all but one side is required. Exception: if the
opening of the service structure enclosure is visible from a public right-of-
way or public areas of the site, the service structure shall be screened on all
sides with a gate enclosing the opening. The average height of screening
material shall be one foot more than the height of the enclosed structure, but
shall not be required to exceed eight feet in height. Whenever a service
structure is located next to a building wall, such wall may fulfill the
screening requirements for that side of the service structure if that wall is
of an average height sufficient to meet the height requirements set out in the
zoning regulations. Whenever service structures are screened by additional
plant material, such material may count toward the fulfillment of required
interior or perimeter landscaping. No interior landscaping shall be required
within an area screened for service structures.
   (C)   Protection of screening material. Whenever screening material is
placed around any trash disposal unit or waste collection unit which is emptied
or removed mechanically on a regularly occurring basis, a fixed barrier to
contain the placement or the container shall be provided within the screening
material on those sides where there are such materials. The barrier shall be at
least 18 inches from the material and shall be of sufficient strength to
prevent possible damage to the screening when the container is moved or
emptied. The minimum front opening of the screening material shall be 12 feet
to allow service vehicle access to the containers.
   (D)   Screening of retention/detention basins. Retention/detention basins
shall be screened as follows.
      (1)   Basins with an overall average water depth of two feet or less
shall not require screening.
      (2)   Basins with an overall average water depth of more than two feet
shall be screened by a fence or railing a minimum of four feet in height where
they are within five feet of a public street or adjacent to a public sidewalk.
If the enclosure is chain link or similar fencing, landscaping shall be
installed. If the enclosure is of a decorative material, additional landscaping
will not be required.
   (E)   Screening for satellite dishes. All satellite dishes, larger than two
feet in diameter and not mounted on a building or other structure, shall be
screened so as to reduce the visual impact of the structure. This may include
shrubbery, fencing, trellis or other suitable material. The screening shall be
located on three sides while allowing enough area for the dish to rotate within
the reception range of satellites that are available at the time of
installation of the dish(es).
   (F)   Screening materials. The screening materials shall consist of the
following and are described in more detail in the planting manual and plant
materials list available at the Department.
      (1)   Walls and fences. Walls shall be constructed of natural stone,
brick or artificial material arranged in a linear, serpentine or other
alignment; fencing may include wrought iron, wood, vinyl, extruded polymer,
aluminum or similar materials. Materials other than those noted above require
Commission approval before installation. Chain link fencing may not be used to
meet the requirements of this chapter. Chain link fencing may be installed in
the required landscaped area only if it is in addition to the required
continuous planting, hedge fence wall or earth mound. All walls or fences shall
have a minimum opacity of 50%. Walls and fences allowed to meet the
requirements of this zoning chapter shall not be used for the erection or
display of any sign or other advertising device. Columns/posts may include
wrought iron, wood, vinyl, extruded polymer, aluminum, brick, natural or
cultured stone, split face masonry units or other similar materials.
      (2)   Earth mounds. Earth mounds shall be physical barriers which block
or screen the view similar to hedges, fences or walls. Mounds shall be
constructed with proper and adequate plant material to prevent erosion. A
difference in elevation between areas requiring screening does not constitute
an earth mound.

§ 154.189 WAIVER OF PARKING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Waiver of parking standards.
      (1)   A property owner may request a waiver from the off-street parking
requirements contained within the zoning regulations by filing and application
for parking waiver with the Commission. A request for a waiver may be made for
any permitted use in any zone. Waivers granted will be for the specific use
stated in the request only. Waivers will not run with the land and are not
transferable to other uses or other lots.
      (2)   A request for parking waiver shall be accompanied by a development
plan and completed application form. The application shall contain the name of
all adjoining property owners, so that notification of the waiver request may
be sent to those owners. As part of the waiver request, the applicant shall
have the burden of proof in showing that there will be no adverse impact upon
the neighborhood or general area by the granting of the waiver.
      (3)   In granting a waiver for parking, the Commission shall consider the
following:
         (a)   The special circumstance of the proposed use;
         (b)   The peak demand for parking that the proposed use would require;
         (c)   The potential for on street parking or public parking in the
general area: and
         (d)   The guidelines listed in the comprehensive plan.
      (4)   The Commission may also consider other factors it may deem relevant
in making its decision. In granting a waiver, the Commission shall not reduce
the number of parking spaces by more than 50% when 50 or fewer spaces are
required and shall not reduce the number of parking spaces by more than 30%
when 51 or more spaces are required. The Commission may not increase the number
of parking spaces by more than 50% of the required number of parking spaces as
provided by the zoning regulations. A waiver of the required number of parking
spaces does not exempt the parking area and development from any other
requirements of the zoning regulations.
   (B)   Waiver not required. A property owner does not have to request a
waiver from the off- street parking requirements when there is a reciprocal
(joint use) parking agreement on file with the Department, the properties
involved in the agreement are adjacent or are part of a shopping center or
other common development project and the properties involved in the agreement
jointly meet the minimum off-street parking requirements for all properties
involved in the agreement.

GENERAL SIGN STANDARDS
§ 154.205 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The intent of this subchapter is:
      (1)    To encourage an attractive visual environment for business and to
promote a healthy economy through informing and directing the general public;
      (2)    To protect and enhance the physical appearance of the city;
      (3)    To ensure public safety along public and private streets within
the city; and
      (4)    To provide businesses with a format for on-premises street
advertising.
   (B)   In order to establish these objectives, the city has determined:
      (1)   Without adequate regulation and design standards, signs may become
a nuisance. Signs are a nuisance when they are excessive in number and are
unduly distracting to motorists and pedestrians, creating a traffic hazard and
in some places reduce the effectiveness of other signs needed to direct and
inform the public;
      (2)   The appearance of the community is marred by the excessive number,
oversized and poorly designed signs, so that both residential and business
property values are adversely affected; and
      (3)   The number of such distracting signs ought to be reduced and signs
that are permitted should comply with the standards of this subchapter in order
to reduce the aforementioned effects; and in view of the foregoing, all signs
not in conformance with the provisions of this subchapter are hereby declared a
nuisance.

§ 154.211 TEMPORARY BANNER SIGNS.
   (A)   Temporary banners shall be allowed in all commercial, industrial and
specialized use zones. Any business shall be allowed one temporary banner, not
to exceed 50 square feet in area, to be placed on the premises. No person shall
place a banner on his or her business premises without first receiving a permit
from the Department. Permits shall be for a period not to exceed 30 consecutive
days and for a cumulative period not to exceed 120 days in any calendar year.
Immediately upon expiration of the permit, the applicable temporary banner
shall be removed. The permit for the temporary banner shall be kept on the
business premises and shall be available for inspection by the Department.
Temporary banners shall be securely installed and properly maintained the
entire time period of their display. Failure to properly maintain a temporary
banner or if the temporary banner is determined to cause a safety hazard for
pedestrians or vehicles is reason for the department to order removal of the
temporary banner or to cite the property owner.
   (B)   Special provisions. A principal structure with a minimum height of 50
feet may be allowed a temporary banner covering a maximum of 15% of the wall
area to which it is attached. The banner is restricted to a special event,
announcement, or other activity of a noncommercial nature. It cannot advertise
a product or sale to the general public. The banner can only be placed on the
principal structure. The time period for display will be determined by the
Department based on the timeliness of the message on the banner.

§ 154.212 SCENIC PARKWAY SIGNAGE.
   It is the intent of this regulation to implement the goals of the
comprehensive plan through the recognition that certain entryways/roadways to
the city are determined to be scenic in nature and therefore should be
protected from visual blight from excessive signage. To meet this community
concern, no off-premises signs shall be permitted along a designated scenic
parkway. Scenic parkways include Veterans Way, KY 3005 (Ring Road), KY 61
(Lincoln Parkway) and KY 361 (E2RC).
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 7.7; Ord. 27-2012, passed 12-3-2012)
§ 154.213 INTERSTATE OFF-PREMISES SIGNS.
   (A)   In addition to other off-premises signage allowed elsewhere in the
zoning regulations, there is to be the provision for off-premises signage along
and adjacent to Interstate 65, within 100 feet of the right-of-way and oriented
towards I 65 traffic. Signage shall be allowed in areas zoned C-3, C-4, I-1 or
I-2 as of 7-1-2008.
   (B)   Off-premises signs may be located:
      (1)   Not closer than 2,000 feet from any other such sign as measured
along the near curbside of any adjacent street in either direction from the
sign;
      (2)   Not closer than 250 feet from any other such sign as measured from
a point across the street from the sign along the opposite curbside in either
direction; and
      (3)   For signs located on lots at intersections, the measurement of
divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) above shall apply to both intersection streets,
regardless of sign face orientation.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 7.8)
§ 154.214 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   Every sign shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the
requirements of the state’s Building Code and standards and guidelines adopted
by the Department. Every sign, including those for which a permit is not
required, shall be maintained in good condition at all times. The Department
shall have the authority to order the repair, repainting, alteration or removal
of any sign which is a nuisance to the community by reason of dilapidation,
obsolescence or inadequate maintenance.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 7.9)
§ 154.215 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   The following provisions shall apply to non-conforming signs.
   (A)   Continuation, off-premises signs. With the exception of those signs
which are prohibited, a non-conforming off-premises sign may continue in
existence and shall be properly maintained in good condition but it shall not
be:
      (1)   Changed to another non-conforming sign;
      (2)   Structurally altered (except to meet safety requirements) so as to
prolong the life of the sign;
      (3)   Altered so as to increase the degree of non-conformity of the sign;
      (4)   Expanded or enlarged;
      (5)   Reestablished after its discontinuance of 90 days;
      (6)   Moved to a new location on the same building lot; or
      (7)   Reestablished after substantial damage or destruction.
   (B)   Continuation, on-premises sign. With the exception of those signs
which are prohibited, a non-conforming on-premises sign may continue in
existence and shall be properly maintained in good condition. Should a legal
non-conforming sign be replaced, the sign may not increase its degree of non-
conformity, but may decrease in degree of non-conformity.
   (C)   Continuation, status change. When a legal on-premises sign becomes an
off-premises sign due to the sale of the property on which the sign is located
it may continue to exist if all the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The sign may only advertise a single business and it shall be the
business that was formerly located on the property;
      (2)   The business to which the sign pertains is located within 750 feet
of the sign as measured along the near curbside of the adjacent street;
      (3)   The sign is less than 100 square feet in area;
      (4)   The sign is located within a commercial zoning district;
      (5)   The sign is in conformance with the spacing requirements for off-
premises signs as found in this chapter;
      (6)   The sign shall be located on the existing pole or monument; and
      (7)   The sign shall be properly maintained in good condition.

enforcement action that may be appropriate.

            2.   Permitted secondary front yard fencing and walls shall not
exceed six feet in height and shall not contain any barbed wire; and
            3.   No fencing or walls shall be allowed in the primary front yard
unless meeting the requirements for primary front yard fencing as found
elsewhere in this chapter.
      (3)   Decorative/ornamental fences. Decorative/ornamental fencing may be
placed in the primary and secondary front yards under all the following
conditions.
         (a)   Maximum height shall not exceed 42 inches, measured from the
adjacent finished grade to the top of any vertical or horizontal slat/picket or
similar member. No variance from this maximum restriction may be obtained.
         (b)   Corner posts and/or columns may have a maximum height of 48
inches, measured from the adjacent finish grade to the top of the post or
column. Lighting fixtures are exempted from this maximum height. No similar
ornamental features may exceed this height.
         (c)   Fencing material may not block access to any public sidewalk or
way.
         (d)   Fencing material may not project into any sight triangle as
defined elsewhere in this chapter.
         (e)   Decorative ornamental fencing may include wrought iron, wood,

vinyl coated chain link, rolled (welded) wire, chicken wire, warning barrier,
rabbit guard, garden netting, poultry netting or other similar materials.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 8.1; Ord. 08-2009, passed 7-6-2009)
§ 154.232 SUBDIVISION IDENTIFICATION SIGN/SIGNATURE ENTRANCE.
   (A)   Each entrance to the subdivision or section of the subdivision may
have no more than two signs per entrance.
   (B)   A subdivision identification sign/signature entrance is any wall(s),
fence(s), guard house or similar structure at an entrance to any subdivision.
      (1)   The sign/entrance shall not obstruct the natural roadside drainage
or through drainage facilities and allow for adequate sight distance. The
Engineering Department may require the location of the proposed sign/entrance
be staked in the field and approved prior to construction.
      (2)   Signs/entrances shall not be permitted within utility or drainage
easements without prior approval from the agency to which the easement has been
dedicated.
      (3)   Signs/entrances shall not be permitted within the right-of-way of
an arterial or collector street except those collector streets functioning as
the primary entrance to the proposed development and provided that approval
from the Engineering Department and any other appropriate authority is
obtained.
      (4)   Signs/entrances may be located within the right-of-way of a local
street if approved by the Engineering Department.
      (5)   Encroachment permits and proof of permanent maintenance must be
received for any sign/entrance to be located within a right-of-way prior to
permit approval.
      (6)   Prior to construction of any sign/entrance within a right-of-way,
an indemnity agreement must be provided by the developer or owner to the city.
Such agreement shall conform to the format approved by the Commission.
      (7)   Any public agency responsible for maintenance of facilities within
the right-of-way may require, for any reason, the removal of a sign/entrance
located within the right-of-way. The removal shall be done at the owner(s)
expense and within 30 days from receiving written notice.
      (8)   Length: the maximum length of a sign/signature entrance shall not
exceed 100 feet on each side of the entrance roadway. Any structure extending
beyond this length shall be considered a fence or wall and the requirements for
walls and fences shall apply.
      (9)   Proximity to structure on lot and driveways: signs/entrance shall
be constructed a minimum of 20 feet from any dwelling or driveway entrance.
      (10)   Landscaping: in order to mitigate the visual impact of sign
structures on adjacent vehicular corridors and land uses, any sign/entrance
equal to or greater than eight feet in height shall have plantings adjacent to
at least 50% of its exterior facade. Such plantings shall conform to the
standards of size, materials and quality as set forth in the landscaping
regulations of the zoning chapter.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 8.2)
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
§ 154.245 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The intent of this subchapter is to set minimum and maximum requirements for
lots, yards, heights of buildings and other structures, protect environmentally
sensitive and geologic hazard areas and to promote public health and safety
through the provision of adequate public facilities.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 9.0)
§ 154.246 MINIMUM LOT AREA.
   Except as otherwise specifically provided, no principal building shall
hereafter be erected on a lot which has less than the minimum area or width
specified for the respective zone, and no building shall hereafter be erected
or converted for dwelling use on a lot containing less than the minimum lot
area so specified. The total gross floor area in all buildings on the lot shall
be considered in determining the adequacy of lot area.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 9.1)
§ 154.247 YARDS.
   Except as otherwise specified herein, every lot shall have a front yard and
a rear yard the least depths of which shall not be less than those specified
for the respective zone and every lot shall have a side yard on each side,
which shall not be less than a side yard as specified for this respective zone.
   (A)   Front yards.
      (1)   All lots require a front yard to be provided along each street lot
line.
      (2)   Where the front wall of a building is not parallel with the front
lot line or is broken or otherwise irregular, the average depth of the front
yard shall not be less than the otherwise required front yard; provided,
however, that such front wall shall at all points be within five feet of the
otherwise required front yard depth.
      (3)   Large commercial or industrial developments consisting of a
structure containing 40,000 square feet or more, having a height of 25 feet or
more at street grade on major arterial streets may be required to provide
additional building setbacks to reduce visual impact of the large buildings on
the surrounding landscape.
   (B)   Side yards.
      (1)   In any zone where a side yard is required, the least width of each
side yard shall be increased by six inches for each foot where the side wall of
a building exceeds 50 feet in height.
      (2)   In the case of attached dwelling units, the entire structure shall
be considered as a single building with respect to side yard requirements.
      (3)   Where the side wall of a building is not parallel with the side lot
line or is broken or otherwise irregular, the average width of the side yard
shall not be less than the required side yard; provided, however, that the side
yard shall not be narrower at any point than three feet.
   (C)   Rear yards. Where the rear wall of a building is not parallel with the
rear lot line or is otherwise irregular, the average depth of the rear yard
shall not be less than the required rear yard; provided however, that the rear
yard shall not be narrower at any point than ten feet.
   (D)   Yard requirements for shopping centers and regional enclosed shopping
centers. For shopping centers and regional enclosed shopping centers which are
designed to be one continuous structure and placed on two or more lots, it
shall be permitted to place the structure on or above the side lot line of two
adjoining properties. To qualify, the structure must project onto the adjoining
lot no less than ten feet. The developer shall provide a reciprocal parking
agreement and any common area agreements along with satisfying all other
section of this chapter as required.
   (E)   Special yard requirements. It is recognized that in certain
developments, it is beneficial to create larger side and rear yard setbacks, in
order to buffer land uses of differing density and intensity, which abut along
the side and rear lot lines. In such developments, if a 75-foot or greater yard
setback is provided, development shall be permitted through the highest density
allowed in this chapter. Density determinations will be based on the lot area
less the increased yard area.
   (F)   Open space yard requirements. When a lot or parcel is subdivided for
the purpose of creating a permanent open space, or becoming a conservation
area, or nature preserve, or linear greenbelt park, then the minimum
requirements for lot criteria standards of this chapter shall not apply. The

§ 154.248 HEIGHT OF STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Maximum. Except as hereinafter provided, no building or structure, or
part thereof, shall hereafter be erected or altered to a height greater than
the maximum specified for the respective category.
   (B)   How measured.
      (1)   For the purpose of this chapter, the HEIGHT of a wall or structure
or a part of a building is the mean vertical distance from the average
established grade in front of the lot, or from the average natural grade at the
building line, if higher, to the average height of the top of the cornice of
flat roofs, or roof line, or to the deck line of a mansard roof, or to the
middle height of the highest gable or dormer in a pitched or hipped roof, or if
there are no gables or dormers, to the middle height of such pitched or hipped
roof.
      (2)   Where a lot abuts on two or more streets or alleys of different
average established grades in front of the lot, the higher of such grades shall
control only for a depth of 120 feet measured perpendicularly back from the
line of the higher street or alley.
      (3)   On a corner lot the height of the mean vertical distance from the
average natural grade at the building line, if higher, in the street of
greatest width, or if two or more such streets are of the same width, form the
highest of such grades. The height limitations as controlled by the wider
street shall govern for a distance of 120 feet measured at right angles back
from such wider street, except on parts of such 120 feet as may be within a
more restricted height.
   (C)   Exceptions of height limits.
      (1)   Notwithstanding other regulations in this chapter or the maximum
specified for the respective category, the height limits of this chapter shall
not apply for the following: barns, silos or other farm structures on farms;
church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes; monuments; water towers;
observation towers; transmission towers; windmills; chimneys; smokestacks;
derricks; conveyors; flag poles; radio towers; masts and aerials; bulkheads;
elevator penthouses; fire towers; hose towers; cooling towers; grain elevators;
and other structures, where the manufacturing process requires a greater
height; provided, however, that all such structures above the limiting heights
specified in this zoning chapter shall not be closer than 25 feet from every
lot line not a street lot line, and shall be set back one foot from the
otherwise required setback at the limiting height, for each foot of vertical
height above the limiting height; and
      (2)   Solar heating and solar collection devices, provided such devices
do not exceed by more than five feet the otherwise permitted maximum height for
the zone in which they are located.

§ 154.249 ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AND GEOLOGIC HAZARD AREAS.
   It is recognized that certain areas in the city, due to environmental or
geologic conditions, may pose problems providing safe development where such
conditions are encountered on the land to be developed. These areas are defined
and described as follows.
   (A)   Environmentally sensitive area. This term applies to any area which,
due to its natural or physical setting, may have environmental problems with
regard to their development. This is not to say that the land cannot be
developed, but if it is determined that development can occur, then some
safeguards such as detailed site planning will be necessary to overcome the
physical limitation of the land. Lands in question shall include, but not be
limited to, areas of poor soils, improper fill, wetlands, significant areas of
tree stands, aquifer recharge areas, well-head protection areas, riparian
areas, streams, creeks, lakes and other natural waterways.
   (B)   Geologic hazard areas.
      (1)   A geologic hazard area differs from an environmentally sensitive
area in that the environmental problems are so numerous that development, even
with severe limitations, would pose a severe problem to the immediate area or
the surrounding areas. Examples of these areas are areas of excessive
floodplain, areas that have clustering of sinkholes, areas of severe slope
(over 20%) and areas that have potential collapse problems due to caves
underneath the rock strata but close to the surface.
      (2)   Location of most of the environmentally sensitive and geologic
hazard areas are shown in the Hardin County Soil Survey prepared by the U.S.
Soil Conservation Service. Additional maps and other information regarding such
areas are on file with the city.
   (C)   Procedures. The developer shall submit the following materials to the
Department for any development involving an environmentally sensitive or
geologic hazard area: an application, containing a general statement of
development activity and mitigation plans; a development plan or subdivision
plat as required by the zoning regulations, which shall locate and identify
such areas. Additionally, the following materials may be required after initial
review by the Department: engineering studies of sub- surface conditions,
erosion and sedimentation control plans, drainage plans, soil analysis or
grading plans.
   (D)   Standards. Whenever a development is proposed on land containing such
areas the following requirements shall apply.
      (1)   Environmentally sensitive areas.
         (a)   All such areas shall be protected by special design measures
taken by the developer to attempt to minimize the developments impact.
         (b)   Acceptable design measures are:
            1.   Non-disturbance of area;
            2.   Provisions of additional building setbacks (at a minimum, a
50-foot setback), so that site disturbance is minimal;
            3.   Provision of easements in such areas as may be appropriate, so
that an open space area is provided;
            4.   Provision of storm water retention areas; and
            5.   Re-contouring and excavation of the area, only when an erosion
control plan is approved by the Storm Water Management Department and when
appropriate performance surety has been posted with the city.
      (2)   Geologic hazard areas. All such areas shall be protected by
generously designing the development such that a geologic hazard area shall be
left in its natural state as a permanent open space for a distance of 100 feet
from such areas.
   (E)   Commission review. After review of the applications general statement
and applicable plans, if the Department finds that questions remain concerning
the developments impact on the environmentally sensitive area or the health and
safety of future users of the area, the plan will be referred to the Commission
for action. The Commission shall refuse to fully approve a plan or plat until
it is satisfied that the hazards have been eliminated or adequate safeguards
have been provided to ensure the least negative impact on the area.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 9.4)
§ 154.250 PUBLIC FACILITIES.
   (A)   Water supply system. Every development shall be provided with a
complete water distribution system adequate to serve the proposed development,
including adequate fire protection facilities (as required by the city’s fire
protection and prevention ordinance). The entire water system shall be provided
by the developer and shall be designed and constructed to meet the approval of
the city and/or appropriate utility.
   (B)   Storm water drainage system. Provisions shall be made for satisfactory
drainage of storm water by means of underground pipes and/or surface ditches.
The storm water drainage system shall be provided by the developer and shall be
designed to standards adopted by the city and in all aspects shall meet the
approval of the city’s Storm Water Management Department.
   (C)   Sanitary sewage disposal system. Provisions shall be made for
satisfactory sanitary sewer in all developments. The developer shall provide a
complete public sanitary sewer system designed and constructed according to the
specifications of the city, unless it is determined by the Engineering
Department that sanitary sewer is not readily available. If public sanitary
sewer service is not readily available, then a private sanitary sewer (septic
system) shall be provided in conformance with the requirements of the County
Health Department and the requirements listed in this section.
   (D)   Natural gas system. Where natural gas service is desired in a
development, application must be made to the city. Gas line extension shall
conform to the policies of the Gas Department and shall be designed and
constructed according to the specifications of the city.
   (E)   Electric and telephone supply system. Provisions shall be made in
every development for satisfactory electrical and telephone supply system
approved by the appropriate utility.
   (F)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided in accordance with the
following requirements.
      (1)   Installation requirements.
         (a)   No new site development or building shall hereinafter be
constructed without the provision of a sidewalk across or adjoining the site.
These requirements shall apply to any and all residential and commercial uses,
regardless of their zoning classification.
         (b)   Excepted from this requirement is:
            1.   Suburban Residential-1 (R-1) zoned property with 200 feet or
greater street frontage;
            2.   Industrial uses; and
            3.   Single-family residential uses when more than 75% of the lots
in the applicable section of the subdivision are developed without sidewalks.
         (c)   If sufficient right-of-way or easements do not exist, an
easement shall be dedicated by the owner of record to the city for the
provision of public access for the sidewalks.
      (2)   Construction standards. Sidewalks shall be constructed to comply
with the design improvement standards for sidewalks as listed in the city’s
Subdivision Regulations Design and Improvement Standards. However, the sidewalk
width may be increased to allow for safer pedestrian access along high volume
streets or to provide for handicap accessibility, upon determination of such
need by the reviewing authority.
      (3)   Waiver of sidewalk installation.
         (a)   A property owner may request a waiver from the requirement of
sidewalk installation contained within the zoning regulations by filing an
application for sidewalk installation waiver with the Commission. A request for
a waiver may be made for any permitted use in any zone.
         (b)   If waivers have been granted previously on a parcel on the same
street within 250 feet of the site, the staff may grant the waiver
administratively. Should the waiver not be granted administratively, an
application may still be filed with the Commission as set out in section (F)(3)
(a) above.
      (4)   Waiver process.
         (a)   As part of the waiver request, the applicant shall have the
burden of proof in showing that there will be no adverse impact upon the
neighborhood or general area by the granting of the waiver.
         (b)   In granting a waiver, the Planning Commission shall consider the
following:
            1.   The desirability to preserve natural topography or vegetation
pre-existing the proposed project, provided that pedestrian traffic can be
sufficiently and safely accommodated internally on the project or on the
opposite side of the street.
            2.   Installation of the sidewalk is technically infeasible due to
site features or conditions (includes exceptional topographic conditions,
environmental or wetland impacts, or unique site conditions) as confirmed by
the City Engineer or other staff of the city or the Kentucky Transportation
Cabinet.
            3.   Extraordinary reasons which are reviewed on a case-by-case
basis. Lack of a connection to an existing sidewalk is not in and of itself
justification for a waiver.
            4.   Granting a waiver will result in the development being more in
keeping with the Comprehensive Plan and the intent of the Zoning Ordinance and
Subdivision Regulations.
            5.   The Commission may also consider other factors it may deem
relevant in making its decision.
         (c)   If a waiver request is approved, the developer must pay into a
fund dedicated exclusively to the construction of sidewalks an amount
equivalent to the estimated cost of the waived sidewalks at the unit price
established by the City Engineer. A waiver of the requirement for sidewalk
installation does not exempt the development from any other requirements of the
zoning chapter.
      (5)   Delayed sidewalk installation. If a required sidewalk is likely to
be damaged or replaced as part of a project included in the city's Capital
Improvements Plan, the developer may pay into a fund dedicated exclusively to
the construction of sidewalks an amount equivalent to the estimated cost of the
sidewalk at the unit price established by the City Engineer. The city will
install the sidewalk as part of the planned capital project.
      (6)   Exemptions.
         (a)   The following rights-of-way are exempted from the requirement of
sidewalks:
            1.   Interstate 65;
            2.   Western Kentucky Parkway;
            3.   US 31W Bypass; and
            4.   Bluegrass Parkway.
         (b)   Also exempted are frontages adjacent to the above named rights-
of-way where access control fences are present.

entrances and encroachments using the standards set forth in the comprehensive
plan, for spacing, location and safe traffic movement.
      (3)   Entrances shall be from the street having the lower classification
and/or average daily traffic (ADT). In the event that both streets are of the
same classification, the entrance shall be located on the street with the lower
ADT.
      (4)   Through the encroachment permitting process entrances with a
greater width than listed above shall be submitted to the Engineering
Department for review and may be approved when extenuating circumstances exist.
   (B)   Entrance distance from street intersections.
      (1)   Residential entrances. The minimum distance from the intersection
of two or more streets to an entrance shall be 50 feet on local streets and 100
feet on collector streets, measured from the nearest edge of the pavement/curb
line. Entrances with spacing less than these minimums shall be submitted to the
Engineering Department for review and may be approved when extenuating
circumstances exist.
      (2)   Multi-family, commercial and industrial entrances. The minimum
distance from the intersection of two or more streets to an entrance shall be
150 feet, measured from the nearest curb lines. Entrances with spacing less

§ 154.253 RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTH.
   Developments shall dedicate additional right-of-way necessary to meet the
minimum width requirements specified in the Subdivision Regulations. Additional
right-of-way may be required as necessary to accommodate necessary future
improvements within the right-of-way. This requirement may be reduced or waived
by the City Engineer and the Director of Planning and Development if the
existing right-of-way is found to be sufficient to accommodate all necessary
public improvements, or if the possibility exists to obtain additional right-
of-way on the opposite side of the right-of-way.

§ 154.254 CONNECTIVITY STANDARDS.
   (A)   Existing stub streets or rights-of-way shall be extended through the
development site to adjacent vacant properties or streets.
      (1)   This requirement may be waived by the City Engineer and the
Director of Planning and Development if the extension is infeasible due to
physical constraints or if the extension would create an inappropriate
connection between incompatible uses.
      (2)   If the extension is waived by the City Engineer and the Director of
Planning and Development, the street shall be terminated in an appropriate
manner to adequately serve all lots.
   (B)   Residential developments adjacent to vacant parcels shall provide
street connections that stub into the vacant parcels to provide future
connections.
      (1)   This requirement may be waived by the City Engineer and the
Director of Planning and Development if the extension is infeasible due to
physical constraints.
   (C)   Commercial developments shall provide for vehicular and pedestrian
connections to adjacent commercial developments. If the adjacent property is
already developed, the proposed development shall provide for the future
connection through easements or other appropriate measures.
   (D)   Industrial zoned properties shall not be required to provide
connections to adjacent properties.
   (E)   Waiver procedure. If these standards are not waived by the City
Engineer and the Director of Planning and Development, an applicant may request
a waiver from the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall consider
the following:
      (1)   The special circumstances of the proposed use.
      (2)   Whether the waiver will have an adverse impact on the public
health, safety and welfare.
      (3)   Whether site constraints make the improvements economically
unfeasible.

conformity shall not be increased. The zoning regulations shall not be
construed to prevent the strengthening, repairing or restoring to a safe
condition of any structure or parts thereof.
   (B)   Should a non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of a
structure be demolished by any means, it shall not be reconstructed except in a
manner to make it a conforming structure under the zoning regulations.
   (C)   A structure may be altered to decrease its non-conformity.
   (D)   Should a non-conforming structure be moved for any reason, for any
distance, it shall thereafter conform to the zoning regulations.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 11.3; Ord. 09-2020, passed 8-3-2020)
§ 154.289 REGULATION OF NON-CONFORMING LOTS.
   A non-conforming lot shall be permitted to continue and shall be regulated
as follows.
   (A)   (1)   A non-conforming lot shall not be further subdivided or
consolidated, in whole or in part, with another parcel, in a manner which
increases its non-conformity. It may, however, be altered so as to decrease its
non-conformity.
      (2)   However, the Commission may approve the subdivision of a lot which
has two or more legally constructed principal structures into separate parcels
for the purpose of the sale or transfer of the individual structures, if the
Commission finds that the properties have been used in a separate and distinct
manner with separate utilities and other facilities so that the resulting re-
subdivision will not constitute a material change in use of the property.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any portion of the zoning regulations, a non-
conforming lot may be used for construction of any otherwise lawfully permitted
structure in a zone in which the lot is located. Such a non-conforming lot must
be in separate ownership and not in contiguous frontage with other lots in the
same ownership.
   (C)   If two or more lots with continuous frontage are in single ownership,
and if any of the lots have less than 50 feet of street frontage, the land
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel. No subdivision or
consolidation in whole or in part with another lot shall be made of such
parcels which reduce the parcel below the requirement for a permitted lot in a
zone in which the parcel is located. However, the Commission may permit the
sale or transfer of lots where each has a legally constructed principal
structure.

§ 154.290 CONDITIONAL USES ARE NOT NON-CONFORMING USES.
   Any existing principal use at the date of the adoption or amendment of the
chapter which would thereafter require a conditional use permit shall be deemed
a conforming use, but any enlargement or replacement of such use shall require
a conditional use permit as provided by the zoning regulations.
(Ord. 06-2008, passed 6-16-2008, § 11.5)

§ 155.01 INTRODUCTION; PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property
and prevent damage to the environment in the city. This chapter will also
promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design,
construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity that
disturbs the soil or results in the movement of earth within the city.
   (B)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Left unchecked, eroded soil migrates through the entire
storm water system and necessitates the early maintenance and/or repair of
inlet boxes, storm sewers, ditches, creeks and other storm water features.
Streets with sediment deposits are slick and hazardous to the motoring public.
Clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation
necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
   (C)   Through the Clean Water Act (CWA), the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the Kentucky Division of Water (KYDOW) established
Phase II regulations and mandated Erosion Protection and Sediment Control
(EPSC) procedures for construction within the commonwealth.

§ 156.06 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND GENERAL APPROACH.
   (A)   Program objectives.
      (1)   Protection of the short-term and long-term public health, safety
and general welfare. This objective will be achieved by the following:
         (a)   Providing for regulation and management of the city’s storm
water system, including public and private facilities in the city’s service
area;
         (b)   Protecting, and preserving storm water quality and thereby fish
and wildlife habitat within the city and in downstream receiving waters; and
         (c)   Protecting those downstream and adjacent properties from storm
water quality impairment.
      (2)   Compliance with state and federal storm water regulations developed
pursuant to the Clean Water Act amendments of 1987 and subsequent amendments.
This objective will be achieved by the following:
         (a)   Benefitting storm water quality to a level of “designated use”,
as defined by the Clean Water Act §§ 305(b), being 33 U.S.C. § 1315(b), and 303
(d), being 33 U.S.C. § 1313(d), and minimizing the impacts from new development
and/or areas of significant redevelopment;
         (b)   Managing the quality of storm water discharged to the MS4 by
controlling the contribution of pollutants associated with new development and
redevelopment;
         (c)   Minimizing damage to public facilities and utilities;
         (d)   Managing the use of the public and private storm water/drainage
system that will not result in excessive maintenance costs;
         (e)   Encouraging the use of natural and aesthetically-pleasing
designs that maximize the preservation of natural areas;
         (f)   Guiding the construction of storm water management facilities by
developing comprehensive master plans that address storm water quantity,
quality, design, operation and maintenance;

(Ord. 07-2012, passed 4-2-2012)
§ 156.08 POST-CONSTRUCTION STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Storm water quality management. The permittee shall complete a permit
application that includes a post-construction storm water pollution prevention
plan (P-SWPPP) to be completed, sealed and signed by a licensed professional
engineer and submitted to the city representative.
   (B)   Post-construction storm water pollution prevention plan. The P-SWPPP
shall include the following information:
      (1)   A description of the proposed land use including amount of
impervious area, directly connected impervious area and nature of the
development;
      (2)   Location, dimensions, detailed specifications and construction
details of all post- construction storm water quality best management practices
(BMPs), as defined in the city guidance documents;
      (3)   A sequence describing when each post-construction storm water
quality BMP will be installed;
      (4)   A long-term operation and maintenance agreement containing
maintenance guidelines for all post-construction storm water quality measures
to facilitate their proper long-term function. This agreement shall be made
available to future parties, including property owners, who will assume
responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the post-construction storm
water quality measures;
      (5)   The P-SWPPP shall include provisions for waterway buffers:
         (a)   The waterway buffer will be used to define areas where land
disturbance activities shall be permitted, but construction of any building or
structure shall not be permitted;
         (b)   A waterway buffer shall be applied to all waterways serving more
than 25 acres of tributary area or presented on a United States Geological
Survey map as a blue line stream;
         (c)   The waterway buffer shall be defined as the greater of:
            1.   Area contained within a boundary established by the floodplain
boundary as defined by FEMA or city master planning: or
            2.   The buffer will be 25-feet on each side from the top of
waterway bank as defined by geomorphic shape (not by the current water surface
elevation).
         (d)   The waterway buffer and floodplain may be used for application
of storm water quality devices. This may only be permitted if erosion
prevention and sediment control, water quality and floodplain cut fill policies
are adequately addressed as determined by the city;
         (e)   Exemptions may be granted at the discretion of the city for:
            1.   Roads and utilities crossing waterways;
            2.   Pedestrian trails and walkways proximate to waterways; and
            3.   Other exemptions.
      (6)   A licensed professional engineer in the commonwealth shall stamp
all construction plans and long-term maintenance documentation. This shall
include all proposed improvements or modifications to existing or new storm-
water infrastructure and other related improvements or modifications; and
      (7)   The city may require the posting of a maintenance bond to secure
the structural integrity of said facilities as well as the functioning of said
facilities in accordance with the approved post-construction SWPPP for a term
of 24 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. An irrevocable letter
of credit can be used as the financial assurance in lieu of a maintenance bond
although the contribution shall be equivalent to the amount that would be
estimated for the maintenance bond. The maintenance bond shall be calculated as
20% of the estimated construction cost and may be reduced to 10% after 12
months if there are no concerns by the city representative.
   (C)   BMP design requirements and criteria.
      (1)   The city reserves the right to develop or adopt other guidance
documents to serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance
documents distributed by the city should be reviewed and considered when
preparing the post-construction SWPPP. These documents may be applied as
standards by which designs are to be prepared and controls implemented.
      (2)   The city shall have authority to implement this chapter by
appropriate regulations, guidance or other related materials. In this regard,
technical, administrative or procedural matters may be modified as needed to
meet the objectives defined herein, so long as such modifications as to
technical, administrative or procedural matters are not contrary or beyond the
intent of the objectives defined above.
         (a)   Regulations, guidance or other related materials that may be
given authority by this chapter may include, but are not limited to: best
management practice (BMP) manuals, design regulations and requirements,
submittal checklists, review checklists, inspection checklists, certifications,
storm water management manuals, in lieu fee schedule, and operation and
maintenance manuals.
         (b)   Materials may include information deemed appropriate by the city
including and specifications for the preparation of grading plans, guidance
selecting environmentally sound practices for managing storm water, minimum
specifications and requirements, more complete definitions and performance
standards.
         (c)   The above referenced documents may restrict or prevent the use
of specific products, techniques or management practices (that are to be
accepted by the public or are deemed to have a negative impact on public
infrastructure or the MS4) that have been identified as unacceptable for
performance, maintenance or other technically based reasons.
         (d)   Documents referenced above may be updated periodically to
reflect the most current and effective practices and shall be made available to
the public. However, the failure to update the manual shall not relieve any
applicant from the obligation to comply with this chapter, and shall not
prevent the city from imposing the most current and effective practices.
      (3)   The P-SWPPP shall include provisions for storm water quality BMPs
functioning independently or in combination. Acceptable storm water quality
BMPs shall be defined by policy and guidance documents as approved by the city.
      (4)   The P-SWPPP shall include provisions for storm water quality BMPs
that are designed to achieve the following design/performance objectives:
         (a)   Development shall be designed with management measures that are
built and maintained to treat, filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen, evapo-
transpire, harvest and reuse storm water runoff, or otherwise manage the storm
water quality produced from an eightieth percentile precipitation event (0.75-
inch rainfall). At least 80% of the average annual post-construction total
suspended solids (TSS) load shall be removed.
         (b)   Reduce or buffer increases in storm water runoff temperature
caused by contact with impervious surfaces.
         (c)   Reduce or buffer increases in storm water runoff volume and flow
rate caused by increases in impervious area.
         (d)   Storm water detention/retention facilities shall be designed to
address the rate at which flow is released over the entire runoff discharge
period and the volume of discharge over the critical design-storm period as
defined by city storm water master plans. The outlet structure shall be
designed as a v-notch weir or other multiple stage configurations capable of
controlling (limiting) the discharge rates for the two-, ten-, 25- and 100-
year, 24-hour, SCS Type II distribution, design storm events to pre-developed
levels for all new developments. The approved P-SWPPP may require the first
flush (0.75-inch rainfall) to be retained in the basin without discharge.
Redevelopment shall reduce the discharge from their site to meet this same
standard. This may require the redesign and reconstruction of existing basins
at the site to meet the current standard.
         (e)   Culvert and storm sewer improvements shall be designed to
minimize scour. The FHWA HDS No. 5 design methodology (latest edition)
considering inlet and outlet control shall be used. For major culverts and
storm sewers, as designated by the city, a 100-year, SCS Type II, 24-hour
design flow shall be used with a HW/d less than or equal to one. For minor,
subdivision level culverts and storm sewers, a 25-year SCS Type II 24-hour
storm and a HW/d less than or equal to one shall be used. In this instance, a
check of the 100-year SCS Type II 24-hour flow with a HW/d less than or equal
to 1.2 shall also be performed. Pipe outlets shall be protected with channel
lining or permanent turf reinforcement mat, as supported by sound civil
engineering design.
         (f)   Storm water hotspots are areas that often produce higher
concentration of certain pollutants, such as hydrocarbons or heavy metals, than
are normally found in urban runoff. These sites shall be required to provide
effective removal of the particular pollutant(s) which they discharge.
Effective removal shall be deemed as that which existed prior to development of
the site or in the case of redevelopment that which existed prior to any
development to the site. Review and approval is required prior to commencement
of construction.
            1.   Examples of storm water hotspots include:
               a.   Gas/fueling stations;
               b.   Restaurants;
               c.   Vehicle repair facilities;
               d.   Vehicle washing/steam cleaning facilities (including mobile
operations);
               e.   Auto and metal recycling facilities;
               f.   Outdoor material storage areas;
               g.   Loading and transfer areas;
               h.   Landfills;
               i.   Industrial sites; and
               j.   Industrial rooftops.
            2.   Storm water hotspots shall have treatment on site and cannot
rely on regional solutions offered by the city or the larger development to
meet their individual treatment requirement.
         (g)   Soil bioengineering, “green” and other “soft” slope and stream
bank stabilization methods shall receive preference over rip rap, concrete and
other hard armoring techniques, except where necessitated by sound civil
engineering design.
         (h)   Retention-supportive data must be submitted to justify the type
of facility selected. If the facility is designed to retain (volume control)
all or a significant portion of runoff (as opposed to temporarily detain), then
appropriate soils analyses findings shall be submitted to the city. This
submission shall also discuss the impacts the facility will have on karst
topography if found through inspection or a geotechnical investigation of the
site. The facility may be designed to infiltrate runoff to groundwater rather
than transmit it downstream under conditions up to a 100-year storm event.
Injection wells shall not generally be permitted due to the relationship
between subterranean and surface flows.
         (i)   Each P-SWPPP shall be evaluated for consistency with the storm
water master plan or watershed study for the major watershed or watersheds
within which the project site is located. The individual project evaluation
will determine if storm water quantity and quality management practices can
adequately serve the property and limit impacts to downstream public and
private properties. The presence of a regional facility(s) will be considered
in determining the extent to which storm water quantity and/or quality controls
will be necessary.
         (j)   The city reserves the right to require superseding or additional
treatment criteria or objectives for specific pollutant(s) as necessary to meet
overall storm water quality management program objectives or directives under a
watershed improvement or total maximum daily load (TDML) program as
administered by the USEPA or commonwealth.
         (k)   On-site BMP coordination with regional BMPs:
            1.   All properties are expected to implement on-site storm water
quality control measures, but the extent of application may be reduced given
the availability, proximity and nature of regional storm water quality BMPs;
and
            2.   The extent and type of on-site storm water quality management
practices implemented shall be proportionate to the land use and proximity to
regional storm water quality management practices.
   (D)   BMP ownership and easement.
      (1)   Any storm water management facility or BMP which services
individual property owners shall be privately owned. General routine
maintenance (controlling vegetative growth, seeding, regrading and removing
debris) shall be provided by the owner(s).The owner shall establish a public
utilities and drainage easement over the locality for access for inspection and
emergency maintenance by the city. The city, or its designee, has the right,
but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency repairs.
      (2)   Any storm water management facility or BMP which services an
individual residential subdivision in which the facility or BMP is within
designated open areas or serves as an amenity with an established homeowners
association shall be privately owned and maintained consistent with provisions
of this chapter. The owner shall maintain a public utilities and drainage
easement which allows access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the
city. The city, or its designee, has the right, but not the duty, to enter
premises for emergency repairs.
      (3)   Any storm water management facility or BMP which services
commercial and industrial development shall be privately owned and maintained.
The owner shall maintain a public utilities and drainage easement which allows
access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city. The city, or its
designee, has the right, but not the duty, to enter premises for emergency
repairs.
      (4)   All regional storm water management control facilities proposed by
the owners, if approved and accepted by the city for dedication as a public
regional facility, shall be publicly owned and/or maintained. All other storm
water management control facilities and BMPs shall be privately owned and/or
maintained unless accepted for maintenance by the city.
      (5)   The city may require public dedication of privately-owned storm
water facilities which discharge to the city storm water system. This shall be
at the approval of the City Council.
   (E)   Regional facilities management.
      (1)   The objective of a regional storm water management facility, pond,
lake or other device, is to address the storm water management concerns in a
given watershed with greater economy and efficiency than possible through
individual facilities. The intended result is fewer storm water management
facilities to maintain in the affected watershed while sustaining efficiency.
      (2)   The city encourages regional storm water quantity and/or quality
management practices, which may be consistently and efficiently managed and
maintained. These types of practices will be encouraged in order to replace or
reduce the implementation of on-site storm water quantity and/or quality
management practices, as determined to be appropriate by the city.
      (3)   Where a regional storm water management facility has been
established by the city, or by an authority operating on behalf of the city, a
development or subdivision, unless excepted by the city, may participate in
said regional program in lieu of constructing site runoff control required by
this chapter. This may be permitted; provided that:
         (a)   Runoff from the development or subdivision is benefited by an
approved existing or proposed public regional storm water management facility
that is currently operational or will be operational within one year;
         (b)   Participation in the form of contribution of funds, contribution
of land, contribution of storm water management facility construction work, or
a combination of these, the total value of which shall be in accordance with a
fee schedule adopted by the city;
         (c)   The city finds that the storm water quality management plans are
in compliance with all other applicable requirements and ordinances;
         (d)   Fiscal or other contribution shall be used for acquisition,
design, construction or maintenance of one or more regional storm water
management facilities with the Valley Creek Watershed; and
         (e)   Detention facilities may, and are encouraged to, be designed to
serve multiple purposes. For example, runoff may be detained under wet-weather
conditions, but also serve as common or recreational areas during dry weather
conditions. Where multi-purpose facilities are provided, or where flat grades
or poorly draining soils are encountered, provisions for adequate low-flow
storm water management system may be required. Where the retention/detention
facility is planned to be used as a lake, pond or storm water quality
management practice with a permanent pool, calculations shall be performed and
submitted to demonstrate that an adequate permanent pool depth is expected
during dry summer months without vegetative growth issues.
   (F)   Long-term operation and maintenance agreements.
      (1)   General. Long-term operation and maintenance agreements shall
include a maintenance plan for all storm water quality BMPs in new development
or redevelopment that require more than general maintenance (e.g., periodic
mowing).
         (a)   The plan will be developed to ensure that the storm water
quality BMP(s) is (are) kept functional. The maintenance agreement will specify
minimum operation and maintenance requirements and intervals to be performed by
the property owner.
         (b)   The plan shall address schedules for inspections and techniques
for operation and maintenance, including vegetation clearing or mowing and
removing accumulated trash, debris, sediment pollutants and other forms of
pollution.
         (c)   The agreement shall be noted on the final plat with the
appropriate notation on the particular lot(s).
         (d)   The agreement shall be included with property ownership title
documents and shall be binding on the owner, its administrators, executors,
assigns, heirs and any other successors in interest.
         (e)   The format for the long-term operational and maintenance
agreement shall be provided through example by the city, or through guidance
documents.
         (f)   Care must be taken to ensure that any required facilities do not
become nuisances or health hazards. Detention and retention facilities should
be designed to require minimal maintenance, and maintenance expectations must
be clearly stated in the long-term operation and maintenance agreement.
         (g)   When a storm water quality BMP serves more than one parcel, a
binding contract for the purpose of operation and maintenance is required. A
property or home owners association shall be responsible for operation and
maintenance of the BMP(s) as directed by this chapter.
      (2)   Single entity ownership. Where the permanent storm runoff control
facilities are designed to manage runoff from property in a single entity
ownership, the maintenance responsibility for the storm water control
facilities shall be with the single entity owner.
         (a)   A single entity shall be defined as an association, public or
private corporation, partnership firm, trust, estate or any other legal entity
allowed to own real estate exclusive of an individual lot owner.
         (b)   The stated responsibilities of the entity shall be documented in
the long-term operation and maintenance agreement. Terms including owning,
operating and maintaining the facilities shall be submitted with plans in
application for a SWQMP Permit for an adequacy determination. Approval of a
SWQMP shall be conditioned upon the approval of these terms. These terms shall
be in writing, shall be in recordable form, and shall, in addition to any other
terms deemed necessary by the city, contain a provision permitting inspection
at any reasonable time by the city of all facilities deemed critical in the
public welfare.
         (c)   Upon approval of the storm water quality BMPs by the city, the
facility owner(s) shall demonstrate the ability to guarantee and apply the
financial resources necessary for long-term maintenance requirements. The
funding mechanism shall be in a form approved by the city. The city will only
approve funding mechanism(s) for long-term maintenance responsibilities that
can be demonstrated to be permanent or transferable to another entity with
equivalent longevity.
         (d)   In the event that proposed funding is through an owners
association, then it must be demonstrated that the association may not dissolve
unless long-term operation and maintenance activities are accepted by another
entity with equivalent longevity and adequate funding. Furthermore, the owners
association’s responsibility must be stated in the association’s declaration,
covenants or by-laws, as appropriate.
         (e)   Unless made specifically clear in the preliminary stages of the
site design and construction plan review procedure, it will be assumed that all
storm water detention, retention, treatment or storage facilities and/or
devices shall be owned, operated and maintained by a single entity, as defined
above.
      (3)   City ownership. Where the city has accepted an offer of public
dedication of the permanent storm water quality BMPs, the city shall be
responsible for operation and maintenance.
   (G)   Special watersheds.
      (1)   Special watersheds may be designated by the city with unique goals
and requirements. The minimum measures outlined in this chapter shall be met at
all times. Additional requirements, unique to the specific watershed, shall be
required to meet the specific needs of the watershed.
      (2)   Special watersheds designated:
         (a)   Hawkins Drive; flow quantity limitation. The post-developed flow
rate and quantity from the development cannot exceed the pre-developed flow
rate and quantity in this unique watershed. The karst feature that receives the
flow from this watershed has no predictable capacity. Therefore site storage,
reuse and other innovative methods to abate both rate and volume increases due
to development shall be required; and
         (b)   Current and future listings by KDOW.

performed at storm water quality BMPs on at least an annual basis and as
otherwise determined in the long-term operation and maintenance agreement.
   (B)   Oversight inspections.
      (1)   The city, or the city’s designated representative, has the

public records.
      (3)   The city shall identify in writing any measures with deficiencies
or that are not in compliance with the objectives of this chapter and the SWQMP

information of all detention, retention and water quality practices shall be
certified by a professional engineer licensed in the commonwealth. This
information shall be provided to the city, in the form of an as-built drawing
or other electronic form accepted by the city. The as-built certification shall
indicate if final conditions are consistent with, or exceed, the goals of the
storm water plan.
   (B)   If it is determined that information provided in the as-built drawing,
certification, inspection or survey of the site does not meet or exceed the
SWQMP provisions, the city reserves the right to withhold certification of
occupancy or final bond release. Furthermore, other enforcement mechanisms may
be applied to the permittee or persons making certifying statements.

citing officer may, at his or her discretion, cite the offender to appear
before the Code Enforcement Board. The city may also obtain injunctions or
abatement orders to ensure compliance with this chapter. Nothing in this
section shall negate the ability of the city to pursue applicable civil or
criminal penalties as prescribed by law. In addition to any other penalty
authorized by this section, any person, partnership, or corporation convicted
of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be required to bear
the expense of such restoration.
