as the case may be.

arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment

(KRS 61.874(2)(b))
   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure
of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if

public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which
copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may
require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose
for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a
contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records
for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on
the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff
required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the
public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public
records.
(KRS 61.874 (4))
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:
      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a
certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to subsection (G) of this section; or
      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use
of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical,
radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose merely because of its
publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.
(KRS 61.874 (5))
   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided under
this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of the
public agency. If a party wishes to access public records by electronic means
and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may
require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with
the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost
of computer time access charges;
      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a reasonable
fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).

§ 34.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN. 
   If the City Clerk/Treasurer does not have custody or control of the public
record or records requested, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall so notify the
applicant and shall furnish the name and location of the custodian of the
public record.
(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 34.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.
   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and
shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records,
not to exceed five (5) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is
given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records. However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five (5) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the
request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five (5) day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or
in part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under the official custodian's authority and shall
constitute final agency action.
(KRS 61.880)
   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.
   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General
reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part,
the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal
proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the
circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or
if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney
General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in
circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.
(KRS 61.880, 61.882)
§ 34.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.
   No official or employee of the city shall willfully conceal or destroy any
record with the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these rules
and regulations.

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication. Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under

in this subchapter, "ABANDONED URBAN PROPERTY" means:
      (1)   Any vacant structure or vacant or unimproved lot or parcel of
ground in the City which has been vacant or unimproved for a period of at least
one year and which:
         (a)   Because it is dilapidated, unsanitary, unsafe, vermin infested,
or otherwise dangerous to the safety of persons, it is unfit for its intended
use;
         (b)   By reason of neglect or lack of maintenance has become a place
for the accumulation of trash and debris, or has become infested with rodents
or other vermin;
         (c)   Has been tax delinquent for a period of at least three years; or
      (2)   Any property in the city that has been identified as "blighted" or
"deteriorated" by the Elsmere Code Enforcement Board.
   (B)   Rate of taxation for abandoned urban properties. The tax rate of
taxation levied upon abandoned urban properties is $0.75 on each $100 of
assessed value.
   (C)   Classification of property as abandoned urban property.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall each year determine which properties
in the city are abandoned urban properties and shall prepare and furnish a list
of abandoned urban properties located in the city to the city Clerk/Treasurer
and the Kenton County Property Valuation Administrator prior to January 1 of
each year.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in division (D) of this section, a
property classified by the Zoning Administrator as abandoned property as of
January 1 shall be taxed as abandoned urban property for such tax year. If the
owner repairs, rehabilitates, or otherwise returns the property to productive
use so that the property is no longer abandoned urban property, he shall notify
the city, which shall, if it finds the property is no longer abandoned urban
property, notify the Clerk/Treasurer and the Kenton County Property Valuation
Administrator to strike the property from the list of abandoned urban
properties as of the succeeding January 1.
   (D)   Right to appeal. No later than March 1 of each year, the City Zoning
Administrator shall mail, by first-class mail, to the owner(s) of each
abandoned urban property, as those name(s) are listed in the records of the
Property Valuation Administrator, a notice that this property has been
classified as abandoned urban property. The owner of any abandoned urban
property who believes that his, her, or its property has been incorrectly
classified may appeal such classification to the Elsmere Code Enforcement
Board. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be made no later than April 1
of that year. The Board shall afford the owner the opportunity for a hearing.
If the Board finds that the property was incorrectly classified as abandoned
urban property, it shall cause the property to be removed from the list of
properties so classified. The Board shall develop policies and procedures for
conducting such appeals.

§ 37.08 ELSMERE STREET TAX.
   (A)   In order that the city may provide funding for a project, described
and identified as the maintenance, repair, improvement, overlay, building,
reconstruction and replacement of public streets and roads in the city that
have been accepted by the city for maintenance, including the widening thereof
and the repair, maintenance, improvement, and addition of curbs, sidewalks,
gutters, pipes and catch basins, commencing in the fiscal year 2007-2008 and
continuing during each fiscal year thereafter, there is hereby levied a special
ad valorem tax annually at the rate of $.132 on each $100 of assessed valuation
on all taxable property within the city, which tax is deemed and found by the
City Council to be sufficient to defray the cost of the project. The tax for
the year 2008 shall be based upon the assessed valuation of all taxable
property within the city as of January 1, 2008, and in all succeeding years the
tax shall be based upon the assessed valuation of all taxable property within
the city as of January 1 of that year.
   (B)   The tax revenues generated by the special ad valorem tax shall be in
addition to other taxes imposed by the city, and shall be used solely for the
project. The special ad valorem tax shall be due at the same time and be
collected in the same manner, from time to time in effect, as are other ad
valorem taxes levied by the city. Taxes not paid shall be subject to the same
interest, penalty and cost of collection expenses, from time to time in effect,
as are other ad valorem taxes levied by the city.
   (C)   There is hereby created a separate fund to be known as the Street Fund
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Fund), into which shall be
transferred and set aside the proceeds of the special ad valorem tax. All
proceeds of the Fund shall be kept apart from other funds of the city, and
shall be accounted for separately. The proceeds in the Fund shall be invested
in accordance with applicable law, and all income derived therefrom shall be
carried to the credit of the Fund and shall become a part of the proceeds of
the Fund. The proceeds constituting the Fund shall not be disbursed, expended,
pledged, encumbered or transferred for any use or purpose other than provided
by this section. Any proceeds remaining in the Fund at the end of any fiscal
year shall remain in the Fund and be carried over to the succeeding fiscal year
for use as provided by this section.
   (D)   To the extent permitted under and in accordance with the Constitution
of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and other applicable laws and regulations,
proceeds anticipated to be derived, and the proceeds held in the Fund so
derived, from the special ad valorem tax levied hereunder may be pledged,
encumbered and/or expended to pay the principal and interest on any
indebtedness incurred, including bonds issued, by the city to carry out and
perform the project.
   (E)   In any fiscal year in which the City Council determines that the full
amount of the special ad valorem tax levied hereunder is not necessary to fund
the project, the city may by ordinance in any fiscal year reduce the rate of
the special ad valorem for such year below the amount set forth herein. In any
fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the special ad valorem tax rate
may have been reduced by ordinance, the special ad valorem tax rate shall
revert to the maximum amount as set forth in this section unless reduced for
such subsequent year by ordinance.

determine whether the impoundment was valid and reasonable. Where it has not
been established that the impoundment was justified, an order releasing the
vehicle shall be entered. Where it has been , established that the impoundment

(Ord. 1242-1985, passed 4-9-85)
§ 92.16 SMOKE DETECTORS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Subject to such exceptions and conditions for compliance as stated in
this subchapter, smoke detectors shall be required in all dwellings privately
owned or rented for occupancy. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of
each new or existing occupied dwelling unit to install smoke detectors in each
dwelling unit as hereinafter provided. The smoke detectors shall be capable of
sensing visible or invisible particles of combustion and providing a suitable
audible (or visual for the deaf or hearing impaired) alarm.
   (B)   This subchapter shall apply to any and all dwellings or dwelling
units, new or existing, which do not fall under the jurisdiction of the
currently adopted Kentucky Building Code.
(Ord. 1242-1985, passed 4-9-85) Penalty, see §
92.99 
§ 92.17 TYPE AND PLACEMENT OF SMOKE DETECTORS.
   (A)   In order to comply with this subchapter only ionization or
photoelectric type detectors approved by a nationally recognized testing
laboratory shall be installed. As an alternative to self- contained smoke
detectors, under certain limited conditions, an approved fire detection system
or a combination thereof may be installed. Each and every alternative system
must be individually approved in written form by the Chief of the Fire
Department, or his designate.
   (B)   Smoke detectors in new residential dwellings shall be wired directly
(hard-wired) to the building's power supply. In existing buildings, it is
preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power supply; however,
the detectors may be powered by self- monitored battery or operated by an
electrical plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device,
provided that the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the main
power supply.
   (C)   Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with applicable N.F.P.A.
Standards (see Supplemental Standards, §
92.19). Detectors may be ceiling or wall mounted, provided that if wall mounted
they shall be within 12 inches, but not closer than six inches of the ceiling.
   (D)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area. As used in this section, "SLEEPING AREA" is defined as the area
or areas of the dwelling unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping rooms) are
located. Where bedrooms or rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by
other use areas (such as kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or
closets), they shall be considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes
of this section. In a dwelling unit which contains a well-defined sleeping room
separated from the other activity areas of the same unit, the detector shall be
located in the corridor within the unit or interior area giving access to the
rooms used for sleeping purposes. Where sleeping areas are separated or where a
single smoke detector will not adequately service all sleeping areas, there
shall be a smoke detector installed adjacent to each sleeping area.
   (E)   In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally located on the
ceiling.
   (F)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any rooming
unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each
dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally located
common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately service all sleeping
areas.
   (G)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed in or near each
stairway leading up to an occupied area in such a manner as to assure that
rising smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector and the detector
intercepts rising smoke before it reaches the occupied area.

detector, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, which are within
his exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant shall be
responsible for notifying the owner when a detector becomes inoperable,
whereafter the owner has ten days in which to repair or replace in operable
condition the detector. In the battery- operated type of detector, battery
replacement shall be the responsibility of the tenant.
   (D)   At every change of tenancy it shall be the duty of the owner to test
and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition.
   (E)   At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by or
incidental to a sale, lease, or sublease of the unit, it shall be the duty of
the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor, or sublessor, as the case may
be) to provide, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke detectors
as required by this section (or other applicable laws) are installed and in
proper working condition. Failure to comply with this division (E) shall be
punishable as set forth herein, provided however, that this division (E) shall
not be construed to violate or render void any contract, lease, or sublease
subject hereto.
   (F)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly connected
(permanently wired) to the electrical system of a structure without the proper
electrical certification.

act of possession, ownership, or control by the city. A close and vacate order
will be rescinded within fourteen (14) days after the criminal activity
nuisance is abated unless such premises is the site of repeated close and
vacate orders.
      (2)   If the premises consist of multi-unit dwellings or mixed uses and

by judicial proceeding.
   (H)   Eviction as a defense.
      (1)   It shall be a defense to a violation of this section if the owner
has instituted an eviction proceeding within thirty (30) days against the
offending tenant or occupants of the offending premises, and the owner
completes the eviction within seventy-five (75) days of commencement or as soon
thereafter as the court procedures allow. In the event that judicial or quasi-
judicial proceedings prohibit an owner from proceeding with an eviction,
abatement of the public nuisance by eviction will be stayed until the judicial

or restrict the ability of the city to bring a separate action to revoke the
occupational license of a landlord or business who allows a criminal activity
nuisance to exist on the landlord's property or to bring an action before the
Code Enforcement Board for the imposition of civil fines, as set forth in §
94.99 . No civil fines will be assessed by the Code Enforcement Board until

structure, dwelling, or premises to inspect, survey, or investigate with the
consent of the owner or occupant, in emergency situations, or when an
inspection, survey, or investigation is required before a permit is issued or
funding is provided by the county or is part of a licensing scheme adopted by

jurisdiction. In addition, a code enforcement officer may obtain a search
warrant to inspect several buildings or structures in a particular area as part

search warrant may be based upon the passage of time, the nature of the
building (e.g., a multi-family apartment house), the condition of the entire
area, or other reasonable legislative or administrative standards adopted by
the county. Probable cause does not need to depend upon specific knowledge of a
condition existing in a particular dwelling. A code enforcement officer
conducting an inspection pursuant to this chapter shall provide identification
and statement of purpose before entering any building, structure, dwelling, or
premises and the person in possession or in charge of the building, structure,
dwelling, or premises shall give the Joint Code Enforcement Board and his or
her assistants, staff, or employees free access to such property for the
purposes set forth herein.

determine and require those conditions that are reasonably necessary to
accomplish the intent of this chapter, including, without limitation:
            1.   A requirement that the applicant post bond with surety

notice from the City Administrative Officer, within 30 days after an
application for a Business Regulatory License required by this chapter has been
referred to the City Administrative Officer for review pursuant to this
chapter, that the application was either conditionally approved or disapproved,
the City Clerk, or any designee thereof shall issue the Business Regulatory
License that is the subject of the application and mail it to the applicant at
the address indicated in the application; and, thereafter, the applicant may
engage in the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business
described in the application, but only at the address thereof indicated in the
application, until that business regulatory license expires or is suspended or
revoked according to the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Conditional approval of application. In the event that the City Clerk

BUSINESS TAXATION
§ 110.25 LEVY AND IMPOSITION.
   For the purpose of providing funds for the general operating expenses of the
city and the municipal services and functions provided thereby, and subject to
the provisions of KRS 67.750 through 67.795, and except as provided in §
110.27, an occupational license fee is hereby levied and imposed upon everybody
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other businesses in
the city, for the privilege of that engagement.
(Ord. 1578-2008, passed 2-19-08)
§ 110.26 RATE.
   (A)   The occupational license fee that is levied and imposed by this
chapter is at the rate of:
      (1)   Employees. One and one-fourths percent of all of the gross
compensation earned by an employee for labor, work or services provided in the
city.
      (2)   Those not an employee. One percent of the net profits of everybody,
other than an employee, who is engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business in the city; but no less than $50 and no more than
$15,000, provided, however, that the Mayor or City Administrative Officer may
waive the $50 minimum in the event of either:
         (a)   The total gross receipts from activities in the city during the
tax period are less than $5,000; and
         (b)   Within 30 days after the close of the tax year of the taxpayer,
the city receives a written request for a refund of the balance of the $50
minimum that has been paid after deducting the tax that is due based on a rate
of 1.0% of the net profits generated in the city.
   (B)   There is hereby reserved to the Mayor or the City Administrative
Officer the right to deny any request for a waiver of the $50 minimum that is
incomplete or fails to follow the process for that waiver described in this
section.
   (C)   The net profits received from the operation of real estate by persons,
trust companies, and real estate agents, for or on behalf of persons (or
estates) are subject to the license fee imposed by the section.

(Ord. 1578-2008, passed 2-19-08; Am. Ord. 1708-2015, passed 12-15-15)
§ 110.27 APPORTIONMENT OF NET PROFITS.
   Pursuant to the authority of KRS 67.753(4), it is hereby determined that the
apportionment provisions of KRS 67.753 do not fairly represent the extent of
the engagement in the City of those, other than an employee, who are engaged in
any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business both within and
outside of the city; and, accordingly, the following described property factor
is hereby added to the payroll factor and the sales factor provided in KRS
67.753 for the apportionment of the net profits of those, other than an
employee, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business both within and outside of the city.
   (A)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or
rented and used in the city during the computation period, and the denominator
of which is the average value of all of the taxpayer's real and tangible
personal property owned or rented and used anywhere during the computation
period. In the determination of the property factor:
      (1)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.
Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental
rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual
rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub-rentals.
      (2)   The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the
values at the beginning and ending of the computation period, but the City
Administrative Officer may require the averaging of monthly values during the
computation period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value
of the taxpayer's property.
   (B)   The proportion of the total net profits everywhere of those, other
than an employee, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business both within and outside of the City that are
subject to the occupational license fee established by this chapter, shall be
determined by multiplying the total net profits thereof everywhere by the
quotient of the total of the payroll factor and the sales factor described in
KRS 67.753(2) and (3), and the property factor described in the previous
division (1), that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business had in the city during the tax period, divided by the total number of
those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business had in the city during the tax period . The total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the city during the tax period will always be either one, two or three. For
example, if the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business:
      (1)   Had only the sales revenue factor in the city, during the tax
period, without either the property factor or the payroll factor in the City,
the total number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business had in the city during the tax period would be
one;
       (2)   Had both the sales revenue factor and the payroll factor in the
city, during the tax period, without the property factor in the city, the total
number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business had in the city during the tax period would be two; or
      (3)   Had the sales revenue factor, and the payroll factor, and the
property factor in the city, during the tax period, the total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had
in the City during the tax period would be three.
(Ord. 1578-2008, passed 2-19-08)
§ 110.28 ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be administered and enforced by the
City Administrative Officer, who is hereby authorized to promulgate any
additional regulations in regard thereto which are not inconsistent with any
state statute, or any ordinance of the City, or any executive order of the
Mayor.
(Ord. 1578-2008, passed 2-19-08)
§ 110.29 PURPOSE OF OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE FEE.
   The purpose of the business regulatory license fees and the Occupational
License Fees imposed and levied by this chapter is to fund the general
operating expenses of the city, including, without limitation, police, fire,
emergency medical, public works and administrative services.
(Ord. 1578-2008, passed 2-19-08)
COLLECTION
§ 110.40 COLLECTION.
   The business regulatory license fees and occupational license fees imposed
and levied by this chapter shall be received and collected by the City Clerk/
Tax Collector or by the Fiscal Court of Kenton County, Kentucky, with which the
executive authority of the city is hereby authorized to contract for those
services.
(Ord. 1578-2008, passed 2-19-08)
§ 110.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Civil penalties. Each separate violation of this chapter is hereby
classified as a civil offense, for which:
      (1)   The maximum civil fine required by KRS 65.8808(2)(b) that may be
imposed for each separate violation of this chapter, is hereby established as
$500; and
      (2)   The specific civil fine required by KRS 65.8808(2)(c) that will be
imposed for each separate offense and violation of this chapter if the person
who has committed the violation and offense does not contest a citation
therefore, is hereby established as $100;
      (3)   An enforcement officer may, in lieu of immediately issuing a civil
citation, give notice that the violation of this chapter shall be remedied
within a specific period of time.
   (B)   Criminal penalties. Each violation of this chapter shall be a
misdemeanor for which everybody convicted thereof in a court of competent
jurisdiction shall be sentenced to pay a criminal fine not to exceed the
maximum amount of $500 as set forth in KRS 534.050 (2)(a) or a term of
imprisonment not to exceed the maximum period of 12 months as set forth in KRS
532.090(1), or both.

§ 120.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Fiscal Court of Kenton County, after consultation among the
mayors, councils, commissioners and staffs of the municipalities and the county
within the County, found that a substantial need exists to revise significantly
the ordinances regarding sexually oriented businesses within Kenton County.
   (B)   The Fiscal Court, in association with the Northern Kentucky Area
Planning Commission and the Fiscal Court of adjacent Campbell County its cities
in the Northern Kentucky Community, retained Duncan Associates to conduct a
study of existing sexually oriented uses and related businesses in Kenton and
Campbell Counties, which is part of a single, larger community.
   (C)   Duncan Associates assigned two nationally-known planners, Eric Damian
Kelly, FAICP and Connie B. Cooper, FAICP, to conduct that study.
   (D)   Kelly and Cooper have completed that study, including the following
elements:
      (1)   Field study, involving visits to all identified existing sexually
oriented businesses in Kenton and Campbell Counties;
      (2)   Meetings with stakeholder groups involved in these businesses;
      (3)   Consultation with the Kenton County, Campbell County Attorney, and
the city attorneys for certain cities, and the community at large on this
issue;
      (4)   Consultation with the professional staff of the Northern Kentucky
Area Planning Commission on this issue;
      (5)   Review of studies and litigation concerning sexually oriented
businesses in other communities;
      (6)   Investigation of regulatory approaches massage therapy;
      (7)   Review of existing ordinances in Kenton and Campbell Counties;
      (8)   Review of similar ordinances in a number of communities outside the
Commonwealth of Kentucky;
      (9)   Review of Kentucky statutes related to regulating sexually oriented
businesses.
   (E)   Duncan Associates has summarized this work and presented
recommendations to the Northern Kentucky Area Planning Commission and Kenton
and Campbell Counties and their cities in an August 2003 report entitled "Site
Visit Analysis: Sexually Oriented and Related Businesses in Kenton and Campbell
Counties" (hereinafter called simply the "Kelly and Cooper Study").
   (F)   That study has also been made available to the legislative bodies of
Kenton and Campbell Counties for their consideration and use.
   (G)   That study has been accepted and used by the Fiscal Court of Kenton
County in adopting the countywide licensing ordinance, Kenton County Ordinance
No. 451.9, as amended, establishing licensing requirements for sexually
oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus in 2004.
   (H)   The United States Supreme Court in City of Renton v. Playtime Theater,
Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), held that local governments may rely upon the
experiences of other cities as well as on its own studies in enacting local
legislation to regulate sexually oriented businesses;
   (I)   The United States Supreme Court in Renton and other cases has held
that a local government may regulate such uses through content-neutral, time,
place, and manner restrictions, so long as said regulations are designed to
serve the government interest and do not unreasonably omit avenues of
communication, and are aimed not at the content of protected speech within said
establishments but rather at the secondary effects of said establishments on
the surrounding communities.
   (J)   The study by Kelly and Cooper found extensive physical interaction
between patrons and dancers at many of the establishments in both Kenton and
Campbell Counties.
   (K)   Covington, the only municipality in Kenton County that has had
sexually oriented businesses within its border, from January 1, 2002, to
February 11, 2004, the police made a total of 469 calls to sexually oriented
businesses in the city. The crimes committed at these establishments during
this time period included robbery, assault, fraud, malicious mischief, public
intoxication, and possession of illegal drugs. In addition, on June 13, 2003,
Covington police arrested three individuals for prostitution-related charges at
Liberty's Show Lounge, a sexually oriented cabaret in the city.
   (L)   As the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals noted in a decision addressing
issues related to the Adult Entertainment ordinance in the City of Newport
(Campbell County), there is a long history underlying efforts to regulate sex
businesses in Northern Kentucky:
      (1)   Defendant City of Newport ("City" or "Newport") long ago gained a
reputation as home to a veritable smorgasbord of vice, attracting patrons from
across the nation. For decades, the small city was considered the Midwest's
answer to Las Vegas, and leaders of organized crime were said to operate its
gambling casinos and nightclubs.
      (2)   In the 1960's, public pressure began to demand that Newport be
cleaned up. This pressure has continued until the present, with varying degrees
of success.
      (3)   A 1986 report generated by the Newport Alcoholic Beverage Control
Administrator indicated that of 28 adult bars opened since 1978 (including
successive bars at the same site), 21 had had at least one prostitution-related
conviction, and 18 had had multiple convictions. Def. Ex. K, p. 2. The report
explained that "all of the prostitution in businesses with adult entertainment
involved an alcoholic beverage as the median [sic] of exchange and the
solicitation of such drinks by 'mixers.'" Id. In all, 98% of prostitution
arrests in Newport occurred in the vicinity of these bars. Id. Adult
entertainment establishments, which constituted 12% of all businesses serving
alcohol, accounted for 17% of all police runs. Def. Ex. K, p. 21.
      (4)   A later review, conducted in 1990 by the Newport License Inspector,
documented the continued prostitution arrests occurring at several adult
dancing establishments. Def. Ex. G. Moreover, the City determined that over
$70,000 was expended in 1990 to target, patrol and prosecute the illicit
behavior occurring in and around the bars. Def. Ex. H.
      (5)   Several of Newport's citizens, merchants and church groups also
opposed the presence of the semi-nude dancing clubs. These groups generally
believed that the adult entertainment clubs were "clouds over [the]
neighborhood that keep [it] from growing in the [right] direction." See Def.
Ex. I (letter to Mayor from Taylors Landing Business District). Complaints
commonly expressed were that the seamy establishments deterred other merchants
from locating in Newport's business district, deterred shoppers, served a poor
example for the City's youth, and generally tarnished the City's image. Id.
Bright Lights, Inc., v. City of Newport, 830 F. Supp. 378, 380-81 (E. D. Ky.
1993).
      (6)   Based on those findings, the court went on to hold in relevant
part:
         (a)   Having considered the matter carefully, the court concludes that
some leeway must be afforded the reform efforts of the City Council of Newport.
This body has been elected by the citizens to attempt to "clean up the image"
of the City.
         (b)   To do this, it must overcome the sleazy impression of Newport
and Northern Kentucky that survives from "the heyday" when things ran wide
open; reform candidates were literally drugged and framed for morals offenses
by public officials and police officers; the members of reform citizens groups
were vilified and harassed; and a "liberal" in local parlance was a person
favoring the continued open and notorious violation of the gambling and morals
laws.
         (c)   To illustrate that the Council's perception of a need to clean
up the image of the City is not paranoid, the court notes the following
statements in a national magazine's satirical Chapter on Newport's big sister,
the City of Cincinnati.
"The city's streets fairly shine; the odd titterer draws a scornful stare. Wide
avenues, bosky side streets, the most inviting of thoroughfares. And clean. So
clean. No X-rated movie theaters, no adult-book stores, no bare-breasted night
joints soil these streets, all of them long ago jettisoned over to the Kentucky
side of the river." (Peter Richmond, "Town Without Pity," Gentlemen's
Quarterly, July 1993, at 102, 104.)
      (7)   This court holds that the City of Newport has the right to secede
as Cincinnati's combat zone.
      (8)   The court holds that the City has "an important and substantial
governmental interest" in advancing these reform goals, which interest is
furthered by the ordinances in question. Barnes, 111 S. Ct. at 2461. The court
further finds and holds that in the case of the City of Newport, given its
unique history, the ordinances' "incidental restriction on alleged First
Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that
interest." Id. (quoting O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 376-77, 88 S. Ct. at 1678-79).
      (9)   Newport's image affects that of all of Northern Kentucky, a
community of nearly 300,000 people. That City and its community have the right
to project a progressive and decent image. The nudity ordinances contribute to
the enhancement of this interest and will be upheld. 830 F.Supp. at 384;
   (M)   The Supreme Court had earlier noted in upholding another regulation in
Newport, "it is plain that, as in Bellanca, the interest in maintaining order
outweighs the interest in free expression by dancing nude." Newport v.
Iacobucci, 479 U.S. 92, 97, 93 L. Ed. 2d 334, 340, 107 S. Ct. 383, 386 (1986).
Although the significance of the opinion itself is now questionable (see J&B
Social Club # 1 v. City of Mobile, 966 F. Supp. 1131, 1135 (S.D. Ala. 1996)),
the quoted part of the opinion stands unchallenged.
   (N)   The cities of Covington and Newport continue their efforts to improve
their image. Since 1985 Covington has redeveloped its riverfront, creating
several new office towers, high-end condominiums, hotels, and a convention
center. In Newport, in conjunction with private development and Southbank
Partners, Inc., the City has built a major entertainment center along the
river. This initiative has promoted improved pedestrian and transit connections
in Northern Kentucky's river cities to and from the stadiums and other
attractions along the Cincinnati riverfront.
   (O)   Despite these efforts, the areas of downtown Covington and Newport
away from the riverfront continue to suffer in many ways. The study by Kelly
and Cooper found in the area near to existing sexually oriented uses a number
of building vacancies and building maintenance falling far short of that found
in the revitalized areas near the river.
   (P)   The City Council respects the Constitutional rights of its citizens,
including the right to present certain types of entertainment that may not
appeal to the entire population. Through this ordinance, it is the desire of
the City Council to balance the Constitutional rights of businesses that
present sexually oriented entertainment with the City Council interests in
ensuring that this community not suffer from the same sorts of adverse effects
that Covington and Newport have long suffered.
   (Q)   From long experience in Covington and Newport, as well as from the
following studies and others not listed, the City Council also finds that such
businesses may have primary and secondary effects involving crimes related to
the activities in the establishments, of which prostitution and crimes of
violence are those of greatest concern. See for example:

      (11)   The Tucson "study" consisting of two memos: one from the Citizens
Advisory Planning Committee, addressed to the Mayor and City Council, and dated
May 14, 1990; and the other from an Assistant Chief of Police to the City
Prosecutor, regarding "Adult Entertainment Ordinance," dated May 1, 1990.
   (R)   The City Council recognizes that some of the cited studies included
bars without sexually oriented entertainment among the businesses studied; the
City Council finds, nevertheless, that addressing the establishments that have
live, sexually oriented entertainment is a more critical local issue than that
of bars without such entertainment, for three reasons:
      (1)   Bars in Kentucky are already regulated by the Commonwealth, and
those state regulations directly address many of the concerns that arise with
the service of alcohol;
      (2)   The local history of prostitution and sex-related crimes has
largely been related to businesses with live, sexually oriented entertainment,
and not with other establishments that serve alcohol; and
      (3)   The interaction between dancers who are paid to work with very
limited clothing and the customers who pay to see them work in the
establishments with live entertainment creates a sexually charged environment
and the opportunity to negotiate for the provision of additional services that
do not involve dancing or other protected expression and that are simply
unacceptable under the standards of the County and its citizens.
   (S)   As noted earlier in these findings, there is a long local history of
prostitution and sex-related crimes at or incident to the operation of
establishments with live, sexually oriented entertainment. Further, the studies
shown herein provide further evidence of the potential crime-related secondary
effects from such businesses. Although the methodologies and quality of these
studies vary somewhat local experience has demonstrated to the City Council
that the relationship between crime and such establishments is a fact in
Northern Kentucky and not just a theory published in a study.
   (T)   The City Council has reviewed evidence and testimony presented at
public meetings before the County, and information based on the past
experiences of the Kenton and Campbell Counties and the cities of Covington and
Newport, the experiences of the County Attorneys' offices prosecuting numerous
and varied offenses that have occurred in and around the sexually oriented
entertainment establishments, and based upon the documented experiences of
other governmental units within Kentucky and elsewhere in dealing with the
impact of sexually oriented entertainment, that such businesses can, if not
properly regulated, be deleterious to said community.
   (U)   The City Council finds that the countywide licensing ordinance related
to sexually oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus adopted by
the Fiscal Court of Kenton County is an effective tool for addressing the many
operational issues that can arise with such businesses.
   (V)   The City Council finds that amendments to the city’s Zoning Ordinance
regarding the location and design of such businesses are important variables in
the nature and extent of adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses on the community, and further finds that location and design are
among the types of issues that are typically addressed through zoning.
   (W)   Based on the recommendations of Kelly and Cooper, which are based on
their experience in other communities and their review of the studies cited
above and other local efforts to address such secondary effects the City
Council finds that the following principles are essential to effective zoning
controls of sexually oriented businesses:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses should, to the maximum extent
practicable, be separated from one another by a distance that is greater than a
convenient walking distance, because experience elsewhere has shown that the
location of such businesses near one another may increase the adverse secondary
effects, particularly those related to crime, by a greater than arithmetic
factor;
      (2)   Although there are currently several such businesses located near
one another in Covington's downtown area, the Covington City Commission has
determined that the city will not attempt to require these existing businesses
be relocated;
      (3)   Sexually oriented businesses have the greatest adverse effect on
residential neighborhoods and should thus be separated to the maximum extent
practicable from residential neighborhoods;
      (4)   Sexually oriented businesses are likely to attract criminal
elements that prey on "soft targets," including children, and it is thus
important to separate sexually oriented businesses from schools, parks,
recreation centers, and religious institutions, all of which are places where
children are likely to congregate, often without parental protection;
      (5)   Also because of the tendency of sexually oriented businesses to
attract criminal elements that prey on soft targets, it is important to seek
locations for such businesses that are not located along pedestrian routes,
where young people, old people and others who are vulnerable, are likely to
walk in going about their day-to-day business. Thus, locations to which the
primary access is by automobile minimize the risk of persons going about their
daily business encountering persons who are visiting or even loitering around
the sexually oriented business;
      (6)   Experiences in other communities show that private booths, back
rooms, "VIP" rooms and other small and private spaces in sexually oriented
businesses create the opportunity for casual sexual activity and create
logistical difficulties and risks of physical endangerment for police officers
responsible for dealing with such activities. For that reason, it is essential
that movies, performances and other activities at sexually oriented businesses
should be permitted only in large rooms that are open and visible to
management, other patrons and code and police officers who may visit the
establishment during operating hours.
   (X)   Findings. The facts and other matters set forth in divisions (A)
through (W) that form the preamble to this chapter are hereby adopted as
findings of fact in support of the legislative action of the City Council in
adopting this amendment to the Zoning Ordinance. Upon adoption of this zoning
amendment, these shall be incorporated into the Zoning Code by reference as if
fully set forth therein to the adopting Resolution.

provided for otherwise in this chapter.
   (B)   Construction procedures and placement of facilities; obligation to
minimize interference with the right-of-way:
      (1)   All activities in the right-of-way that are subject to this chapter
shall be performed in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances,
departmental rules, and regulations. Each party subject to this chapter must
obtain all other necessary franchises, permits, licenses, and authority and pay
all fees required by this chapter or other applicable rule, law, or regulation.
      (2)   The city may require that facilities be installed at a particular
time, at a specific place or location, or in a particular manner as a condition
of access to a particular right-of-way; may deny access if a party is not
willing to comply with the city's reasonable requirements; and may, unless
prohibited by law, remove, or require removal of, any facility that is not

facilities are contained in §
156.18. Regardless of any other criteria, in the event the placement or
location of a facility in a particular area of the right-of-way would
constitute a public safety concern, the City Administrator may deny the
placement of that facility in that area or order its relocation or removal.
      (3)   In order to minimize interference with the use of the right-of-way
by others, each party subject to this chapter will make reasonable efforts to
minimize the number of surface cuts made, will make reasonable efforts to

may be extended by the City Administrator upon demonstration of reasonable
cause by the subject party. A party's failure to take reasonable steps to
complete all restoration work due under a surface cut permit within the time
period stated above will result in the cost of the permit fee required pursuant
to §
156.22(B) being re-assessed as an additional fee each time there is a failure
to meet the time limit. Any additional fee(s) shall be assessed at the time of
inspection or reinspection and payable to the city in addition to the amount of
the original fee(s) provided for in §
156.22(B) and (C).

limitation, all facilities, including, but not limited to, poles, towers,
support structures, and manholes, must be maintained in a safe condition at all
times. In the event any facility in the right-of-way is endangering the public
safety, the party responsible for such facility shall take steps to rectify the
situation immediately upon notification and in accordance with §

parties subject to this chapter shall, upon the provision of reasonable written
notice of, and at the direction of the City Administrator, promptly relocate or
remove facilities, or rearrange aerial facilities, if required by a tariff,
state or federal law, a franchise agreement with the city, or the City
Administrator in exercising his/her authority under §

equitable title to the right-of-way, nor does it place a registrant in a
position of priority with respect to other registrants. Registration does not
excuse a party from having to obtain a franchise, lease, or other agreement, if
otherwise required; or from obtaining any required or necessary agreement with

         (b)   It significantly conflicts with the timing of other ongoing
activity taking place in the same area of the right-of-way, or with a
previously scheduled activity;
         (c)   It conflicts with the planned grading, re-grading, construction,
reconstruction, widening or altering of any right-of-way or the construction,
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or alteration of a public improvement,
including, but not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and streetlights;
         (d)   It conflicts with an approved development plan in that
geographic area that requires all or certain types of facilities to be located
in certain locations, areas, or parts of the right-of-way;
         (e)   It is an above-ground facility other than a fire hydrant or
other city-owned facility, that because of its size presents significant public
safety concerns or violates guidelines or procedures pertaining to aesthetics
found in §
156.19 or as otherwise duly authorized by Council or the City Administrator;
         (f)   It fails to take reasonable measures to disguise or cover the
facility as required by the city pursuant to guidelines or procedures
pertaining to aesthetics found in §
156.19 or as otherwise duly authorized by Council or the City Administrator;
         (g)   It conflicts with a requirement contained in the applicant's
franchise agreement or interlocal agreement;
         (h)   It is located in a type of right-of-way, such as a bicycle lane
or path, in which the city has made a determination that facilities are not to
be installed;
         (i)   It would threaten public health, safety, or welfare or otherwise
constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter; or
         (j)   The applicant is not otherwise in material compliance with the
provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Reservation of rights. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
chapter, the city specifically reserves the right to order the removal or
relocation of any facility installed after the effective date of this chapter,
at no cost to the city, for which an installation permit or surface cut permit
was not obtained.
      (5)   Preclusion on cutting newly paved surfaces. If any street is about
to be resurfaced by the city, on advance written notice from the City
Administrator pursuant to §
156.18 (C), the registrant shall make any extensions, changes, or installations
of or to its facilities ahead of such activity. Registrant shall notify City
Administrator by July 15 of its desire to perform such extensions, changes, or
installations, and may be allowed up to ninety (90) additional days to complete
the work. If any street is about to be constructed, reconstructed, widened,
altered, or paved by the city, upon receipt of final plans from the City
Administrator, the registrant shall make any extensions, changes, or
installations of or to its facilities ahead of such activity. Depending on the
amount of such extensions, changes, or installations to be performed, the
registrant may be allowed up to one hundred twenty (120) days to complete the
work. If the registrant fails to do such extensions, changes, or installations,
it shall be precluded for a period of one (1) year from disturbing such paving
without the express permission of the City Administrator. The City
Administrator shall only grant such permission upon a sufficient showing by the
registrant that undue hardship would be caused if the registrant were not
allowed to disturb the pavement and that it shall satisfactorily comply with
all other relevant provisions of this chapter, including the requirements
contained in §
156.24(A) pertaining to resurfacing.
   (F)   Relocations. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the city shall have
the ability to order the relocation of any facility located within the right-
of-way. The city shall not normally direct the exact location that the facility
is to be relocated to, but instead shall work with the registrant or permittee
as part of the permitting process. There shall be no fee associated with a
permit required as a result of a relocation ordered by the city.
      (1)   Public projects. Whenever the city shall grade, regrade, construct,
reconstruct, widen or alter any right-of-way or shall construct, reconstruct,
repair, maintain or alter a public improvement, including, but not limited to,
storm sewers, sanitary sewers and street lights therein, it shall be the duty
of the registrant, when so ordered by the city, to change, relay and relocate
its facilities in the right-of-way at no cost to the city so as to conform to
the established grade or line of such right-of-way and so as not to interfere
with such public improvements so constructed, reconstructed or altered.
However, notwithstanding the above, if as part of said public improvement the
city orders that facilities that were previously and lawfully located above-
ground, to be relocated to underground, the city shall bear the cost for the
difference in cost between an aerial and underground facility of the same type,
unless an agreement to the contrary is otherwise entered into by the
appropriate parties.
      (2)   Relocation for public safety reasons. If the basis for the city
ordering the relocation of a facility is a public safety concern, the
registrant shall relocate the facility at no cost to the city.
      (3)   Relocations to assist in the placement of other facilities. If the
reason the city is ordering the relocation is to assist in the installation of
facilities by another registrant or permittee, the party seeking to install the
facilities shall bear the costs of said relocation, unless an agreement is
otherwise reached.
      (4)   Relocations where the cost is borne by the city. Notwithstanding
any language in this chapter to the contrary, unless an agreement to the
contrary is otherwise entered into by the appropriate parties, the cost of the
following types of relocations shall be borne by the city:
         (a)   If the reason the city is ordering the relocation is that it has
adopted a plan or policy requiring that facilities be placed underground in
that location, if, at the time the facility was installed, such a plan was not
in place;
         (b)   If, at the time the facility was installed, the location in
which the facility is currently sited was not a part of the right-of-way or was
not otherwise owned or controlled by the city;
         (c)   If the city has already ordered that the facility be relocated
to comply with a public improvement project, the registrant or party has
substantially complied with such order, and the city then orders the registrant
or party to relocate that facility to a different area as part of the same
project; or
         (d)   If the city orders the relocation of a facility to accommodate a
public improvement project and the construction of such project is subsequently
terminated by the Council.
   (G)   Removal.
      (1)   If the city requires a facility that is no longer being used to
provide service, as defined below, to be taken out of the right-of-way, such
removal shall be pursuant to the requirements of this division. However,
abandoned sewer and water facilities shall not be required to be removed, but
shall be required to be filled and capped.
      (2)   Definition. A facility shall be considered to be "NO LONGER IN USE"
if such facility has not been used to provide service or support the provision
of service for a period of one (1) year, or the registrant or the party
responsible for the facility has notified the City Administrator that it no
longer intends to use the facility. If the city determines that a facility is
"no longer in use" based on the fact that it has not been used for a period of
more than one (1) year, the responsible party may petition the City
Administrator for a reasonable extension of time based on that party's desire
to use the facility to provide service or to sell or transfer such facility
within a reasonable amount of time. Such an extension of time shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
      (3)   Procedure for notification. Any party discontinuing use of a
facility shall notify the City Administrator in writing of such discontinued
use within thirty (30) days. Said notice shall describe the facilities for
which the use is to be discontinued and include a statement as to whether the
registrant intends to leave the facilities in place for potential future use,
remove the facilities, or abandon the facilities in place. The registrant shall
remain responsible for the maintenance, repair, and condition of discontinued
facilities at all times.
      (4)   Criteria and procedure for removal. Upon providing reasonable
advanced written notice to the registrant or other responsible party, the City
Administrator may order the removal of any facility that has been determined to
be "no longer in use", if any of the following arise with respect to that
facility:
         (a)   It significantly conflicts with the location of existing
facilities or facilities that are planned or permitted for installation, or
city improvements or facilities that are planned in that area;
         (b)   It conflicts with the planned grading, re-grading, construction,
reconstruction, widening or altering of any right-of-way or the construction,
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or alteration of a public improvement,
including, but not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and streetlights;
         (c)   It conflicts with an approved development plan in that
geographic area that requires all or certain types of facilities to be located
in certain locations, areas, or parts of the right-of-way;
         (d)   It conflicts with a requirement contained in that party's
franchise agreement or interlocal agreement;
         (e)   The current location of the facility threatens public health,
safety, or welfare or otherwise constitutes a violation of the provisions of
this chapter; or
         (f)   It is an above-ground facility that has been determined to be
"no longer in use" for a period of more than ninety (90) days.
      (5)   Facilities located underground. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
city shall not order the removal of any underground facility unless the surface
above the facility is currently being, or will be, substantially excavated, or
the presence of that facility causes an emergency or threatens public health,
safety, or welfare. In any event, the removal of such a facility shall be
limited to that portion of the facility that actually presents an issue.
      (6)   Cost of removal. The city shall not bear any portion of the cost of
the removal of any facility or filling and capping water or sewer facilities,
unless it is part of a city project, and the costs of such removal (or filling
and capping) are minimal. Depending on the circumstances, the City
Administrator may order that the party responsible for such facility, the party
seeking a permit, or both, bear the costs and the responsibility of such
removal (or filling and capping). However, in the event that the facility is
being removed to accommodate the placement of a non-city facility, the cost of
such removal shall be the responsibility of the party or parties applying for
the permit, so long as the existing facility was lawfully installed.
      (7)   In the event the registrant or other responsible party elects to
abandon the facility in place and the Council approves such abandonment, the
registrant or party shall convey full title and ownership of such abandoned
facility to the city in consideration of the abandonment in place and without
the need of the city to pay compensation to the registrant, except as otherwise
provided by applicable law. The registrant shall, however, continue to be
responsible for all taxes on such facilities or other liabilities associated
therewith, until the date the same is conveyed to the city.
      (8)   Should any registrant or other responsible party fail, after
notice, to remove a facility (or in the case of water or sewer facilities, fill
and cap abandoned facilities) upon the order of the City Administrator as
specified in this section, the city may, at its option and in addition to the
imposition of any other remedies hereunder or in a franchise agreement or
interlocal agreement with that party, undertake or cause to be undertaken, such
necessary removal. The city shall have no liability for any damage caused by
such removal and the registrant or other responsible party shall be liable to
the city for all reasonable costs incurred by the city in such removal.
(Ord. 1818-2022, passed 9-13-22)
§ 156.19 AESTHETIC STANDARDS.
   Unless otherwise approved by the city in order to prevent an effective
prohibition of service in accordance with federal regulations, as applicable,
no person shall locate or maintain a new facility, pole, tower, or support
structure, except in accordance with the following design standards:
   (A)   All facilities shall be located and designed so as to minimize visual
impact on surrounding properties and from public right-of-way.
   (B)   All new or replacement poles, towers, or support structures placed in
the right-of-way shall be the same color, shape, material, and general height
as those existing poles or towers adjacent to the location of the new or
replacement pole, tower, or support structure.
   (C)   All coaxial, fiber-optic, or other cabling and wires shall be
contained inside any new or replacement tower, pole, or other support structure
to the extent technically and commercially feasible. On existing poles or
support structures, or new wooden poles, where it is impossible or infeasible
to place wiring inside the pole or support structure, all coaxial, fiber-optic,
or other cabling and wires shall be flush-mounted and covered with a metal,
plastic, or similar material, which, to the extent feasible, shall match the
color of the pole or support structure. All coaxial, fiber-optic, or other
cabling and wires shall be contained inside any new tower or pole placed in the
right-of-way to the extent technically and commercially feasible.
   (D)   No tower shall be placed in the right-of-way within two hundred fifty
(250) feet on the same street of an existing tower. Replacing an existing tower
with a tower, or a lighted pole with another lighted pole housing wireless
facilities, in the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (E)   All new towers and poles should be located on the same side of the
street as existing towers, poles, or support structures. However, this does not
preclude an applicant from locating its wireless facilities on existing lighted
poles under a decommissioning agreement in which the applicant takes ownership
of the lighted pole.
   (F)   The centerline of any new pole or tower shall be aligned with the
centerline of adjacent poles or trees unless the new structure's height
conflicts with overhead power utility lines. Replacing an existing pole,
support structure, or tower with another pole, support structure, or tower in
the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (G)   All new poles, towers, or facilities proposed to be fronting a
dwelling shall be placed on property lines, unless it would obstruct sight
distance at driveways or other accesses to roadways. In those instances where
placement of a new pole or tower, or facilities on the property line would
obstruct sight distance, the pole or tower, or facilities shall be placed in
such a location as to prevent the obstruction of sight distance at driveways or
other accesses to roadways. Replacing an existing pole, support structure,
tower or facility with a pole, support structure, tower, or facility in the
same location shall not violate this provision.
   (H)   New poles, towers, or facilities shall not be placed in front of store
front windows, walkways, entrances or exits, or in such a way that would impede
deliveries. Replacing an existing pole, support structure, tower, or facility
with a pole, support structure, tower, or facility in the same location shall
not violate this provision.
   (I)   No new poles or towers shall be placed in front of driveways,
entrances, or walkways. Replacing an existing pole, support structure, or tower
with a pole, support structure, or tower in the same location shall not violate
this provision.
   (J)   No applicant shall locate or maintain a pole, support structure,
tower, or equipment associated with a wireless facility, as to interfere with
the health of a tree.
   (K)   In areas where the undergrounding of utilities has occurred, but
lighted poles are present, the applicant shall locate its wireless facilities
on existing lighted poles or seek to decommission the lighted pole to replace
it with a lighted pole to house its wireless facilities. However, an applicant
must consider the aesthetics of the existing utilities and neighborhoods
adjacent to a proposed wireless facility location prior to submitting an
application. Applicants shall consider and make best efforts to match existing,
adjacent streetscape character. Also, when a wireless facility is proposed to
be installed within Downtown Elsmere, the applicant must consider and propose
infrastructure that most closely matches adjacent themed infrastructure to the
maximum extent feasible. The characteristics of unique assemblies may include
mast aims, decorative pole bases, architectural luminaires, mounting heights,
pole colors, etc.
   (L)   If the applicant elects to decommission an existing lighted pole in
order to install a wireless facility in its location, the applicant shall
comply with this chapter, including these aesthetic standards, and any
decommissioning agreement between the applicant, the City of Elsmere, and
Kentucky Utilities, or its equivalent.
   (M)   In those locations where the undergrounding of utilities has occurred,
all new facilities shall be placed underground.
   (N)   No equipment associated with any facility shall impede, obstruct, or
hinder ADA access, or pedestrian or vehicular access, or block driveways,
entrances, or walkways. The installation of new ground furniture is prohibited.
   (O)   To protect the health and safety of the public from the harms of noise
pollution, all facilities shall have a low noise profile.
   (P)   Within twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date the operator
receives notice thereof, operator shall remove all graffiti on any of its
facilities located in the right-of-way.
   (Q)   All facilities, poles, towers, and support structures shall comply
with such additional design standards as may be set forth in any written
policies or guidelines issued by the city.
   (R)   All poles, towers, support structures, and other lines and equipment
installed or erected by registrant under this chapter shall be located so as to
minimize any interference with the proper use of the right-of-way with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners whose property adjoins or
abuts any affected right-of-way. Subject to applicable codes, overhead drops
shall be as close as possible to other utility drops in order to concentrate
the drops in as small an area as possible to minimize visual clutter and
interference with the use of private property.
   (S)   In areas already served by overhead utilities within an alley,
wireless facilities must also be located in the alley. No wireless facilities
will be permitted in front of residential properties if the area does not
currently have overhead utilities or streetlights along the right-of-way
frontage. Relief from this requirement will require a written statement from
the utility owning the existing poles within the alley that said poles will not
accommodate the proposed facilities.
(Ord. 1818-2022, passed 9-13-22)
§ 156.20 POLES, TOWERS, AND SUPPORT STRUCTURES.
   (A)   To the extent possible, registrants shall use existing poles, towers,
support structures, and conduit existing at the time of permitting in
installing their facilities.
   (B)   All poles, towers, support structures, or wire holding structures are
subject to any applicable, duly adopted regulations regarding location, height,
type, or other pertinent aspect, including those found in §
156.19.
   (C)   All transmission and distribution structures, poles, towers, support
structures, and other lines and equipment installed or erected by registrant
under this chapter shall be located to minimize any interference with the
proper use of the right-of-way with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners whose property adjoins or abuts any affected right-of-way.
Subject to applicable codes, overhead drops shall be as close as possible to
other utility drops in order to concentrate the drops in as small an area as
possible to minimize visual clutter and interference with the use of private
property.
(Ord. 1818-2022, passed 9-13-22)
§ 156.21 PERMITS REQUIRED; NOTICE OF ACTIVITIES; EXCEPTIONS; DENIALS.
   Unless otherwise exempted by this chapter, any party performing an activity
within the right-of-way that requires a permit pursuant to this chapter must
obtain the applicable permit prior to the performance of such activity and pay
any applicable permit fee.
   (A)   Each time that a registrant is performing any of the activities listed
below, it shall provide the city written notification. Text messages shall not
be considered written notice. Any work performed without proper written
notification shall constitute work being done without a permit, and as such
subject to the levy of fines.
      (1)   Installation or replacement of wiring on existing towers, support
structures, or poles when the work: (a) necessitates presence in the right-of-
way for more than one (1) day; or (b) involves more than one thousand (1,000)
line feet of cable or wire;
      (2)   Replacement of existing towers, support structures, or poles when
the work: (a) necessitates presence in the right-of-way for more than two (2)
days; or (b) involves more than one thousand (1,000) line feet of cable or
wire;
      (3)   Excavations of existing facilities from ten (10) to twenty-five
(25) square feet with no street or sidewalk cuts;
      (4)   Installation of new underground lines in trenches of less than two
hundred fifty (250) linear feet with a width of six (6) inches or less and with
no street, curb, apron, or sidewalk cuts;
      (5)   Installation of new underground lines in trenches of fifty (50)
linear feet or less with a width of twenty-four (24) inches or less and with no
street, curb, apron, or sidewalk cuts;
      (6)   An underground boring larger than three (3) inches in diameter; or
      (7)   Any underground boring located under a paved street. The
notification shall consist of, at a minimum, the name of the registrant, a
general description of the location (by address(es) or street(s)) and the
nature or type of the activity performed (e.g., installation of wiring, boring,
tower/support structure/pole replacement, etc.). In the event that the
notification cannot be provided to the city's website said notification may be
provided in writing via e-mail or facsimile transmission. Notwithstanding the
above, permits shall not be required for inspections, CCTVs or clearing debris
from facilities.
   (B)   An installation permit or a surface cut permit for the performance of
non-emergency work shall be applied for at least ten (10) days prior to such
planned activity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Administrator may
waive said time period for good cause shown. The City Administrator must
approve, deny, or conditionally approve a permit application within five (5)
business days of the receipt of the application and in the case of a
conditional approval or denial, state in writing the basis for such
determination and what conditions must be met by the applicant in order to
obtain a permit. Any work performed without proper notification shall
constitute work being done without a permit, and as such subject to the levy of
fines.
   (C)   A permit issued pursuant to an emergency shall be applied for no later
than five (5) business days after the discovery of the emergency.
   (D)   All applications for permits shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The identity and legal status of the applicant (the party to whom
the permit is issued).
      (2)   The name, address and telephone number of the officer, agent or
employee requesting the permit.
      (3)   A description of all activities covered by the permit, and in the
case of an installation permit or a surface cut permit the locations and

      (4)   The number of all surface cuts covered by the surface cut permit,
and the number of square feet of right-of-way surface to be removed; or the
number of linear feet included in the installation.
   (E)   A single permit may be issued for multiple surface cuts or
installations; provided that no such surface cut or installation covered in a
single permit shall be more than three hundred (300) feet apart.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Administrator may grant a single permit
for multiple surface cuts or installations that are more than three hundred
(300) feet upon a showing by the permit applicant that such an expansion of
activity shall not significantly affect the City Administrator's ability to
efficiently administer this chapter.
   (F)   Notification of inspections. If the City Administrator knows at the
time of the issuance of the permit that it shall require an inspection(s), it
will notify the permittee that such an inspection(s) is required.
   (G)   Denial or revocation. The City Administrator, in his/her reasonable
discretion, may deny or revoke a permit for failure to satisfy the material
requirements and conditions of this chapter, including but not limited to the
criteria contained in §
156.19  or if the denial is otherwise necessary to protect the health, safety,
and welfare of the citizens of the City of Elsmere. In addition, the City
Administrator may issue a permit that is contingent upon the applicant
performing certain requirements that shall be specified in the permit.
   (H)   Exceptions. Permits are not required to be obtained pursuant to this
chapter if the facilities involved are of the following nature. However, the
party responsible for such facilities is required to comply with all remaining
provisions of this chapter as well as any other chapter that may apply, unless
otherwise exempted:

§ 156.22 PERMIT FEES; CREDITS; DISPLAY.
   (A)   Installation permit. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, every party
obtaining an installation permit shall pay a fee of one hundred dollars ($100)
for each installation permit. Any immediately adjoining real property owner
cited to replace, repair, restore, or otherwise maintain any sidewalk, curb,
apron, or utility strip for which that real property owner is legally
responsible shall be exempt from paying and fees for obtaining an installation
permit for these activities. This fee shall be re-assessed in the event that
any work commences without approval as provided in §
156.18(A).
   (B)   Surface cut permit. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, every party
obtaining a surface cut permit shall pay a fee of one hundred dollars ($100)
for each surface cut permit. This fee shall be re-assessed each time a party
fails to comply with §
156.07 (B)(4), or in the event that any work commences without approval as
provided in §
156.09 (A).
   (C)   New pole, tower, or support structure permit. Unless otherwise
prohibited by law, every party obtaining a pole, tower or support structure
permit shall pay a fee of two hundred seventy dollars ($270.00) for each new

(Ord. 1818-2022, passed 9-13-22)
§ 156.23 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Unless otherwise prohibited by law or otherwise provided in a valid
franchise agreement or interlocal agreement with the city, in order to ensure
performance, each registrant seeking a surface cut permit must establish a
performance bond in favor of the city to be issued by an entity subject to
jurisdiction and venue in the city in an amount to be determined by the City
Administrator in consultation with the City Administrator and the City
Engineer, which shall be in effect for and cover all surface cuts made by that
party for a period of two (2) years after the final inspection and approval of
the surface cut by the City Administrator. There shall be recoverable, jointly,
and severally, from the principle and surety of the bond, any damages or loss
suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any right-of-way
repair, compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any
property of the registrant, plus attorney's fees and costs, up to the full
amount of the bond.
   (B)   The bond shall contain the following endorsement:
   "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by
the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until thirty
(30) days after receipt by the City of Elsmere, via registered mail, a written
notice of such intent to cancel or not to renew."
   (C)   In no event shall the amount required by the City Administrator for
the performance bond exceed the reasonable costs of repairing the activity
affiliated with the surface cut permits. This provision shall not apply to the
city. In lieu of a performance bond, the City Administrator may allow the
applicant for a surface cut permit to deposit with the City Administrator an
amount appropriate to cover the city's cost of repairing the surface cut; to be
held for a similar period. The city reserves the right to impose additional
security requirements as part of any surface cut permit or franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1818-2022, passed 9-13-22)
§ 156.24 PATCHING AND RESTORATION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Standards. Patching and restoration of the right-of-way shall be
performed according to the applicable standards and with the materials
specified by the City Administrator, and at a minimum shall comply with the
applicable standard engineering drawing. The City Administrator shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis in
accordance with the criteria listed below. All edges of a surface cut made to a
paved street must be sawed and such surface cuts must be sealed with a sealant
approved by the City Administrator. In addition, the City Administrator must
approve all backfill material utilized. In most instances, the minimum
standards will apply. However, in certain limited instances, the City
Administrator may determine that the minimum standards do not adequately
protect the city because of at least one (1) of the following considerations:
      (1)   The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions, or damage to the right-of-way;
      (2)   The traffic volume earned by the right-of-way;
      (3)   The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way;
      (4)   The remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the
excavation; or
      (5)   The surface cut was made in violation of §
156.18(E)(5).
   (B)   Guarantees. Each party performing excavations pursuant to a permit
required by this chapter guarantees its restoration work and shall maintain it
for two (2) years following its completion. During this period, it shall, upon
notification from the City Administrator, correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the City Administrator.
(Ord. 1818-2022, passed 9-13-22)
§ 156.25 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Site inspection. Any party issued a permit pursuant to this chapter
shall make the worksite available to the City Administrator and to all others
as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the
execution of and upon completion of the work. No excavation shall be covered
until it has been inspected and approved by the City Administrator if the City
Administrator has given that party notice of its intent to inspect the
excavation. The permittee shall provide the City Administrator with advance
notice of at least one (1) day when the appropriate portion of the activity is
ready for inspection, and if the City Administrator fails to inspect after
being provided such notice, the permittee may continue to perform the permitted
activity. Any excavation that has been covered without a required approval or
inspection shall be uncovered for inspection at that party's expense, upon
request of the City Administrator. If the construction or restoration does not
meet the standards under this chapter, the City Administrator may order
corrective measures.
   (B)   Authority of the City Administrator.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the City Administrator may order the
immediate cessation of any work that it in good faith believes poses a serious
threat to the life, health, safety, or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The City Administrator may issue an order to the permittee for any
work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable
ordinance, resolution, regulation, standard, condition, or code. The order
shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation
of the permit. The permittee shall proceed with the corrective work before
undertaking any additional work under the permit. Within ten (10) days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the City
Administrator that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the required time, the City Administrator may revoke the
permit, or for good cause shown, extend the period of time allowed for the
corrective work to be completed.
