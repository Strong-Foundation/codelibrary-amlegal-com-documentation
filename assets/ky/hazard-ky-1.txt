such part to one or more major sections or divisions of the municipality, or

and future growth of the municipality, with due regard to its relation to
neighboring territory. The plan shall be made with the general purpose of
guiding and accomplishing a coordinated, adjusted, and harmonious development

a single resolution or may by successive resolutions adopt successive parts of
the plan, these parts corresponding with major geographical sections or
divisions of the city or with functional subdivisions of the subject matter of
the plan, and may adopt any amendment or extension thereof or addition thereto.
Before the adoption of the plan or of any part, amendment, extension, or
addition thereto, the Planning Commission shall hold at least one public
hearing thereon. Notice of the hearing shall be published in accordance with
KRS Chapter 424. The adoption of the plan or of any part or amendment,
extension, or addition shall be by resolution of the Planning Commission
carried by the affirmative vote of not less than a simple majority of the total
membership of the Planning Commission. The resolution shall refer expressly to
the maps and descriptive and other matter intended by the Planning Commission
to form the whole or part of the plan, and the action taken shall be recorded
on the map and plan and descriptive matter by the identifying signature of the
Chairperson or Secretary of the Planning Commission. An attested copy of the
plan or part thereof shall be certified to the Board of Commissioners and
lodged for record as provided by law.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may from time to time amend, extend, or add
to the plan; publish and distribute copies of the plan or any report and employ
other means of publicity and education as it may determine; authorize its
members to attend city planning conferences or meetings of city planning
institutes or hearings upon pending city planning legislation, and by
resolution spread upon its minutes, pay the reasonable traveling expenses
incident to such attendance. The Planning Commission shall from time to time
recommend to the appropriate public officials programs for public structures
and improvements, and for the financing thereof. It shall consult and advise
with public officials and agencies, public utility companies, civic,
educational, and other organizations, and citizens with relation to protecting
or carrying out the plan. The Planning Commission shall have the right to
accept and use gifts for the exercise of its functions. It may require from all
public officials, within a reasonable time, such available information as is

employees, in the performance of their functions, may enter upon land and make
examinations and surveys and place and maintain necessary monuments and markers
thereon. The Planning Commission shall have general powers to enable it to
fulfill its functions.
      (4)   The Planning Commission is authorized and directed to exercise
subdivision control within the jurisdiction and of the character provided by
law. The Planning Commission shall make subdivision regulations to provide for
the proper arrangement of streets, in relation to other existing or planned
streets, and to the master plan, for adequate and convenient open spaces for
traffic, utilities, access of fire-fighting apparatus, recreation, light, and
air, and for the avoidance of congestion of population, including minimum width
and area of lots. These regulations may also include provisions as to the
extent to which streets and other ways shall be graded and improved, and to
which water, sewer, and other utility mains, piping, or other facilities shall
be installed as a condition precedent to the tentative approval of the plat
prior to installation; but any such tentative approval shall be revocable and
shall not be entered on the plat. In lieu of the completion of these
improvements and utilities prior to the final approval of the plat, the
Planning Commission may accept a bond with surety to secure to the city the
actual construction and installation of these improvements or utilities at a
time and according to specifications fixed by or in accordance with the
regulations of the Planning Commission. All subdivision regulations shall be
published as provided by law for the publication of ordinances and, before
adoption, a public hearing shall be held thereon. A copy thereof shall be
certified by the Planning Commission to the County Court Clerk.

   (A)   A police officer is a person duly qualified, appointed, and sworn to
enforce and execute the criminal laws of the state and ordinances of the city.
His authority extends to criminal cases only. If called upon to assist in a

   (B)   His authority may be exercised whenever circumstances require, whether
he is in uniform and on active duty or not.
   (C)   His general duties are to protect life and property, prevent the
commission of crime, arrest offenders, and preserve the public peace. All

all laws of the state, the United States government, and ordinances of the city
at all times. They shall arrest any and all persons violating any of these laws
in their presence.
(Ord. 320.2B, passed 11-6-81)
§ 34.05 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Every patrol officer shall hold himself in readiness at all times to
perform the duties of his office. A patrol officer shall:
      (1)   Patrol his beat and perform such other duties as shall from time to
time be ordered by the Police Chief.
      (2)   Conform to the rules and regulations of the Police Department,
observe all laws and city ordinances, assist in all traffic matters, and render
his services to the city with zeal, courage, discretion, and fidelity.
      (3)   Be present at daily ro11-call and attend at the station house at
the time appointed. If an officer is absent without leave, he shall be reported
to the Chief of Police.
      (4)   Immediately after ro11-call proceed to his beat and relieve the
patrol officer whose tour of duty has expired. The patrol officer going off
duty shall communicate to his relieving associate everything he knows relating
to police business on their beat, so that they both may act in concert for the
public good.
      (5)   Confine his patrol within the limits of his beat, except with
permission of his superior officer, or in cases of fire, arrest of any person,
or other necessary absence on duty, until the time assigned for the expiration
of his tour of duty and he is regularly relieved. He shall, if obliged to leave
his beat for any purpose, notify the station when he leaves and when he
returns, stating the cause.
      (6)   Continuously and carefully patrol and inspect every part of his
beat when on a tour of duty.
      (7)   Be diligent, courteous, and active in patrolling his beat, neither
neglecting friendliness nor wasting time in unnecessary conversation.
      (8)   Assume a military bearing and avoid careless loungings or
undignified attitude when on patrol duty.
      (9)   In dealing with the public, be kind and courteous, but firm and
decided. He shall carefully and continuously patrol his beat, note obstructions
and dangerous places caused by excavations, building materials, and the like on
the streets, sidewalks, and other thoroughfares, and see that a safe passage is
made for public travel. Where the street has become blocked with vehicles, an
officer shall assist the drivers in disentangling them and open the way for
pedestrians. When necessary, an officer shall assist persons in crossing the
street.
      (10)   Give assistance for the protection of persons and property near
his own beat if called for in any case requiring immediate attention. Having
performed that duty, he shall return as soon as possible to his own beat.
      (11)   Upon hearing the cry of "help" or other call for assistance from
anyone, whether on or off his beat, promptly proceed to render aid with all
possible dispatch.
      (12)   When stopped or delayed upon his regular patrol by any special
cause requiring him to remain at any particular place, notify his commanding
officer that there was proper cause for so remaining.
      (13)   Pay particular attention to all accidents coming under his
observation, using every means in his power, regardless of time and cost, to
relieve any person that may be injured, strictly following the rules prescribed
in the manual.
      (14)   Whenever he finds any person in distress or any person is so
reported, make an investigation, and if found correct, take those measures as
are urgently required and at once report to the officer in charge at the
station, giving the name and address of the person. The commanding officer, in
receipt of this report, shall forward the same to the Chief of Police, giving
the name of persons, number of children (if any), place of residence, name of
the reporting patrol officer, number of district, and beat. The Chief of Police
shall forward the report to the Department of Public Welfare.
      (15)   Note all cases of fast or reckless driving, brutality to animals,
vehicles left unattended, and be vigilant in seeing that the rules,
regulations, and ordinances governing traffic on the streets and sidewalks are
enforced and obeyed.
      (16)   When a disturbance occurs, instantly proceed to the spot and use
his best efforts to restore quiet. If any person has committed a felonious
assault or any other felonious crime, or by loud outcries or otherwise persists
in disturbing the peace, the person offending shall be taken into custody and
conveyed to the station house. If the patrol officer is opposed in the
performance of his duty and no other police officer is within call, he may, in
the name of the state, demand the aid of a citizen present.
      (17)   Preserve the quiet of the Sabbath, observing and reporting all
infractions of the laws governing Sunday. All churches being public places and
necessarily under police supervision, he shall arrest any person who willfully
disturbs or disquiets a congregation or assembly met for religious worship,
whether in a building or open air, by making any noise, or by rude and indecent
behavior, or profane discourse, either in a place of worship, or so near the
same as to disturb the order and solemnity of the meeting.
      (18)   Prevent at all times all unnecessary noise, especially at night.
      (19)   When any person begs on the street or goes from door to door
soliciting alms, inquire the name and abode of that person.
      (20)   Take note of all cases of contagious disease or sudden death where
there is reasonable ground to suspect criminality. An officer shall render
immediate aid in case of accident or illness in the streets, ascertaining the
important particulars connected therewith, and promptly make report thereof.
      (21)   Where buildings are in the course of construction, see that the
necessary building and street permits are obtained, and that the requisite
number of safety lights are placed on obstructions on the public thoroughfares.
      (22)   See that obscene and offensive words written on fences or walls
that can be seen from the streets are effaced.
      (23)   Examine, as soon after dark as possible, all doors, windows, or
other accessible entrances to stores, warehouses, factories, or other business
houses and vacant dwellings to see that they are secure. If found otherwise, he
shall notify the occupant, if present; if the occupant is not present, the
officer shall secure the place and notify his superior officer.
      (24)   See that the street lamps are in order and lighted at proper
times, and make immediate report of any outage.
      (25)   See that all forms of crime are prevented or the offenders
arrested, and that all other matters affecting the health, safety, or
convenience of the citizens and interests of the city receive careful
attention.
      (26)   Be vigilant in preventing fire and waste of water; call the
attention of citizens to the state of their sidewalks where, by snow, ice, or
other cause they are rendered dangerous or impassable, or when used for
exhibiting articles or goods, or have signs in violation of the city ordinance.
The police are the center of the emergency/natural gas plan and are responsible
for knowledge of it.
      (27)   See that the sidewalks or streets are not littered by sweepings or
papers from buildings or stores. Where the laws and ordinances, orders, rules,
and regulations for the government of such cases, upon notice given, are not
promptly obeyed, the patrol officer shall do what he can to make the way safe
and convenient, ascertain the names of the persons offending, and report the
same for complaint and prosecution.
      (28)   See that all receptacles for garbage, ashes, and rubbish are of
proper type and are kept securely covered and advise if they need emptying.
      (29)   Without intruding on the privacy of individuals, note all removals
from or into the limits of his beat, and acquire such a knowledge of the
inhabitants as will enable him to recognize them. It is absolutely necessary
that he become thoroughly conversant with the streets and houses within the
limits of his beat.
      (30)   Closely watch the conduct of all persons of known bad character,
fixing in his mind such impression as will enable him to recognize them when he
meets them at night in the streets. He shall note their movements and the
premises they enter, learn their names, residences, occupations, and
associates.
      (31)   Furnish such information and render such aid to all persons when
requested as is consistent with his duty.
      (32)   Note particularly all persons and vehicles which in any manner
excite suspicion. He shall note the license numbers of automobiles that pass
through his beat if under suspicious circumstances and make a memorandum of
same. He shall note all junk shops, secondhand shops, pawnshops, places of
amusement, and all licensed persons.
      (33)   Suppress all illegal sales of intoxicating liquor, and see that
the laws and ordinances involving the sale and possession of intoxicating
liquor are enforced.
      (34)   Note all suspected gambling houses, prizefighting places, fake
auction rooms, vendors of lottery and policy tickets, and houses of assignation
and i11-fame. The officer shall keep a list thereof in his book for reference,
shall suppress them and report the same to the officer in charge of his
district, and shall make periodic reports thereafter.
      (35)   Cause all children who have strayed or infants who have been
abandoned to be taken to the residence of their parents, if known and within
the bounds of his beat, or if not, to the station house.
      (36)   Exert every effort within his ability and power to assist the
Police Chief in curbing juvenile delinquency and carrying out the program of
crime prevention as promulgated by the Police Chief.
      (37)   Not enter any house or office, or enclosures of any kind except in
the line of duty, and when so doing he shall satisfy his superior officer with
sufficient cause for such apparent dereliction.
      (38)   Direct strangers and others, when requested, the nearest and
safest way to their place of destination, and when necessary, cause them to be
accompanied there by one of the police officers. He shall not leave his beat
for that purpose, but shall pass such person from his beat to the next.
      (39)   Be held responsible for the condition of his beat. Any failure to
detect crime committed during his turn of patrol duty, or the frequent
occurrence of disorder on his beat, without prompt arrest or grounds for
attributing negligence to him, and it shall be the duty of the commanding
officer to prefer charges unless the police officer shall be able to prove that
such a state of affairs has arisen from causes beyond his control.
      (40)   By his diligence render it extremely difficult for anyone to
commit a crime on his beat, remembering that the patrol officer who keeps his
beat free from crime and disorder deserves more credit than an officer who
counts the number of arrests and convictions he has obtained for offenses
committed within it.
      (41)   When crimes or incidents occur on his beat that require police
attention, make a report in writing to his superior officer as soon as
practicable. All reports shall be made on the proper forms containing all the
information therein requested and whatever other information the patrol officer
may deem advisable in the investigation of the crime or incident.
         (a)   The police officer shall obtain for the reports an accurate and
complete description of the crime, incident, property stolen or recovered,
persons wanted, and so forth. He shall use as a guide the form prescribed by
state statutes and by the Commonwealth for the reporting of crimes.
         (b)   All accident reports, whenever possible, shall be completed at
the scene of the accident before leaving.
      (42)   Before leaving his beat or district to come to the police station,
ask for and receive the permission of his supervisor. Any Police Department
employee, when going off duty, shall impart all information pertaining to
police business to his relieving partner, so that a perfect understanding shall
be had in regard to the management of the several units.
      (43)   Obey his superior officers, direct his subordinate officers in a
reasonable manner, and report to the City Manager any failure to perform duties
and orders on the part of any Police Department employee. He shall implicitly
obey and respect his superiors in all matters pertaining to police business.
      (44)   Be courteous and considerate of his associates, guarding himself
against envy, jealousy, or other unfriendly feeling, and refraining from all
communications to their discredit except to his superior officer, to whom it is
his duty to inform of any neglect or disobedience of orders on their part that
may come to his knowledge.
      (45)   Appear in court promptly at the hour specified, and when called
upon to testify in any case, give his testimony in a quiet, unassuming manner,
but in a tone of voice sufficiently loud to be plainly heard by the court or
jury. He will be explicit, but as concise as possible, confining himself
strictly and solely to the facts in the case and avoiding any exaggeration.
      (46)   Report for gymnasium, parades, target practice, school of
instruction, inspection, mental and physical examination, and other exercises
and meetings as may be ordered by the Chief of Police.
         (a)   Excuses from drill, parade, target practice, gymnasium exercise,
school of instruction, inspection, or any mental or manual examination must be
filed with the Chief of Police on or before the first day of each month for any
absence occurring during the previous month.
         (b)   If the absence is due to disability caused by sickness or
injury, the excuse must be signed by a physician. If for any other cause, the
excuse must be made out on the regular form for that purpose, giving in detail
the exact cause of the absence. If the absence is due to attending court, the
name of the prisoner and the charge against him must be given.
   (B)   Criminal laws and ordinances are those providing a penalty of death,
fine, or imprisonment for violation thereof. Those offenses providing a penalty
of death, imprisonment for at least one year in the custody of the corrections
cabinet, or fines are felonies. Misdemeanors are those offenses other than
traffic infractions, for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment of not more
than 12 months or a fine may be imposed. Violations are those offenses which
may be punished by fine only.
   (C)   If a police officer immediately pursues a person who has committed a
felony or one who is reasonably suspected of having committed a felony, it is
his duty to follow the criminal wherever he may go. If the criminal takes
refuge in any house or building, the police officer, after stating his office
and object, demanding admission and admission being refused, or if there is no
one present of whom to make such demand, may forcibly open the outer door or
windows, enter the house or building and arrest the offender. Having obtained
entrance in this or any other manner, he may forcibly open an inner door in
order to effect the arrest of the person of whom he is in pursuit. Forcibly
opening an outer door is generally a violent and dangerous proceeding, and
should never be resorted to except in extreme cases when an immediate arrest is
necessary.
   (D)   A police officer may also examine any person whom he shall see walking
abroad in the night whom he shall have reason to suspect of any unlawful
design, and may demand of him his business abroad at such time and where he is
going. This authority must be exercised with great caution. He shall write down
the license number of all motor vehicles parked at late hours of the night and
shall investigate in the vicinity when such parking is associated with other
suspicious circumstances, as most burglaries and other crimes are committed by
persons having motor vehicles for a getaway. When necessary, owners' names
shall be secured from lists of licenses.
   (E)   The following types of behavior are suspicious, and should give rise
in a diligent officer to further notice and observation, though not necessarily
an arrest. Police officers should always be aware that they must have
reasonable ground for any interference with the freedom of movement or liberty
of any citizen, and that most of the grounds stated in this division are not
necessarily a reason to arrest or stop a citizen.
      (1)   Having in possession any implements that might be used for house-
breaking or burglary under any circumstances that give just cause to suspect
that a person is about to use them for such purpose.
      (2)   Threatening in the presence of a police officer the life of any
person or threatening to commit a felony.
      (3)   Being armed with an offensive weapon with intent therewith to
commit a felony.
      (4)   Being found in any building, whether inhabited or not, or in an
enclosed yard, garden, or area under such circumstances as to give cause to
suspect any felonious purpose.
      (5)   Associating with those known to be thieves, but in this case a
police officer must use discretion, remembering that a mere association with
thieves is no ground for arrest.
      (6)   Attempting to break into a house, or examining doors and windows.
      (7)   Sitting in parked motor vehicles late at night or at places where
no reason can be given for so doing. Parking a motor vehicle late at night as
above and prowling through the neighborhood without good reason.
      (8)   Carrying or in any manner conveying goods under circumstances
indicating theft, especially in the night season.
      (9)   Being of known bad character and accompanying strangers or
intoxicated people.
      (10)   Passing through unfrequented streets, evidently avoiding being
seen or heard, the lounging about or remaining at any fixed place whistling,
coughing, or making noise, evidently acting as a guide to the criminal
operations of others.
      (11)   Being charged by another of having committed a felony.
      (12)   Being suspected of having committed a felony.
(Ord. 320.2B, passed 11-6-81)
§ 34.06 ARRESTS.
   (A)   When called upon to make an arrest, a police officer shall do so as
quietly as the circumstances permit. An arrest can be lawfully made on view,
that is to say, where the police officer finds a person in the act of
committing a violation of law; on information from someone whom the police
officer knows to be reliable, in which event the informant will accompany the
police officer to a judge to obtain a warrant; or on a warrant, capias, or
other document issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (B)   An arrest is legally completed when the police officer places his hand
on the person to be arrested and says "You are my prisoner" or some similar
expression indicating to that person that he is a prisoner, for instance, "You
are under arrest."
   (C)   If resistance is offered, the police officer is justified in meeting
force with force fully sufficient to overcome the resistance and secure his
prisoner. Any abuse of prisoners while in custody, either by word or act, will
be severely punished.
   (D)   Unless the arrest is made in close proximity to a station house, the
prisoner must be taken to the station in a patrol car. The driver must be
informed of the nature of the charge, and the arresting police officer shall
proceed to patrol his beat, unless it is necessary for him to assist in
conveying the prisoner or prisoners to the station house.
(Ord. 320.2B, passed 11-6-81)
§ 34.07 USE OF FORCE.
   (A)   A police officer is justified in using his baton as a means of self-
defense when he is assaulted by one or more persons of physical strength
superior to himself, and then only to protect himself from injury or where
there is danger of his being overpowered and losing his prisoner.
   (B)   He is justified in using his revolver in defense of his own or
another's life when attacked with a deadly weapon, or in active pursuit of an
escaping criminal charged with a felony who cannot be apprehended in any other
manner.
(Ord. 320.2B, passed 11-6-81)
§ 34.08 RIDING IN POLICE VEHICLES.
   No police officer shall take on or in or allow anyone to ride with him in

Mayor, any prisoner, or members of the police force detailed for the purpose,
or, when assistance is actually needed in responding to an emergency call, or
with permission of his superior officer.

festival, raffle, membership drive, or any like scheme, nor take any part in
promoting any such affair or scheme.
   (H)   A member of the Police Department shall not ask for a pass to any

§ 34.48 FIREFIGHTERS; POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (A)   A firefighter is a person duly qualified, appointed, and sworn to
protect life and property from damage and destruction by fire and natural
calamity. His general duties are to protect life and property, prevent and

to fire business. The members of the Fire Department are expected to obey and
shall take orders from all superior officers.
      (3)   Be courteous to and considerate of his associates, guarding himself

observe state laws and city ordinances, assist in necessary traffic matters,

      (7)   Direct strangers and others, when requested, the nearest and safest
way to their place of destination.
      (8)   Be held responsible for the performance of his duties. Any

unless he shall be able to prove that the state of affairs has arisen from
causes beyond the firefighter's control.
      (9)   Exert every effort within his power to curb fires and carry out
plans for fire prevention. He shall be vigilant in preventing fire and waste of

duties, neither neglecting friendliness nor wasting time in unnecessary
conversation. In dealing with the public, he shall be kind and courteous, but
firm and decided. A member, when on duty, shall assume a military bearing and
avoid careless loungings or undignified attitude.
      (12)   Acquire, as quickly as possible, a thorough knowledge of the
streets and hydrant locations so as to enable him to recognize and find them.
It is absolutely necessary that he become thoroughly conversant with the
streets, houses, and hydrant locations throughout the city.
      (13)   Not refuse to give assistance for the protection of persons and
property. He shall, if he hears the cry of "help" or other call for assistance
from anyone, promptly proceed to render aid with all possible dispatch.
Whenever he finds any person in distress or any person is so reported, he shall
take those measures as are urgently required and at once report to the officer
in charge at the police station, giving the name and address of the person or
persons in distress. The commanding officer in receipt of this report shall
forward the same to the Chief of Police, giving the name of the person, number
of children (if any), place of residence, name of the reporting person, number
of district, and beat. The Chief of Police shall forward the report to the
Department of Public Welfare.

observation, using every means in his power (regardless of time and cost) to
relieve any persons that may be injured and strictly following the rules
prescribed in the manual.
      (15)   Furnish that information and render that aid to all persons when
requested as is consistent with his duty.

there is reasonable ground to suspect criminality and render immediate aid in
case of accident or illness in the streets, ascertaining the important
particulars connected therewith and promptly making report thereof.

upon to testify in any case, give his testimony in a quiet, unassuming manner,

strictly and solely to the facts in the case and avoiding any exaggeration.
      (18)   Report for gymnasium, parades, target practice, school of
instruction, inspection, mental and physical examination, and other exercises
and meetings as may be ordered by the Fire Chief. Excuses from drill, parade,
target practice, gymnasium exercise, school of instruction, inspection, or any
mental or manual examination must be filed with the Fire Chief on or before the
first day of each month for any absence during the previous month. If any
absence is due to disability caused by sickness or injury, the excuse must be
signed by a physician. If an absence is for any other cause, the excuse must be
made out on the regular form for that purpose and give in detail the exact
cause of the absence. If the absence is due to attending court, the name of the
prisoner and the charge against him must be given.

investigated and a written report prepared and delivered to the City Manager
immediately:
      (1)   If an accident occurs involving a firefighter.

costs incurred in the court where the suit is pending shall pay to the city and
the city shall account to the clerk of the court in which the suit is filed for
the costs so collected.

terms hereof shall be deposited in the general fund of the City of Hazard, and

   (A)   Any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of the city
shall make a request for inspection at the office of the City Clerk during
regular office hours, except during legal holidays. The official custodian or
the custodian acting under the authority of the official custodian, may require
a request to inspect public records to be in writing, signed by the applicant
and with the applicant's name printed legibly on the application. A written
request to inspect public records may be presented by hand delivery, mail or
via facsimile, if one is available.
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person's request is in compliance
with this chapter and the open records law, and the requested public records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the public records for
inspection. A person may inspect public records at the designated office of the
city during the regular office hours, or in appropriate cases, by receiving
copies of the records through the mail.
   (C)   If the public records are to be inspected at the offices of the city,
suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk or
in another office of the city as determined by the official custodian or
custodian for the inspection. No person shall remove original copies of public
records from the offices of the city without written permission of the official
custodian of the record. When public records are inspected at the city offices,
the person inspecting the records shall have the right to make abstracts and
memoranda of the public records and to obtain copies of all written public
records. When copies are requested, the custodian may require advance payment
of the prescribed fee.
   (D)   Upon proper request, the city shall mail copies of the public records
to a person whose residence or principal place of business is located outside

readily available and after the person pays in advance the prescribed fee.

holidays) from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the
cause is given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on
which the public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 38.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies thereof. However, refusal under this section must be sustained by
clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 38.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and

five-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific

custodian may require a written request and advance payment of the prescribed
fee, including postage where appropriate. If the applicant desires copies of
public records other than written records, the custodian of the records shall
duplicate the records or permit the applicant to duplicate the records;
however, the custodian shall ensure that such duplication will not damage or
alter the original records.

electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public record may be provided in

agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.

of an individual or a group, the public agency may at its discretion provide
the requested format and recover staff costs as well as any actual costs
incurred.
   (B)   (1)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee.

§ 39.02 FINDINGS.
   The City Commission finds and declares that:
   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of this city depends upon
the public's confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers
and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the private
interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled.
   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
(Ord. 95-1, passed 12-5-94)
§ 39.03 PURPOSE; AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring that
standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for officers
and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in their
application, and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
House Bill 875, as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of House Bill 875.

§ 50.01 DUE DATE; DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   (A)   All utility bills are due on the fifteenth day of each month. Upon
failure to pay any bill by the twenty-fifth day of each month, service will be
discontinued in accordance with the following policy.
      (1)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills.
      (2)   The city shall give notice of discontinuance of service to the
affected customer and to other persons who are aggrieved by discontinuance of
such utility service and who have requested such notice in writing. An
“AGGRIEVED PERSON” for the purposes of this section shall be defined as a
customer, tenant, or licensee having a valid and existing proprietary,
leasehold, license or other possessory interest in the property who has
contracted for utility services or otherwise complied with the requirements of
this section pertaining to the giving of notice. The burden of proof shall be
upon the aggrieved person to demonstrate the existence of his or her valid
possessory interest in the premises; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall authorize or obligate the city to adjudicate or otherwise
determine the validity of any property rights.
      (3)   Any person who may be aggrieved by the discontinuance of utility
service to a customer may request duplicate copies of any notice of
discontinuance by written notification to the billing clerk responsible for
utility services at city hall specifying the name and address for the giving of
such notice.
      (4)   (a)   The regular monthly bill shall contain the notice required
pursuant to this section and shall also contain, in addition to the title,
address, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
            1.   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill; and
            2.   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, service
will be discontinued for nonpayment; and
            3.   That any customer or other aggrieved person disputing the
correctness of his bill shall have a right to a hearing pursuant to this
section if requested within ten days in writing.
         (b)   No other past due notice will be sent to delinquent customers.
      (5)   In the event any customer or other aggrieved person disputing the
correctness of the bill requests a hearing, a hearing shall be scheduled as
soon as reasonably practical and, in any event, prior to discontinuance of
service. Any customer or other aggrieved person may be represented in person
and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may present
orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city official
in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to order that
the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make
a final determination of the customer’s complaint. Requests for delays or
waiver of payment will not be entertained except as may be required under
applicable federal or state laws; only questions of proper and correct billing
will be considered at the hearing.
   (B)   In the absence of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the
hearing procedure provided herein, service will be discontinued at the time
specified. If service is discontinued under division (A) of this section, a $75
reconnection fee shall be paid before service will be reinstated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no application for new service or reconnection
of utility services shall be granted in circumstances in which the applicant is
seeking to circumvent or avoid a lawful discontinuance of utility services.
Without limiting the foregoing, no other member, or resident or other occupant
of a household whose utility services have been disconnected shall be eligible
to apply for reconnection of utility service so long as the customer whose
service has been discontinued continues to reside in or occupy the premises for
which utility services is sought.
   (C)   Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the termination of
utility services with or without a hearing in the interest of public health or
safety or to prevent injury to persons or property or as otherwise allowed or
required by law. Any customer or other aggrieved person whose utility services
have been disconnected under this section without benefit of a pre-termination
hearing shall be entitled to a post-termination hearing within five days
following disconnection of such services if requested in writing.
   (D)   A late payment penalty of 10% of the sewer use charge will be added to
each delinquent bill for each 30 days or portions thereof, of delinquency in
addition to the reconnection fee.
   (E)   Any person who reconnects or causes to have reconnected any water
meter that has been disconnected for nonpayment or any other reason without
permission from the City Clerk shall be charged a $50 fee in addition to the
$75 reconnection fee and may be subjected to criminal charges.

unanticipated costs of the city in delivery of natural gas and, without
limitation, will generate sufficient revenue for any personnel, maintenance,
reserves, depreciation, overhead, capital improvements, bond or other debt
service, and any other usual and customary operations and maintenance expenses
of either public or private utilities to the extent permitted by law. It may
include amounts reasonably calculated to promote economic development or to
fund other projects or general program expenses should surplus funds from gas

city from time to time. The ADD ON RATE may be changed only by affirmative vote
of the City Commission from time to time.
   "COAL FIELDS REGIONAL INDUSTRIAL PARK PIPELINE." That certain pipeline
constructed by the city which is segregated from the remainder of the city's
gas works and which serves the area of the Coal Fields Regional Industrial Park
and contiguous or nearby properties in close proximity to the pipeline, if any,
which may be opened for gas sales in the future discretion of the City Manager
with oversight of the City Commission.
   "COMMERCIAL GAS." Natural gas used by non-manufacturing establishments or
agencies primarily engaged in the sale of goods or services. Included, without
limitation, are such establishments as hotels, restaurants, wholesale and
retail stores and other service enterprises; gas used by local, state, and

with all sources of supply. For the customers of the Coal Fields Regional
Industrial Park Pipeline, the GCR shall be based upon the sole source contract
for supply of natural gas to the pipeline but may also include any other direct
or indirect costs relating to the provision of gas, including but not limited

      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum monthly charge or bill
for use of wastewater treatment facilities shall be $9.28 effective January 1,
2017, $9.49 effective February 1, 2020, $9.62 effective February 1, 2021, $9.91
effective February 1, 2022, and $10.41 effective February 1, 2023, and $10.76
effective February 1, 2024 regardless of metered or estimated consumption of
water.
      (3)   Commencing effective on July 1, 2017, and in each year thereafter,
the prevailing rate for OM&R may be automatically adjusted annually for
increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U); U.S.
City Average; all items, not seasonally adjusted, 1982-1984=100 reference base,
and the new effective rate shall be incorporated into the budget ordinance for
each successive year. If there is a decrease or no change in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI-U), then there will be no change in sewer rates for that year.
      (4)   User charge rates for customers of Perry County Sanitation District
No. 1 or, if applicable, for other governmental units with contracts for
collection and/or processing of sewage as may now exist or be executed in the
future, shall be governed by the provisions of the individual or respective
agreements.
   (B)   For those users whose wastewater has a greater strength than normal
domestic wastewater, approval of the City Manager or Superintendent of Public
Works prior to any discharge, and a surcharge in addition to the normal user
charge, will be collected. A surcharge rate of $.24 per pound of excessive BOD
or suspended solids shall be charged based upon the following formula:
   SURCHARGE FORMULA
      A (D-300) + B(E-300) + C(F-30) x .0024 x G = Surcharge Payment ($/Mo.)
Where the formula components are as follows:
A.   Surcharge rate for BOD, in $.24/pound.
B.   Surcharge rate for SS, in $.24/pound.
C.   Surcharge rate for Ammonia-Nitrogen, in $.06/pound.
D.   User’s average BOD concentration, in mg/l.
E.   User’s average SS concentration, in mg/l.
F.   User’s average Ammonia-Nitrogen concentration, in mg/l.
G.   User’s monthly flow to wastewater works, per 1,000 gallons.
No reduction in wastewater service charges, fees, or taxes shall be permitted
because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the wastewater works
contain less than 300 mg/l of BOD or 300 mg/l of suspended solids or 30 mg/l of
ammonia-nitrogen.
   (C)   The city shall maintain financial records to accurately account for
revenues generated by the treatment system and expenditures for operation and
maintenance of the system, including normal replacement costs.
   (D)   The city shall review not less often than annually the wastewater
contribution of users, the total cost of OM & R of the wastewater works, debt
service obligations, and user charge rates. Based on such review, the city
shall revise, when necessary, the schedule of user charge rates to accomplish
the following:
      (1)   Maintain an equitable distribution of OM & R costs among users of
the treatment system; and
      (2)   Generate sufficient revenues to offset costs associated with the
proper operation and maintenance of the wastewater system and to meet debt
service requirements; and
      (3)   Maintain surcharge rates for excessive strength and toxicity
discharges to reflect current treatment and monitoring costs associated
therewith.
Each user of the wastewater system shall be notified, at least annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill of the rate and that portion of the total
charge which is attributable to OM & R of the wastewater system.
   (E)   All users shall be billed monthly. Billings for any particular month
shall be made within ten days after the end of the month and collections and
discontinuance of service shall be governed by the provisions of §
50.01.
   (F)   The revenues collected as a result of the user charges levied shall be
deposited in a separate non-lapsing fund known as the Operation, Maintenance
and Replacement Fund. Fiscal year-end balances in the Fund shall be used for no
other purposes than those designated. Monies which have been transferred from
other sources to meet temporary shortages in the Fund shall be returned to
their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of the user charge rates
for operation, maintenance and replacement. The user charge rate shall be
adjusted such that the transferred monies will be returned to their respective
accounts within six months of the fiscal year in which the monies were
borrowed.

served by the city water system and that adoption of this subchapter is
necessary to ensure continuity of water supplies during periods of water
shortage.
   (B)   Water shortage. Whenever the City Commission finds that a shortage of
water supply needed for essential uses exists, it shall be empowered to declare
by resolution that a water shortage exists, and that it will encourage
voluntary water conservation or impose mandatory restrictions on water use
during the period of the shortage. Such a shortage shall be deemed to continue
until it is declared by resolution of the City Commission to have ended. The
resolution shall be published in the official city newspaper and through the
general news media or any other appropriate method for making such resolutions
public.
   (C)   Water emergencies. Whenever the Mayor or City Manager finds that a
shortage of water supply needed for essential uses exists, that such a shortage
is acute and that the delay required to convene for an emergency meeting of the
City Commission would further endanger existing water supplies and constitute a
threat to public health and safety, the Mayor or City Manager shall be
empowered to declare that a water emergency exists and impose those voluntary
or mandatory restrictions set forth below on water use pending a formal
declaration of shortage by the City Commission. As soon thereafter as is
practicable, either the Mayor or a majority of the City Commission shall call a
special meeting of the City Commission to consider ratification or modification
of the conservation measures imposed. The Mayor or the City Manager shall
notify the individual members of the City Commission of the shortage in advance
of the declaration whenever possible, and the declaration of emergency by the
Mayor or City Manager shall thereafter be published to the general news media
so as to inform the public of the shortage and the necessary conservation
measures as soon as possible.
   (D)   Planned service interruptions. Whenever it is necessary to implement a
service interruption to a significant portion of the water system for purposes
of planned maintenance or system repair, the City Manager is hereby authorized
to impose conservation measures, including but not limited to those voluntary
or mandatory measures set forth in §§
54.16 and
54.17, and shall provide such notice to the affected customers as is
practicable under the circumstances and in accordance with the provisions of
54.18.

§ 54.17 MANDATORY CONSERVATION MEASURES.
   Upon the declaration of a water supply shortage or emergency or planned
service interruption as provided in §
54.15, the Mayor or the City Manager is authorized to implement certain
mandatory water conservation measures to prohibit the following uses of water
which are deemed nonessential:
   (A)   The use of any water for watering lawns;

municipality, contractors or any person for any purpose, except:
      (1)   Firefighting; or
      (2)   Health protection purposes specifically approved by the health
officials of the municipality;

      (3)   Refilling specifically approved by the municipal health officials
or other designated municipal officer where the system has been drained for
health protection or repair purposes.
   (L)   Failure to comply with the mandatory conservation measures set forth
in this section shall constitute a violation of §
54.99, and each day shall constitute a separate violation.
(Ord. 94-4, passed 3-7-94; Am. Ord. 2021-10, passed 12-21-20)
§ 54.18 PLANNED SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS.
   (A)   In order to further effectuate compliance with this subchapter and to
achieve its intended results, the Mayor and City Manager are hereby authorized

part of the city water supply system, as may be deemed appropriate, when any
and/or all of the following conditions are determined to exist:
      (1)   Voluntary conservation measures have not achieved or resulted in a
significant reduction in system-wide usage as determined by the Mayor or City
Manager;
      (2)   Mandatory conservation measures have not achieved or resulted in a
significant reduction in system-wide water usage as determined by the Mayor or
City Manager;
      (3)   Temporary service interruptions are necessary in order to further
extend limited and/or dwindling water supplies; or
      (4)   Maintenance or repair to the system requires that service to any
significant portion of the system be disrupted or interrupted for the time
period necessary to perform such maintenance or repair.
   (B)   In the event that it is determined that planned service interruptions
are necessary, the city shall give its customers through the public media

be imposed on the entire system, or a part thereof, and, if only part of the
system will experience planned, temporary service interruptions, identify the
geographical boundaries within which the planned, temporary service
interruptions will occur; and
      (4)   Advise all customers within the areas affected by planned,
temporary service interruptions how to treat any water received from the system
for human consumption, during the period of planned, temporary service
interruptions and for such additional time as may be necessary until full
pressure is restored to the system.
   (C)   If the planned, temporary service interruption is imposed as
authorized and required by this section, priority will be given to the
continued delivery of water to health care facilities, schools and other public
institutions within the area affected by such interruptions, by means of any
adequate, alternative delivery measures which may be available.

§ 54.32 TERMINATION FEE.
   A $50 charge shall be assessed when a city representative makes a trip to
the premises of a customer for the purpose of terminating service. The charge
shall be assessed if the city representative actually terminates service or if,
in the course of the trip, the customer pays the delinquent bill to avoid
termination. The city shall make a termination fee only once in any billing
period. Any disconnection or reconnection as a result of non-payment of service
that requires the city to take extraordinary means to perform said
disconnection/reconnection (i.e. digging up and re-paving of blacktop) shall be
charged to the customer at actual cost.

apply. Any customer who cannot be available at their address during the time
the city arrives to reconnect service, and happens to leave a plumbing fixture
open or there is a large leak, the city reserves the right not to activate
service at that time to avoid damage to the customer’s property or incurring a
large water bill. Should the city choose to turn on the service in this
situation the city shall not be held responsible for any damage to the
customer’s property as a result of turning on the service. Additional service
calls back to a customer’s address may result in an additional turn-on fee.

   (A)   Any city, county, urban-county, charter county, fire protection
district, or volunteer fire protection district ("user") may withdraw water
from the utility's water distribution system for fighting fires or training
firefighters at no charge on the condition that it maintains estimates of the
amount of water used for fire protection and training during the calendar month
and reports the amount of this water usage to the utility no later than the 8th
day of the following calendar month. Any user that withdraws water from the
utility's water distribution system for fire protection or training purposes
and fails to submit the required report on water usage in a timely manner shall
be assessed the cost of this water. A user shall submit a monthly report even
if it withdraws no water for fire protection or training purposes.
   (B)   A non-reporting user's usage shall be presumed to be 0.3% of the
utility's total water sales for the calendar month. A non-reporting user may
present evidence of its actual usage to rebut the presumed usage. The utility
shall consider this evidence and shall adjust the presumed usage amount
accordingly. The non-reporting user shall be billed for this usage at the
lowest usage block rate regardless of customer classification that the utility
charges. A non-reporting user shall also be assessed a penalty of $25 for each
failure to submit a report in a timely manner.

hereof, where a different fine is not provided by law, shall be fined in an
amount not exceeding $500 for each violation. Each violation shall be
considered a separate offense. Violation of this chapter shall constitute a
civil offense which shall be enforced according to the procedures set forth in

TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES
§ 70.15 SIGNAL LEGENDS.
   Whenever traffic is regulated or controlled exclusively by a traffic-control
sign or signs exhibiting the words "Go," "Caution," or "Stop," or exhibiting
different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows:
   (A)   Green alone or "Go": Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green or
"Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop": Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not again proceed
until it can do so without danger.
   (E)   Flashing amber alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall reduce
its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection controlled by such
signal.
   (F)   "Yield Right-of-Way": Vehicular traffic facing the "Yield Right-of-
Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a "Yield Right-of-Way"
sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a speed in excess
of 15 miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not apply to vehicles
entering an expressway.
   (G)   Lane lights: When lane lights are installed over any street for the
purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing amber lights appear above a lane all left turns shall be made from
that lane. Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles shall not move
against them. If flashing amber lights show above a lane, that lane shall be
used only for passing and for left turns unless a sign at such place prohibits
such turn.
Penalty, see §
70.99

of the public departments or public utilities of the city, or any electric
signal, gate, or watchman at railroad crossings, unless otherwise directed by a
police officer. However, the type and the right to or necessity for such
barrier or sign must be approved by the city.
   (B)   Such sign, signal, marking, or barrier shall have the same authority
as the personal direction of a police officer.
Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.18 INTERFERENCE WITH SIGNALS.
   No person shall without authority attempt to or in fact alter, deface,
injure, knock down, or remove any official control device or any railroad sign
or signal, or any inscription, shield, or insignia thereon, or any part
thereof.
Penalty see §
70.99
§ 70.19 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNALS OR MARKINGS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to place, maintain, or display on
or in view of any street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the
movement of traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or interferes with
the effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or
signal. No person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority
permit on any street, any traffic sign or signal bearing any commercial
advertising. Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting any
public department or public utility of the city in any emergency or temporarily
from marking or erecting any traffic barrier or sign whose placing has been
approved by the city.
   (B)   Every such prohibited sign, signal, or marking is declared to be a
public nuisance and the city is empowered forthwith to remove it or cause it to
be removed.
Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.20 DEVICE TO BE LEGIBLE AND IN PROPER POSITION.
   No provision of this traffic code for which signs or any other traffic-
control device is required shall be enforceable against an alleged violator if
at the time and place of the alleged violation the required device was not in
proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant
person.
§ 70.21 TEMPORARY DISREGARD OF DEVICES BY POLICE OFFICERS.
   In an emergency any police officer may at his discretion disregard traffic-
control lights or signals or established regulations in order to facilitate the
movement of traffic.
§ 70.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Any person who violates any provision of this traffic code where no other
penalty is specifically provided shall be guilty of a violation. The penalty
for violations of this traffic code shall be as set forth in § 99.18 of the
Hazard Code Enforcement Board Ordinance. Violation of this traffic code shall
constitute a civil offense which shall be enforced according to the procedures
set forth in the Hazard Code Enforcement Board Ordinance by the Code

importance to the movement of traffic shall be marked in a distinctive manner
in order to indicate its importance. Should the operator of any vehicle enter
any intersection so marked when there is insufficient room on the other side of
the intersection to accommodate the vehicle, the indication of any traffic-
control signal notwithstanding, he shall be deemed to have violated this
division rather than division (B) above.
Penalty, see §
71.99

§ 71.10 OVERTAKING VEHICLES.
   (A)   Vehicles overtaking other vehicles proceeding in the same direction
shall pass to the left of them and shall not again drive to the right until

either to the right or left when so directed by a police officer, when on a
one-way street or where the location of the tracks prevents compliance with
this section, with regard for other traffic.
   (B)   (1)   Vehicles overtaking a bicycle or electric low-speed scooter
proceeding in the same direction shall:
         (a)   If there is more than one lane for traffic proceeding in the
same direction, move the vehicle to the immediate left, if the lane is
available and moving in the lane is reasonably safe; or
         (b)   If there is only one lane for traffic proceeding in the same
direction, pass to the left of the bicycle or electric low-speed scooter at a
distance of not less than three feet between any
portion of the vehicle and the bicycle and maintain that distance until safely
past the overtaken bicycle or electric low-speed scooter. If space on the
roadway is not available to have a minimum distance of three feet between the
vehicle and the bicycle or electric low-speed scooter, then the driver of the
passing vehicle shall use reasonable caution in passing the bicyclist or
electric low-speed scooter operator.
      (2)   The driver of a motor vehicle may drive to the left of the center
of a roadway, including when a no-passing zone is marked in accordance with
division (F) below, to pass a person operating a bicycle or electric low-speed
scooter only if the roadway to the left of the center is unobstructed for a
sufficient distance to permit the driver to pass the person operating the
bicycle or electric low-speed scooter safely and avoid interference with
oncoming traffic. This division does not authorize driving on the left side of
the center of the roadway when otherwise prohibited under state law.
      (3)   The operator of a bicycle or electric low-speed scooter shall not
ride more than two abreast on a single highway lane unless operating on any
part of the roadway marked exclusively for bicycle use. Persons riding two
abreast shall not impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.
   (C)   The operator of a vehicle may overtake and pass upon the right of
another vehicle only under the following conditions:
      (1)   When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn;
      (2)   Upon a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for
two or more lines of vehicles moving lawfully in the direction being traveled
by the overtaking vehicle.
   (D)   The operator of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon
the right only under conditions permitting such movements in safety. Such
movement shall not be made by driving off the roadway unless passing vehicle
comes to a complete stop and such movement may be made safely.
   (E)   No vehicle shall be driven to the left side of the center of the
roadway in overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction unless the left side is clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic
for a sufficient distance ahead to permit overtaking and passing to be
completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any vehicle
approaching from the opposite direction or any vehicle overtaken. In every
event, the overtaking vehicle must return to the right-hand side of the roadway
before coming within 200 feet of any vehicle approaching from the opposite
direction.
   (F)   The Commissioner of Highways is hereby authorized to determine those
portions of any highway where overtaking and passing or driving to the left of
the roadway would be especially hazardous and may by appropriate signs or
markings on the roadway indicate the beginning and and of such zones, and when
such signs or markings are in place and clearly visible to an ordinarily
observant person, every driver of a vehicle shall obey the directions thereof,
except as provided for in division (B)(2) above.
   (G)   Whenever any roadway has been divided into three clearly marked lanes
for travel, the following additional rules shall apply:
      (1)   A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as may be practical entirely
within a single lane and shall not be moved from that lane until the driver has
first ascertained that the movement can be made with safety;
      (2)   A vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane except when
overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly visible and
the center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation
for a left turn or where a center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to
traffic moving in the direction in which the vehicle is proceeding and is
signposted to give notice of the allocation; and
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing slow-moving traffic to use
a designated lane or allocating specified lanes to traffic moving in the same
direction and operators of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.
   (H)   A vehicle shall not be driven in the left lane of any limited access
highway of four lanes or more with a posted speed limit of at least 65 miles
per hour, except in overtaking a slower vehicle, yielding to traffic coming
onto such a highway, or when traffic conditions exist which would prohibit safe
use of the right or center lanes.
   (I)   (1)   Except as provided in division (I)(3) below, the operator of a
motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable
and prudent, having regard for the speed of the vehicle
and the traffic upon and condition of the highway.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (I)(3) below, the operator of any
motor truck, semitrailer truck, bus, or heavy construction equipment unit, when
traveling upon a highway outside of a business or residential district, shall
not follow within 250 feet of another such vehicle or equipment unit. This
division shall not prevent overtaking and passing, nor shall it apply to any
lane specially designated for use of motor trucks or semitrailer trucks, buses
or heavy construction equipment units.
      (3)   Divisions (I)(1) and (2) above shall not apply to a trailing
commercial motor vehicle involved in a platoon as defined in KRS 281.010, but

highway where the operator's view is obstructed within such distance as to
create a hazard in the event another vehicle might approach from the opposite
direction;
      (2)   When approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection
or railroad grade crossing;
      (3)   When the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any
bridge, viaduct, or tunnel.
   (B)   The foregoing limitations shall not apply upon a one-way roadway, nor
when an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left of the
center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the right-of-
way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the unobstructed
portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an immediate
hazard, nor to the operator of a vehicle turning left into or from an alley,
private road, or driveway.

roadway;
      (2)   Left turns. The operator of a vehicle intending to turn left shall
approach the turn in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic
moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle. Whenever practicable the
left turn shall be made to the left of the center of the intersection and so as
to leave the intersection or other location in the extreme right-hand lane
lawfully available to traffic moving in the same direction as such vehicle on
the roadway being entered. (KRS 189.330(6))
   (B)   The transportation cabinet and local authorities in their respective
jurisdictions may cause official traffic-control devices to be placed and
thereby require and direct that a differnet course from that specified in this
section be traveled by turning vehicles and when such devices are so placed no
operator shall turn a vehicle other than as directed and required by such
devices. (KRS 189.330 (7))
   (C)   The operator of a vehicle intending to turn to the left within an
intersection or into an alley, private road, or driveway shall yield the right-
of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within
the intersection or so close thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard. (KRS

   (B)   The right-of-way rule declared in division (A) above is modified at
highways and through intersections and as otherwise stated in this traffic
code. (KRS 189.330 (2))
   (C)   Preferential right-of-way may be indicated by stop signs or yield
signs. The state highway commissioner with reference to state highways and
local authorities with reference to other highways under their jurisdiction may

of the Police Department. Should a vehicle be moved without the consent and
approval of the Police Department a warrant shall be issued immediately for the
violator's arrest.
   (C) All fines, fees, and charges, including all costs for towing, handling
and storage charges related to the transportation and impoundment of the
vehicle, must be paid in full before a release of impoundment can be issued for
the vehicle's release.
   (D)   The city may condition the release of an impounded vehicle upon the
payment of the charges imposed per division (C), unless the owner or other
person entitled to possession challenges the validity of the impoundment
pursuant to division (E) of this section. A vehicle may be released to the
owner or other person entitled to possession only upon proof of ownership or
right to possession. The city shall require reasonable security, bond or other
assurances of indemnification from a person who is not the registered owner of
the vehicle prior to releasing the vehicle to such person.
   (E)   The owner of a motor vehicle which has been impounded pursuant to this
section or other person entitled to possession, may challenge the validity of
such impoundment and request in writing a hearing before the Code Enforcement
Board by contacting the City Clerk. The hearing shall be conducted within ten
business days of the date of the request, unless the owner or other person
entitled to possession waives the limitation or the city shows good cause for
such delay. The city shall retain possession of the vehicle pending the
hearing, unless the owner or other person claiming right of possession posts a
bond in an amount equal to the fines and fees accrued as of the date of the
hearing request, or $75 whichever is less. If the owner or person claiming
possession of the vehicle is unable to pay the amount of the bond, the hearing

Enforcement Board shall determine whether the impoundment was valid and
reasonable. Where it has not been established that the impoundment was
justified, an order releasing the vehicle shall be entered. All fines and fees
paid or amounts posted as bond because of the impoundment of the vehicle shall
be returned. Where it has been established that the impoundment was justified,
the Code Enforcement Board shall uphold the impoundment and condition the
release of the vehicle upon payment of all fines and fees accruing thereto
pursuant to division (C). If bond has been posted as security for release of
the vehicle, said bond shall be forfeited to the city. Any fines or fees in
excess of the amount of the bond posted shall be ordered to be paid by the

court finds that the impoundment was justified, the owner shall be ordered to
pay all fees and fines accruing per division (C) as of the date of judgment. If
the court finds that the impoundment was not justified, the city shall be
ordered to release the vehicle, if applicable, and to return all fines and fees
paid as a result of the impoundment and the plaintiff shall be authorized to
recover his costs.

necessary that the parking of motor vehicles on snow emergency routes be
prohibited, or whenever he finds on the basis of a firm forecast of snow,

evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter without the written
consent of the persons concerned. No employee of the Chief Executive Officer

   (B)   A complaint under division (A) above shall be filed within l80 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be
in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegation of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint

at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.

Officer, the Chief Executive Officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance with this chapter, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days
thereafter, file a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing

   (D)   If the Chief Executive Officer has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance within 30 days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30
days thereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this chapter, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint.
If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such
practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
Chief Executive Officer shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain
voluntary compliance.
(Ord. 950.13, passed 11-23-83) Penalty, see §

   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the Chief Executive Officer shall have
access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals,
and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and
copy such materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such
persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation.
The Chief Executive Officer shall first comply with the provisions of the
Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The Chief
Executive Officer may issue subpoenas to compel access to or the production of
such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue
interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same
limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or
served in aid of a civil action in the United States district court for the
district in which the investigation is taking place. The Chief Executive
Officer may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the Chief Executive Officer, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the name of the Chief Executive Officer to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued by the Chief Executive Officer. Subpoenas
issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their face the name and
address of the respondent and shall state that they were issued at his request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Chief Executive Officer shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in United States district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the Chief Executive Officer to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The Chief Executive Officer shall grant the petition if it finds that
the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or
place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any
matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly
onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Chief
Executive Officer or other person at whose request it was issued may petition
for its enforcement in the state court for the district in which the person to
whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.
   (F)   No person shall willfully fail or neglect to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or other evidence,
if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the
Chief Executive Officer. No person shall, with intent thereby to mislead the
Chief Executive Officer, make or cause to be made any false entry or statement
of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted to the
Chief Executive Officer pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or willfully
neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true, and correct entries in
such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or willfully mutilate,
alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary evidence.
   (G)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the Chief
Executive Officer participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this
chapter.

91.03 through

action shall be commenced within l80 days after the alleged discriminatory
housing practice occurred; provided, however, that the court shall continue
such civil case brought pursuant to this section or §
91.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial, if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the Chief Executive Officer are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice
complained of in the complaint made to the Chief Executive Officer and which
practice forms the basis for the action in court. Any sale, encumbrance, or
rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued under the
authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fide purchaser, emcumbrancer,
or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint
or civil action under the provisions of this chapter shall not be affected.
   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of
a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the said plaintiff in the opinion of the
court is not financially able to assume the attorney's fees.

§ 99.13 LIEN; FINES, CHARGES, AND FEES.
   (A)   The city shall possess a lien on property owned by the person found by
a non-appealable final order as defined by §
99.01 of this chapter, or by a final judgment of the court, to have committed a
violation of a city ordinance. The lien shall be for all civil fines assessed
for the violation and for all charges and fees incurred by the city in
connection with the enforcement of the ordinance, including abatement costs. An
affidavit of the code enforcement officer shall constitute prima facie evidence
of the amount of the lien and regularity of the proceedings pursuant to KRS
65.8801 to 65.8839.
   (B)   The lien shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk. The lien
shall be notice to all persons from the time of its recording and shall bear
interest until paid. The lien shall continue for ten years following the date
of the non-appealable final order or final court judgment.
   (C)   Subject to §
99.15 of this chapter, the lien shall take precedence over all other liens,
except state, county, school board, and city taxes, and may be enforced by
judicial proceedings, including a foreclosure action.
   (D)   In addition to the remedy prescribed in division (A) of this section,
the person found to have committed the violation shall be personally
responsible for the amount of all civil fines assessed for the violation and
for all charges, fees and abatement costs incurred by the city in connection
with the enforcement of the ordinance. The city may bring a civil action
against the person and shall have the same remedies as provided for the
recovery of a debt.
   (E)   Abatement.
      (1)   All violations of ordinances and codes enforced under this chapter
shall be remedied by the violator within the time period specified in the
specific ordinance or code, unless the code enforcement officer determines that
a shorter time is warranted. In the absence of a specified time period, the
time period for remedy of a violation shall not exceed ten days, however the
code enforcement officer, Board or hearing officer may grant an extension of
this time period. The time period for the violation to be remedied shall not be
less than 24 hours following issuance of the citation, unless the code
enforcement officer has reason to believe that the existence of the violation
presents imminent danger, a serious threat to the public health, safety, and
welfare, or if in the absence of immediate action, the effects of the violation
will be irreparable or irreversible. The time period shall commence upon the
issuance of a citation in accordance with §
99.08(D) of this chapter.
      (2)   If the property owner so served does not abate the violation within
the applicable time period, the city may proceed to abate such violation,
keeping an account of the expense of abatement. The abatement costs, including
necessary and reasonable costs for and associated with clearing, preventing
unauthorized entry to, or demolishing all or a portion of a structure or
premises, or taking any other action with regard to a structure or premises
necessary to remedy a violation and to maintain and preserve the public health,
safety, and welfare in accordance with any local government ordinance, shall be
charged to and paid by the property owner.
      (3)   Filing of notice to contest a citation in accordance with §
99.08(F) of this chapter shall serve to toll the city's abatement of the
violation, unless the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the
existence of the violation presents imminent danger, a serious threat to the
public health, safety, and welfare, or if in the absence of immediate action,
the effects of the violation will be irreparable or irreversible. In the event
the Board or a hearing officer determines that the violation contested did
occur, the Board or hearing officer may order that the abatement proceed
immediately or within a specified time period not to exceed 30 days.
      (4)   The code official shall bill the property owner of such premises at
least once following abatement. No lien claimed shall be filed against the
property until seven days have elapsed after the bill is sent. If the property
is the subject of litigation, the lien may be filed immediately upon the
mailing of the bill.

§ 115.04 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) below, net profits shall be
apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the net profits by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) below, plus
the sales factor, described in division (C) below, and the denominator of which
is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profits by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) below.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sales, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
tune spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of gross receipts.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this division
(E), the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
“passed through” these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational

severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
division (H) unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account
for, or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes
imposed by this chapter become or became due.
   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H) of this section, every employee
receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
115.03 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee,
such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the [city,
county, school district] each quarter in the same manner as if they were the
employer.

by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns, and comply with rules as the city from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems sufficient to
determine the tax liability the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness

of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business
entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.

§ 118.01 PURPOSE.
   Recycling establishments, tow yards and mechanic centers by definition
contain items which are so visually offensive as to create a public nuisance
which inhibits tourism and potential growth and development of this community.
This chapter promotes and protects the visual aesthetic character of the land
surrounding highways to persons residing in the vicinity and persons traveling
thereon, while allowing each landowner to conduct business upon his own
property, provided such business is conducted in such a manner as not to be
injurious or offensive to others. This chapter provides an effective means, in
the public interest, of controlling the offensive unsightly characteristics of
recycling establishments, tow yards or mechanic centers without impeding the
operation of such businesses from which the nuisance originates.
(Ord. 2021-08, passed 11-16-20)
§ 118.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The operation of any new recycling establishment, tow yard or mechanic
center situated closer than 50 feet from the right-of-way line of any public
road is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.
   (B)   All recycling establishments, tow yards and mechanic centers, where
permitted, shall comply with the following provisions:
      (1)   No junked, wrecked or inoperable vehicles, machinery or material
scrap or parts shall be located on the right-of-way of any road; and
      (2)   All recycling establishments, tow yards and mechanic centers, where
and when permitted, shall construct a wooden or chain link fence with synthetic
webbing around the property boundaries that is six feet high so as to
completely block the view of what is enclosed.
   (C)   If an operator begins a recycling establishment, tow yard or mechanic
center in a new location, the location shall be screened to comply with
provisions of this chapter and the operator shall have obtained a permit prior
to beginning operation.
   (D)   The screened area of the recycling establishment, tow yard or mechanic
center shall be set back the distance of the required building setback line
along the front property line, except as permitted in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (E)   Recycling establishments, tow yards or mechanic centers which are side
by side are not required to screen common areas, but must screen outer
perimeters from view of the traveling public pursuant to this chapter.
   (F)   All recycling establishments, tow yards and mechanic centers shall
comply with all federal, state and local stormwater management standards.
(Ord. 2021-08, passed 11-16-20)

Building and Inspection prior to the erection of fencing to effect the

property from the view of the traveling motorist or any adjacent residential
district.
   (H)   Completed screening shall blend with the surrounding area as much as
possible.
   (I)   Screening shall be maintained in good repair at all times.
   (J)   All recyclable material shall be arranged so as to permit access by

as a practical matter be screened shall be removed within six months of receipt
of notice of violation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in Kentucky Revised
Statutes delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Hazard,
Kentucky (the “city”) hereby adopts the following floodplain management
regulations, as set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-17, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 2005-9, Art. 1, § B, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2024-17, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 2005-9, Art. 1, § C, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2024-17, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other floodprone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area.
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2005-9, Art. 1, § D, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2024-17, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   “A ZONE.” Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In “A ZONES,” floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).” A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. “ACCESSORY STRUCTURES” should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
“ACCESSORY STRUCTURES” are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole
barns, and hay sheds.
   “ACCESSORY USE.” A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   “ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).” Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   “A1-30 AND AE ZONES” Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.

interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the Floodplain
Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.
   “AR/A1 - A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AND AR/A ZONES.” Special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited
flood protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a
100-year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete
these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding
sources.
   “A99 ZONE.” That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system
under construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.” A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to
three feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “B AND X ZONES (SHADED).” Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile, and areas protected
by levees from the base flood.
   “BASE FLOOD.” A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the “100-year flood”). “BASE FLOOD” is the term
used throughout this chapter.
   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).” The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and
AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that
has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   “BASEMENT.” That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   “BUILDING.” A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made
facility or infrastructure. See definition for “STRUCTURE.”
   “C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES.” Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   “COMMUNITY.” A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).” A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the
regular program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures for protection from flooding.
   “COMMUNITY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA).” An area that has been determined by
the Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. “CRITICAL FACILITIES” include, but are not

important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
   “D ZONE.” An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
   “DEVELOPMENT.” Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,

freeboard requirements for residential and non-residential structures.)
   “ELEVATION CERTIFICATE.” A statement certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor on the FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification that verifies a structure’s elevation and other related
information to verify compliance with this chapter.
   “EMERGENCY PROGRAM.” The initial phase under which a community participates
in the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.

(BFE) used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the
structure.
   “ENCROACHMENT.” The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth,
fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a
floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   “EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.” Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMs effective before that date. “EXISTING CONSTRUCTION” may also be referred
to as “EXISTING STRUCTURES.”

or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the city based on
specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of
special flood hazards.
   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in floodprone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   “FLOODPROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the “REGULATORY FLOODWAY.”
   “FLOODWAY FRINGE.” That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in §§ 151.50 through 151.57, means
that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that
every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of
the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may
incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. “FREEBOARD” must be applied
not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also
to the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.” A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or
port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   “GOVERNING BODY.” The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality
that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.” The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior, or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).” Increased cost of compliance coverage
provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with state or
community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss
by flood. When a building covered by a standard flood insurance policy under
the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares the building to be
substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the
cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building. ICC coverage is
available on residential and non-residential buildings (this category includes
public or government buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal
buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   “KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE 151.250.” Plans for dams, levees, and the like to
be approved and permit issued by the Cabinet (Environmental and Public
Protection Cabinet) which provides substantially as follows:
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city,
county, or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the Cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the Cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to require approval
by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the state
shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the Cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this definition is intended to give the Cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch, or
system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the
same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by
the Cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water
resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control
thereof so notified. The Kentucky Bureau of Surface Mining through KRS Chapter
350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the
regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other
obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which
structures are permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining
operations.
   “KENTUCKY REVISED STATUTE 151.320.” Officers required to enforce law which
provides substantially as follows:

of KRS 151.250, 151.280 and 151.310 and rules and regulations issued
thereunder.
      (2)   When a violation of KRS 151.250, 151.280 or 151.310 within his or
her jurisdiction is brought to the attention of a mayor or chief executive
officer of a city or a county judge/executive, he or she shall immediately
notify the Cabinet of the location and details of such violation.

or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   “LEVEE SYSTEM.” A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
For a “LEVEE SYSTEM” to be recognized, the following criteria must be met:
      (1)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
      (2)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state
agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community

revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first
revision.)
   “MARKET VALUE.” The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. “MARKET VALUE” can be established by independent certified
appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value)

§ 151.12 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee,
the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Federal Insurance Administration, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.

§ 151.13 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION NOTICE AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Civil Offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of Violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See divisions (C)
and (D) below.
   (C)   Notice of Citation; Notice of Violation. If, at any time, a duly
authorized employee or agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable
cause to believe that a person has caused development to occur which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain
Administrator may issue a citation to the offender stating the violation, prior
notices of violation issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the
development into conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and
within what period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or
penalties are recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the
citation is issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date
the citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
   (D)   Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special
exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined no less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, and
in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day
such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

§ 151.21 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
151.07. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of Local
Administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application Stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade;
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-
residential structure will be floodproofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential floodproofed structure will meet
the floodproofing criteria in §§ 151.31(B) and § 151.33(B);
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction Stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
Zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, the
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and
floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make the corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

(Ord. 2005-9, Art. 5, § A, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2024-17, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in § 151.07, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower
than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with
standards of § 151.31(C).
      (1)   In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified.
      (2)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060,
Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for a state
floodplain permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining
floodway boundaries(and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed
construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall
be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no
more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at
those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where
hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section
shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and
at the locations specified by the Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that
significant flood damage will not occur, the Cabinet may require additional
cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for
making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
      (3)   In all other zones, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      (4)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community Building Inspection
Department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential Construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with § 151.31(A) or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
elevation;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in § 151.21(A)(3).
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in § 151.21(D);
      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated Structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g., that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation) shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions;
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.
      (1)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
         (a)   On individual lots or parcels;
         (b)   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (c)   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
         (d)   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (e)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; or
         (f)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood.
      (2)   All manufactured homes must be:
         (a)   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
         (b)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the
level of the base flood elevation; and
         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (3)   Excepting manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage
as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that
the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less

and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations,
is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 151.07 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If § 151.31(E) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§ 151.30 through 151.36.
   (F)   Standards for Utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
         (a)   Infiltration of floodwaters into the systems; and
         (b)   Discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
      (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them, or contamination from them during flooding.

Penalty, see § 151.13
§ 151.32 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 151.07, where
streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base
flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with §
151.07.

Penalty, see § 151.13
§ 151.33 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 151.07, are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards
associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined
channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO,
if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no

APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 151.40 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding.
This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a
structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood
elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare. The long-
term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if
variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in
this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met
before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen
out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more
appropriate.
(Ord. 2005-9, Art. 6, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2024-17, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.41 DESIGNATION OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
   The Board of Appeals established pursuant to § 150.20 of the code shall hear
and dispose of requests for variances and any appeals or decisions under this
chapter. All hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set
forth in § 150.20 except as specifically provided otherwise hereunder.
(Ord. 2005-9, Art. 6, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2024-17, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.42 DUTIES OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
   (A)   The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
   (B)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals or any
taxpayer may seek judicial review of any decision of the Board of Appeals by
commencement of an action in the Perry Circuit Court within 30 days following
the determination by the Board. The Board shall transmit to the Court its
entire record on appeal, including any stenographic record, if applicable. On
judicial review, the Court shall not set aside any decision of the Board unless
it finds as a matter of law that:
      (1)   The decision is arbitrary or capricious;
      (2)   The decision is contrary to law or outside the lawful jurisdiction
of the Board; or
      (3)   The decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the record
as a whole.

§ 151.43 APPEALS/VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   In passing upon such applications, the Appeals Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and the:
   (A)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
   (B)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   (C)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
   (D)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed
facility;
   (E)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of
functionally dependent facility;
   (F)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
   (G)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
   (H)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
   (I)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   (J)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
   (K)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
(Ord. 2005-9, Art 6, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2024-17, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.44 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
chapter, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (A)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard.
“MINIMUM NECESSARY” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the city need not grant permission for the
applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant
proposes, but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide
relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard. In the
instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be made that the
variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic
character and design of the structure.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in § 151.05 under
“Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as
defined in § 151.05) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
   (G)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of this chapter are satisfied and
that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize
flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats
to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
(Ord. 2005-9, Art. 6, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2024-17, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.45 VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.
   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that:
   (A)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
   (B)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Perry County Clerk’s Office and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(Ord. 2005-9, Art. 6, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2014-7, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.46 HISTORIC STRUCTURES.
   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (see § 151.05) upon determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
(Ord. 2005-9, Art. 6, passed 5-16-06; Am. Ord. 2014-7, passed 6-28-24)
§ 151.47 NO IMPACT CERTIFICATION WITHIN THE FLOODWAY.
   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

recorded by the County Clerk. Any such instrument of transfer, or sale, shall
be void and shall not be subject to be recorded unless the subdivision plat
subsequently receives final approval of the Planning Commission, but all rights
of such purchaser to damages are preserved. The description of such lot or
parcel by metes and bounds in any instrument of transfer or other document used
in the process of selling or transferring same shall not exempt the person
attempting to transfer from penalties provided or deprive the purchaser of any
rights or remedies he may otherwise have. Provided, however, any person, or his
agent, may agree to sell any lot or parcel of land located within a subdivision
by reference to an unapproved or unrecorded plat or by reference to a metes and
bounds description of such lot and any such executory contract of sale or
option to purchase may be recorded and shall be valid and enforceable so long
as the subdivision of land contemplated therein is lawful and the subdivision
plat subsequently receives final approval of the Planning Commission.

MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 155.30 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The Planning Commission shall impose the following general requirements and
require all subdividers to comply with the following principles of design in
the layout of subdivisions.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71)
§ 155.31 CLASSIFICATION, SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   (A)   Classification of land for subdivision. The land within the
subdivision jurisdiction of the city shall be classified into the following
categories in relation to topographical conditions. The land shall be
subdivided according to the regulations for that category. The U.S. Geological
Survey of the area shall be used to determine slopes, unless other information
can be furnished the Planning Commission showing the elevations and contours.
 
Land Type Percentage of Slope
I         15% or less
II        16% to 25%
III       26% to 35%
IV        36% or greater
 
   (B)   Suitability of land for subdivision.
      (1)   Sinkholes.
         (a)   Sinkholes and other depressions over abandoned mines shall not
be developed unless proof can be given that the sinkhole as well as the
surrounding area is safe for development. This proof must be reviewed by the
City Engineer for his approval, the soil conservation officer of the area for
his opinion, and other agencies who have jurisdiction. The Planning Commission
may increase the reserved area around the sinkhole if deemed necessary for the
safety and welfare of the community.
         (b)   Natural sinkholes and other similar depressions and the area
within 25 feet horizontally from the lowest point of the sinkhole, or that area
subject to periodic flooding, whichever is greater, shall be preserved in its
natural state for the purpose of providing drainage of the surrounding area. No
building, street, or any other improvement shall be placed in this area. The
Planning Commission shall have the power to increase the reserved area around
the sinkhole if drainage conditions warrant this action. The sinkhole may be
“punched” or otherwise altered to improve drainage.
      (2)   Flood hazards. Land subject to flooding shall not be platted for
residential use or for any other use which may increase the danger to health,
life, or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazards. This land within the
subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for those uses as will not be
endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or will not result in
conditions contrary to the public welfare. To ensure that lots will be located
only where they will provide flood-free house sites, the Planning Commission
may require the subdivider to provide elevation and flood profiles to
demonstrate that the house sites will be completely free from the danger of
flooding.
      (3)   Type IV land. Where development is proposed on Type IV land, the
Planning Commission shall review all construction drawings as well as the
preliminary plats and final plans. This shall include construction drawings of
all buildings, including foundations, and other improvements to the land.
      (4)   Premature development. The Planning Commission may refuse to
approve what it considers to be scattered or premature subdivision of land
which would involve danger or injury to the public health, safety, welfare, or
prosperity by reason of lack of adequate water supply, schools, proper
drainage, good roads and transportation facilities, or other public services,
or which would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for supply
of these services.
      (5)   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be
subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to poor drainage, rock
formations, and other conditions that may increase the danger to health, life,
or property, or aggravate erosion or flood hazards; and, if from adequate
investigation, conducted by all the public agencies concerned, is determined
that in the best interest of the public the land or a portion thereof should
not be platted and developed for the purpose proposed, the Planning Commission
shall not approve the land or portions thereof for subdivision.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.32 COMMUNITY ASSETS TO BE PRESERVED.
   In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for natural features such as
large trees, unusual rock formations, and watercourses; for sites which have
historical significance; and for similar assets which if preserved will add
attractiveness and value to the subdivision and to the community. The Planning
Commission may prepare a list of all features within its area of subdivision
jurisdiction which it deems worthy of preservation.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.33 PARCELS LARGER THAN ORDINARY BUILDING LOTS.
   When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots,
these parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future
streets and logical re-subdivision.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.34 STREETS.
   (A)   The width and locations of all streets in a proposed subdivision shall
conform to the city's comprehensive plan.
   (B)   All streets classified as arterial streets by the comprehensive plan
may be considered as limited access in accordance with KRS 177.220 through
177.310, defined herein as controlled access. All points of access shall be as
approved by the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Relationship to topography. In all classifications of land, streets
shall be designed with respect to topography to produce the most usable and
properly situated lots, provide proper drainage for storm water, and produce
proper grades. On Type II, III, and IV land, streets should be parallel to the
contour of hillside, following natural benches or breaks in the hillside.
   (D)   Street extensions.
      (1)   Extension of present streets. The street layout of the proposed
subdivision shall provide for the continuation or extension of streets already
existing in areas adjacent to the area being subdivided unless the Planning
Commission deems continuation or extension undesirable for specific reasons of
topography or design.
      (2)   Extension of proposed streets. Where, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, it is desirable to provide street access to adjoining
properties, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundaries
of these properties. Where the Planning Commission deems it necessary, dead-end
streets constructed on Type I land shall be provided with a temporary
turnaround. On Type II, III and IV land, a “T” turnaround shall be permitted
where in the opinion of the Planning Commission, a circular turnaround cannot
be built due to topography.
   (E)   Length of streets. The rights-of-way and pavements shall be determined
by use of the definition of contained in §
155.05, land use along the street, and the length of the street as set forth
herein.
      (1)   Arterial streets. There shall be no limit placed on the length of
arterial streets.
      (2)   Collector streets.
         (a)   Standard. Collector streets which serve minor streets and are
not dead-end collector streets as indicated in division (b) below shall not be
limited in length. Their length is usually only a few miles.
         (b)   Dead-end. Collector streets which are permanently dead-end, over
1,000 feet in length, and serve only single-family dwellings, will be dead-end
collectors. There, maximum length is unlimited. The principal reason for these
streets to be dead-end is extreme topography preventing their extension.
      (3)   Minor streets.
         (a)   Through. These streets are through streets or serve lots other
than residential lots. Their length is unlimited in nonresidential areas, but
limited to 1,200 feet between intersections in residential areas.
         (b)   Local. These streets are cul-de-sacs or loop streets which serve
only single-family dwelling units. Local streets intersect collector streets.
Local cul-de-sacs are limited to 1,000 feet in length. Loop streets are limited
to 2,000 feet in length.
      (4)   Marginal access streets. There is no limit to the length of
marginal access streets. Their length is determined by the street they parallel
and serve.
      (5)   Alleys. There is no limit to the length of alleys. Their length is
usually no more than a few blocks.
   (F)   Right-of-way required.
      (1)   Right-of-way widths. The dedication of right-of-way for new streets
measured from lot line to lot line shall be as shown on the city's
comprehensive plan, or if not shown thereon, shall meet the following
standards:
Right-of-way Widths (Feet)

         (b)   * shall mean permitted only with permission of the Planning
Commission.
         (c)   ** shall mean permitted only with permission of the Planning
Commission. Right-of-way may be lowered where five or fewer single-family
dwellings are served. The right-of-way cannot be less than 20 feet.
      (2)   Dead-end streets (Cul-de-sacs).
         (a)   Collector streets - dead-end. Minor collector streets over 1,000
feet long on all classifications of land and permanently dead-end shall be
provided with a turnaround having a radius at the outside of the right-of-way
of at least 50 feet.
         (b)   Minor streets - local.
            l. Type I land. Streets which are designed so as to have one end
permanently closed shall not be longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at
the closed end with a turnaround having a radius at the outside of the right-
of-way of at least 50 feet.
            2.   Type II and III land. Streets which are designed so as to have
one end permanently closed shall not be longer than 1,000 feet and shall be
provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a radius at the outside of
the right-of-way of at least 40 feet. Where a circular turnaround cannot be
constructed due to topographical conditions, a “T” turnaround shall be
permitted. The right-of-way at the “T” turnaround shall be at least 50 feet
deep from the right-of-way centerline, and 20 feet wide in the extensions.
            3.   Type IV land. The standards for Type II and III land shall
apply to Type IV land; however, where five or fewer dwelling units are served,
the standards may be lowered.
      (3)   Extended streets. The street system for the proposed subdivision
shall provide for extending streets at the same or greater width, but in no
case shall a street extension be of less width than the minimum width required
in these regulations for a street in its category, except where in the opinion
of the Planning Commission topographical conditions do not permit the
extension.
      (4)   Existing streets.
         (a)    Subdivision on both sides of street. Where the subdivision is
on both sides of an existing street, sufficient right- of-way shall be
dedicated to give the street the required right-of-way.
         (b)   Subdivision on one side of street. Where the subdivision is to
take place on only one side of a street, one-half of the right-of-way needed to
give the street the required right-of-way shall be dedicated.
      (5)   Streets along property lines. Where a proposed street runs along a
property line of the proposed subdivision, the street right-of-way pavement and
other requirements must be met in full.
      (6)   Cut or fill. Where a cut or fill road slope is outside the normal
right-of-way of the street, a slope easement shall be provided of sufficient
width to permit maintenance of the slopes.
      (7)   Split roadways. Where a split roadway better preserves the natural
topography of the land, a split roadway shall be used and additional right-of-
way shall be granted equal to the separation.
      (8)   Commercial areas. If the Planning Commission deems it necessary,
street rights-of-ways through commercial areas or present or proposed business
areas shall be increased ten feet on each side for needed parking.
      (9)   Extraordinary physical conditions. If the Planning Commission deems
it necessary where extraordinary physical conditions exist, the Planning
Commission may alter the right-of- way requirements.
      (10)   Maximum dedication The city's comprehensive plan may indicate
greater right-of-way widths for certain arterial streets, but in no case shall
the subdivider be required to dedicate a right-of-way of more than 84 feet for
any one street.
   (G)   Additional streets required.
      (1)   Marginal access streets. Where the proposed subdivision abuts upon
or contains an existing or proposed arterial street or highway on which traffic
volumes and vehicular speeds warrant special safety considerations, the
Planning Commission may require that marginal access streets be provided in
order that no lots will front on the existing or proposed arterial street or
highway.
      (2)   Alleys. Alleys may be provided to give access to the rear of all
lots used for business and industrial purposes. Alleys shall not be provided in
residential blocks except in cases where the subdivider produces evidence of
the need for alleys which is satisfactory to the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Conflicting traffic or land use. When a proposed subdivision
contains or is adjacent to existing or proposed railroad rights-of-way,
arterial street right-of-way, other significant rights- of-way, or conflicting
and detrimental land uses, the Planning Commission may require marginal access
streets, reverse frontage lots, lots with rear service alleys, lots with
additional depth, or other measures which may be necessary for protection of
abutting properties and the maintenance or function of major traffic arteries.
   (H)   Private streets and reserve strips.
      (1)   There shall be no private streets platted within a subdivision.
      (2)   There shall be no reserve strips in a subdivision except where
their control is definitely vested in the city or county under conditions
approved by the Planning Commission as authorized in this chapter.
   (I)   Street intersections.
      (1)   Number of approaches. Intersections involving more than four basic
street approaches shall be prohibited. Merging lanes and deceleration lanes are
considered as parts of one street approach.
      (2)   Angle at intersection.
         (a)   Type I land. For a tangent distance of at least 100 feet,
measured from the intersection of right-of-way lines, all streets should
intersect at an angle of 90 degrees. In no case shall the angle of intersection
be less than 75 degrees.
         (b)   Type II, III, and IV land. Intersections on these types of land
shall be dictated by topography. The standards contained in division (A) above
shall be used when possible.
      (3)   Radii at intersections.
         (a)   Type I land. Street curb and edge intersections shall be rounded
by radii of at least 20 feet.
         (b)   Type II, III, and IV land . Street curb and edge intersections
shall be rounded by radii of at least 10 feet.
      (4)   Street jogs.
         (a)   Type I land. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be made.
         (b)   Type II, III, and IV land. Street jogs with centerline offsets
of less than 150 feet shall not be made into arterial streets. On all other
streets, where topographical conditions indicate, placement of street jogs with
centerline offsets of less than 150 feet may be permitted.
   (J)   Horizontal curves.
      (1)   Reverse curves.
         (a)   Type I land. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
         (b)   Type II, III, and IV land. The above standards contained in
division (a) above shall apply for arterial streets. Other streets should be
designed so as to follow contours.
      (2)   Curve radius. Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten
degrees in the alignment of a street, a curve with a radius adequate to ensure
safe sight distance shall be made. The minimum radii or curves shall be:
 
Street Type Type I Land Type II, III, and IV Land
Arterial    300 feet    300 feet
Collector   300 feet    Follow contours
Minor       100 feet    Follow contours
 
   (K)   Vertical curves. All changes in grade for streets shall be connected
by a vertical curve of a minimum length necessary to provide adequate sight
distance and other safety factors. To calculate the minimum length for the
curve connecting changes in grade:
      (1)   Calculate the algebraic difference in grades.
      (2)   Multiply by the appropriate value.
         (a)   Values for crest curve:
            Arterial and collector streets   50
            Minor street    28
         (b)   Values for sag curve:
            Arterial and collector streets   50
            Minor streets   35
   (L)   Street grades.
      (1)   Maximum grades. Street grades shall conform to the following:
 
Street Type Type I Land Type II, III, and IV Land
Arterial    5%          7%
Collector   7%          12%
Minor       12%         15%
 
   In addition, minor streets may have a grade of 20% for a distance of no more
than 500 feet. However, driveways or other access shall not be allowed to enter
a section of street which has a grade in excess of 15%
      (2)   Grades for drainage. All streets shall be designed so as to provide
for the discharge of surface water from the pavement and from the right-of-way
by grading and drainage. For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall
not be less than 0.5%.
      (3)   Excessive grades at intersections. When a street grade at the
approach of an intersection exceeds 3%, a leveling area shall be provided with
grades of not greater than 3% for a distance of 50 feet from the intersection
of street centerlines. Vertical curves shall then be used to connect the
intersecting grades.
   (M)   Street elevations.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall not approve streets which will be
subject to inundation or flooding. All streets must be located at elevations
which will make them flood-free in order that portions of the subdivision will
not be isolated by floods. Where flood conditions exist, the Planning
Commission shall require profiles and elevations of streets in order to
determine the advisability of permitting the proposed subdivision activity.
      (2)   Fill may be used in areas subject to flooding in order to provide
flood-free streets if the fill does not unduly increase flood heights. Drainage
openings shall be designed so as not to restrict the flow of water and thereby
unduly increase flood heights. Fills and drainage openings shall be approved by
the City Engineer.
   (N)   Street names.
      (1)   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with already
existing and named streets shall bear the names of the existing streets.
      (2)   The name of a proposed street which is not in alignment with an
existing street shall not duplicate the name of any existing street,
irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place,
court, land, road, pike, highway, parkway, or similar suffix.

155.99
§ 155.35 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Block lengths shall not exceed 1,200 feet or be less than 400 feet,
except as the Planning Commission considers necessary to secure efficient use
of land or desired features of street layout. On Type II, III, and IV land,
this provision shall apply where feasible. Where topographical conditions
warrant, this provision may be waived.
   (B)   Blocks over 750 feet in length shall have a midblock walk near the
center of the block connecting the streets on either side of the long block.
The right-of-way for these walks shall not be less than five feet in width.
   (C)   Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of minimum
depth. However, where this would require lots to front on an arterial street or
highway, or the size of the property prevents two tiers of lots, the Planning
Commission may approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.36 LOTS.
   (A)   Street frontage. All lots shall front on a public street or road for a
minimum distance of 60 feet on Type I land, 80 feet on Type II land, 100 feet
on Type III land, and 150 feet on Type IV land. However, lots which front on
the turnarounds of permanently dead-end streets or on curves shall front on
such turnarounds or curves for a minimum distance of 40 feet on Type I land, 50
feet on Type II land, 60 feet on Type III land, and 75 feet on Type IV land.
   (B)   Access to lots.
      (1)   Type I land.
         (a)   Lots on or near arterial streets. Access to lots abutting only
on arterial rights-of-way shall conform with §
155.34, but in no case shall the access be closer than 125 feet from an
intersection. A lot which abuts a non-arterial street which intersects an
arterial street shall have access only to the non-arterial street at a distance
of not less than 75 feet from the intersection of the centerlines.
         (b)   Lots on or near collector streets. A lot which abuts only on a
collector street shall have access to the lot at a distance not less than 75
feet from the intersection of the centerlines. A lot which abuts a minor street
which connects with a collector street shall have access to only the minor
street at a distance not greater than 50 feet from the collector street.
         (c)   Minor streets. Lots which abut only on minor streets shall have
access at a distance not less than 50 feet from the intersection of the
centerlines.
         (d)   Marginal access streets. Lots abutting on marginal access
streets shall have access at a distance no greater than 75 feet from the
intersection of the centerlines. If a lot abuts both an arterial street or
collector and a marginal access street, access shall be given only along the
marginal access street.
         (e)   Alleys. All non-residential lots may have access to an alley.
However, an alley cannot be used as the primary access point to a commercial or
industrial use or other uses which generate a large volume of traffic.
      (2)   Type II, III, and IV land. The regulations contained in division
(B)(1) of this section shall be followed where topo-graphy permits this
development. In all other cases, the access to a lot shall be not less than 50
feet from the intersection of the centerline of two or more streets.
   (C)   Development of hazardous areas. When lots are located on land which is
subject to flooding, subsidence, or other hazards injurious to the health and
safety of potential users, and when these hazards cannot be eliminated or
adequate safeguards provided to protect the health and safety of potential
users, the Planning Commission may declare these lots to be unsuitable for
development and disapprove plans to develop or subdivide these lots.
   (D)   Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street
centerlines and radial to curved street centerlines. Rear lot lines should
consist of straight lines with a minimum number of deflections.
   (E)   Dimensions. The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be such as
the Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use
contemplated.
      (1)   Lot dimensions in the city code shall conform to the requirements
of the zoning code, except that residential lots not served by public sewers
shall be at least 60 feet wide at the building setback line and 1,200 square
feet in area or the minimum lot width and area determined by the County Health
Officer, whichever width and area is larger.
      (2)   In areas where no zoning code is in effect, minimum lot dimensions
shall be as follows:
 
Land Type Area (Square Feet) Width At Building Line (Feet)
I         6,500              75
II        10,000             80
III       20,000             100
IV        40,000             150
 
      (3)   In areas where no zoning code is in effect, residential lots not
served by public sewers shall have a minimum lot width at the building setback
line and a minimum lot area as determined by the County Health Officer based on
percolation tests and other health factors. However, in no case shall a lot not
served by public sewers be less than 60 feet in width at the building setback
line and less than 1,200 square feet in area.
      (4)   The minimum width and minimum area of residential lots to be served
by individual private wells shall be determined by the County Health Officer
after investigation of soil conditions, the proposed sewerage system, and the
depth of groundwater.
   (F)   Building setback line.
      (1)   Required setback line. The building setback line shall meet the
requirements of the zoning code. Where the zoning code is not in effect, the
building setback line for all lots, including double- frontage and corner lots,
shall be no less than 25 feet from the street right-of-way. However, on Type
II, III, and IV land, structures used for automobile storage may be no less
than five feet from the street right-of-way along all minor streets, with the
permission of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Variance from established setback lines. Once a setback line in an
area of a subdivision is established, all buildings shall be built on this
line. However, with the permission of the Planning Commission, setback lines in
residential subdivisions may be varied 10 feet from the established setback
lines, but shall not be less than 25 feet. Permission for variance can only be
granted if it is shown that the privacy of the homes and yards in question is
maintained. The permission shall be recorded on the final plat. The Planning
Commission may review the building construction plans where permission is
granted, and require changes that will maintain privacy.
      (3)   Obstructions to vision at street intersections prohibited. Corner
lots, except as provided in the zoning code, shall be free from all
obstructions to traffic visibility between points 75 feet, measured along the
street centerline, from the intersection of the centerlines. The requirements
of this division shall not be deemed to prohibit any necessary retaining wall,
or hillside, or automobile storage structure allowed in division (F)(1) of this
section on Type II, III, and IV land.
   (G)   Yard requirements. Yard requirements for residential subdivisions or
the portions thereof inside the city shall be the same as the yard requirements
set forth in the zoning code for the zoning district or districts in which they
are located. Minimum yard requirements for residential subdivisions or the
portions thereof located where no zoning ordinance is in effect shall be as
follows:
 
Yard  Feet
Front 25
Rear  20
Side  10

§ 155.37 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (A)   These regulations are so written to discourage on-street parking on
all land except Type I land. The Planning Commission shall have the power to
increase the number of off-street parking spaces, where deemed necessary, in
order to fulfill this intent.
   (B)   Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the zoning
code where the zoning code is in effect.
   (C)   Where the zoning code is not in effect, off-street parking space shall
be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley. Parking space shall be
provided on the premises so that there will be no generation of automobile
parking on any street. For the purpose of this division, an off-street parking
space shall consist of a space adequate for parking an automobile with room for
opening doors on both sides, together with properly related access to a public
street or alley and maneuvering room. Required off-street parking areas for
three or more automobiles shall have individual spaces marked, and shall be so
designed, maintained, and regulated that no parking or maneuvering incidental
to parking shall be on any public street, walk, or alley, and so that any
automobile may be parked and unparked without moving another. For purposes of
rough computation, an off-street parking space and necessary access and
maneuvering room may be estimated at 400 square feet, but off-street parking
requirements shall be considered to be met only when actual spaces meeting the
requirements above are provided and maintained, improved in a manner
appropriate to the circumstances of the case.
   (D)   Parking standards. The following standards comprise the minimum off-
street parking requirements for several common types of buildings and uses
listed. These standards shall be followed where the zoning code is not in
effect.

                                        One space per unit plus one space for
                                        every three employees. If a restaurant
Hotels and motels                       comprises part of the use, restaurant
                                        parking standards shall be required in
                                        addition to the above.
                                        One parking space for every two
                                        employees at maximum employment on a
Manufacturing and warehousing           single shift, plus one space for each
                                        truck operated by the business. The
                                        Planning Commission may require
                                        additional space if it deems necessary.
                                        One space for each employee employed or
                                        expected to be employed in the office
Office building                         building. This standard shall also
                                        apply to office buildings which are
                                        part of another use.
                                        One space for every three seats
Restaurant                              available at maximum capacity. Employee
                                        parking shall be provided at a ratio of
                                        one space for every three employees.
Single-family residences and townhouses Two spaces per dwelling unit.
 
   (E)   Location of parking facilities. Where the zoning code is not in
effect, the arrangement of off-street parking space shall be as follows. Off-
street parking space required for any building or use may be located within 400
feet from the premises it serves, but detached therefrom, or may be
consolidated into a large parking area serving other buildings and uses. Either
arrangement must be approved by the Planning Commission. This off-premises
parking space, if allowed, shall be deemed required space associated with the
permitted use and shall not hereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any
manner. The Planning Commission may require a plat, deed, and any other proof
necessary to show that required parking space, if located off the premises it
serves, is controlled by and available to the applicant prior to the granting
of a building permit.
   (F)   Parking spaces, and the access thereto, shall be hard-surfaced asphalt
or concrete.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.38 OFF-STREET LOADING SPACES.
   (A)   Where the zoning code is not in effect, all buildings and uses which
generate regular trucking traffic shall be provided with sufficient off-street
loading and unloading space on the premises so that they will generate no
loading or unloading activity on their required parking spaces or on any
street. The Planning Commission shall interpret the amount of loading and
unloading space required for any building or use whenever it is unable to apply
this standard literally.
   (B)   Loading and unloading spaces, and the access thereto, shall be hard-
surfaced asphalt or concrete.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.39 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Except where alleys are permitted for the purpose, the Planning
Commission shall require easements at least 12 feet in width centered along all
rear lot lines in Type I land, and either along all rear lot lines or along the
street right-of-way in Type II, III, or IV land for poles, wires, conduits,
storm sewers, sanitary sewers, gas mains, water mains, heat mains, and other
utility facilities. Where necessary or advisable, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, similar easements shall be provided alongside lot lines
for access.
   (B)   If a stream flows through or adjacent to the proposed subdivision, the
plat plan shall provide for an easement or right-of- way along the stream for a
floodway. For smaller streams, the plan shall also provide for channel
improvement to enable them to carry all reasonable floods within banks. The
flood elevations of houses shall be high enough to be well above the
extraordinary flood. The floodway easement shall be wide enough to provide for
future enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent areas become more highly
developed and runoff rates are increased.
   (C)   When necessary, utility and drainage easements shall connect with
existing easements on adjoining properties.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.40 COMMUNITY FACILITIES.
   During the review of subdivision plats, the Planning Commission shall
consider the adequacy of existing or proposed community facilities which will
serve the additional population to be housed in a proposed subdivision.
Subdividers shall also give consideration to dedicating or reserving land for
facilities which will be needed in a subdivision such as public buildings,
recreational areas, shopping facilities, schools, open space, and public access
to waterways and other public facilities. Areas provided or reserved for
community facilities shall be adequate for building sites, landscaping, off-
street parking, and the like.

§ 155.50 CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission or
accepted for record by the County Clerk until the required improvements listed
in this subchapter are constructed in a satisfactory manner and certified as
such by the developer's engineer and approved by the appropriate officials
having jurisdiction. In lieu of prior construction, the Board of Commissioners
may accept a security bond or certified check running to the city in an amount
equal to the estimated cost of installation of the required improvements in
accordance with §
155.18 (I).
(Ord. 930.l, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.51 IMPROVEMENTS MADE UNDER BOND OR OTHER SECURITY.
   (A)   When a bond, cash, check or other form of security is posted as
provided in §
155.50, the Administrative Officer or Planning Commission may set a reasonable
time for the improvements to be properly installed but no more than 18 months
unless (1) the Administrative Officer or the Planning Commission shall
otherwise provide for a longer period as a condition of approval of the plat;
or (2) the Administrative Officer or the Planning Commission shall extend the
time period for completion upon request and for good cause shown.
   (B)   The Board of Commissioners may release the security bond or cash only
with the recommendation of the Planning Commission that the Board of
Commissioners accept the dedication of the streets and other public grounds in
the subdivision in question. The Planning Commission shall make this
recommendation after it has received a report from the City Engineer that all
improvements have been properly installed, that the final plat has been
approved, and after the Planning Commission determines that all requirements of
this chapter and the zoning code have been met.
   (C)   If improvements are not installed at the end of the initial period and
if an additional period of time is allowed, the Planning Commission may order
the Administrative Officer to cease from issuing building permits and
certificates of occupancy in the subdivision in question until such time as the
Planning Commission determines that the improvements are properly installed or
sufficient action has been taken to install the improvements properly. At the
end of the extended period of time, no building permits or certificates of
occupancy shall be issued until all improvements are properly installed or
sufficient action has been taken to install the improvements properly.
   (D)   If it is determined by the Planning Commission that the subdivider
will not properly install the improvements and that the improvements are
necessary for the public health, welfare, and safety, the Planning Commission
may recommend to the Board of Commissioners that the city take action to notify
the subdivider and utilize the posted bond, cash, or other form of security, to
install the improvements. If this action is taken, no new building permit or
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all improvements are installed
properly as determined by the Administrative Officer or Planning Commission, as
applicable, for the minor or major subdivision.

§ 155.52 MONUMENTS.
   (A)   Concrete monuments at least 36 inches in length and four inches in
diameter or four inches square shall be set at all corners of the subdivision
indicated on the plat. The top of the monument shall be flat and shall have an
indented cross to properly identify the location. Except in cases where it is
deemed clearly unreasonable or unfeasible by the Planning Commission, these
monuments shall be described on the final plat in relation to the located
section corners of the coordinate system of the Commonwealth until such time as
the City Engineer may establish triangulation points within the jurisdiction of
the planning unit. After the triangulation points are established, the
monuments shall be described on the final plat in relation to the triangulation
points and in accordance with the regulations established by the City Engineer.
   (B)   Iron pin monuments 3/4 inch in diameter and at least 24 inches long
shall be placed at all lot corners. These pins shall be placed only after all
grading and other construction has been completed. A guard stake at least 1
inch by 3 inches by 24 inches shall be placed next to each pin with the lot
number and the number of the adjoining lot plainly lettered on the flat faces
of the stake.

      (3)   ** shall mean permitted only with approval of Planning Commission.
Pavement widths may be lowered where five or fewer single- family dwellings are
served. However, the pavement must be at least ten feet wide. This does not
apply to split roadways.
   (B)   Cul-de-sac pavement.
      (1)   Type I land. The pavement of the turnaround of a cul-de- sac shall
have a radius of 40 feet.
      (2)   Type II and III land. Where a circular turnaround cannot be
constructed due to topographical conditions, a “T” turnaround shall be
permitted. The pavement of the “T” shall extend 40 feet from the centerline of
the street. The pavement of the “T” shall be at least ten feet wide.
      (3)   Type IV land. The standards for Type II and III land in division
(2) above shall apply to Type IV land. However, where five or fewer dwelling
units are served, the standard may be lowered.
   (C)   Grading specifications. All streets, roads, and alleys shall be graded
to their full widths by the subdivider so that pave-ments and sidewalks can be
constructed on the same level plane.
      (1)   Cuts and fills.
         (a)   Major cuts, excavation, grading and filling where the same
materially changes the site and its relationship with surrounding areas or
materially affects these areas, shall not be permitted if the excavation,
grading, and filling will result in a slope exceeding a vertical rise of one
foot for each two feet of horizontal distance between abutting lots or between
adjoining tracts of land, except where adequate provision is made to prevent
slides and erosion by cribbing and retaining walls.
         (b)   In cuts, all tree stumps, boulders, organic material, soft clay,
and spongy material, and objectionable material shall be removed to a depth of
at least two feet below the natural ground surface. This objectionable matter,
as well as similar matter from cuts, shall be removed from the right-of-way
area and disposed of in such a manner that it will not become incorporated in
fills or hinder proper operation of the drainage system. The fill material
shall be free from trash and other foreign objects.
         (c)   Fills shall be free of all debris and foreign matter and
compacted to a density of no less than 90% of maximum density at its optimum
moisture content.
         (d)   Travel surfaces and at least three feet of shoulder constructed
on Type III and IV land shall be placed on a bench, natural or man-made, on the
hillside and no portion shall be constructed on fill adjacent to or below the
bench.
      (2)   Preparation of the subgrade. Before grading is started, the entire
right-of-way area shall be first cleared of all tree stumps, roots, brush, and
other objectionable materials and all trees not intended for preservation. The
subgrade shall be properly shaped, rolled, and uniformly compacted to conform
with the accepted cross- section and grades in conformance with the State
Department of Highway's current specifications for preparation of the subgrade.
   (D)   Pavement specifications for streets. The subdivider shall provide
street pavements which shall be designed to carry the expected traffic loads
and which shall conform with the State Department of Highway's current standard
specifications for portland cement concrete pavement or bituminous concrete
pavement. All street pavements shall be of a dust-free type. Loose aggregate
will not be considered a complete pavement.
   (E)   Curbs and gutters.  
      (1)   Curbs shall not be less than six inches in height and shall be
constructed of portland cement concrete. Back fill shall be higher than the
curb and shall slope toward the curb in order to ensure that surface water
drains into the storm drainage system. The curb and gutter shall empty into an
underground storm sewer system, or with the approval of the City Engineer and
Planning Commission, into a stream or other natural watercourse.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may waive the requirement for curb and
gutter in single-family residential developments if they are not deemed
necessary for proper drainage and where all lots are greater than 100 feet in
width at the building line.
         (a)   Where curbs and gutters are waived, an additional five feet of
right-of-way on each side of the proposed street shall be dedicated. Additional
right-of-way to facilitate drainage shall be dedicated, if necessary.
         (b)   Drainage ditches shall be constructed within the street right-
of-way. The ditches shall be of adequate size to carry the runoff water and to
prevent flooding. The Planning Commission may require concrete-lined ditches or
any other improvements needed to prevent flooding and erosion. The ditch line
shall be a distance of ten feet or more from the edge-of-metal on an arterial
street. On other streets, the drainage ditch line shall be five feet from the
edge-of-metal. The shoulder, ditch, and remaining right-of-way shall be sodded
or otherwise stabilized from the edge-of-metal to the right- of-way line.
         (c)   Access to lots along streets where drainage ditches are used
shall be either by a spill or over a culvert.
            1.   Where a spill is used, it shall be so designed as to prevent
water from crossing the ditch. At the ditch line, the spill shall be at least
six inches below the street pavement and right- of-way line and constructed to
allow the free flow of water through the ditch. The spill shall be constructed
of portland cement at least six inches thick and it shall start at the edge-of-
metal and may stop at the right-of-way line.
            2.   Where a culvert-type access is used, an opening of at least 15
inches shall be made under the access at the ditch line. The City Engineer or
Planning Commission may require a greater opening when necessary. Bulkheads
shall be constructed on each side of the opening to prevent erosion. The
opening shall be constructed so as to maintain the flow of water in the ditch.
Steps shall also be taken to prevent the flow of water over the access, either
from the lot to the street or from the street to the lot.
   (F)   Street name signs. The Planning Commission shall require the
installation of durable street name signs at all intersections.

155.99
§ 155.54 SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   For the safety of pedestrians in residential and commercial
subdivisions, the subdivider shall build portland cement sidewalks within the
street right-of-way on both sides of the street to meet the following
specifications:
      (1)   Required width and depth.
 
Use                       Width of Sidewalks (Feet) Depth of Sidewalks (Inches)
Single-family or duplex   4                         4
housing developments
Multi-family developments 5                         4
Commercial developments   8                         4
 
      (2)   Sidewalks along marginal access streets. Where a marginal access
road parallels an arterial street, the Planning Commission may waive the
requirements of sidewalks along the arterial street and on the inside of the
marginal access street. Sidewalks shall be required on the outside of the
marginal access street.
      (3)   Sidewalks within five feet of the pavement shall be built at an
elevation at or above the elevation of the top of the curb. In residential
areas, the sidewalks shall be constructed at least three feet from the curb.
      (4)   Sidewalk construction where curb and gutters are waived. Sidewalks
shall be constructed between the ditch and the right-of-way line where curb and
gutters have been waived as provided in §
155.53 (E)(2). The sidewalks shall be built at least two feet from the ditch
line and shall not be built in the ditch, so as to impede the flow of water in
the ditch, or as to cause erosion or flooding. Sidewalks closer than five feet
from the pavement shall be at an elevation greater than that of the street
pavement.
      (5)   Sidewalks in Type II, III, and IV land. Sidewalks in Type II, III,
and IV land shall not necessarily follow or parallel the street. Sidewalks may
follow other contours and shall be constructed as to have minimum effect on the
natural surroundings. Where provided, however, sidewalks shall serve all
developable lots.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may waive the requirement of sidewalks in
single-family unit developments where it is shown that sidewalks are not needed
for the safety of pedestrians and where lots are at least 100 feet wide at the
building line.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.55 BUILDING SITES.
   (A)   Building area. The following requirements shall govern the percentage
of a residential lot that shall remain in its natural state including no cut or
fill, or developed solely for recreational purposes. These figures shall also
apply to nonresidential uses on Type II, III, and IV land.
 
Land Type Minimum percent of site to remain in natural state
I         30
II        60
III       90
IV        90
 
   (B)   The building site on each lot shall be at least 12 inches above the
elevation of the street pavement, unless the Planning Commission determines
that because of natural or man-made drainage systems, the building site is
completely free from flooding. No building site shall be constructed to create
or increase a flooding condition.
   (C)   Emergency access. Each building site shall be so situated that access
can be provided for emergency vehicles.
   (D)   Use of cuts and fills. Major cuts, excavation, grading, and filling
where this materially changes the site and its relationship with surrounding
areas or materially affects these areas, shall not be permitted if the
excavation, grading, and filling will result in a slope exceeding a vertical
rise of one foot for each two feet of horizontal distance between abutting lots
or between adjoining tracts of land, except where adequate provision is made to
prevent slides and erosion by cribbing and retaining walls.
      (1)   Any fill use on a building site shall be free of all debris and
foreign matter and compacted to 90% of maximum density at its optimum moisture
content.
      (2)   The foundation shall be built upon solid, undisturbed material and
not upon the fill.
      (3)   In cuts, all tree stumps, boulders, organic material, soft clay,
and spongy and other objectionable material shall be removed to a depth of at
least two feet below the natural ground surface. This objectionable matter, as
well as similar matter from cuts, shall be removed from the site area and
disposed of in a manner so that it will not become incorporated in fills or
hinder proper operation of the drainage system. The fill material shall be free
from trash and other foreign objects.
      (4)   Buildings shall be no closer than five feet from the base of a
slope.
   (E)   Where construction takes place on Type IV land, the Planning
Commission shall review all construction plans of all improvements and make
necessary improvements and changes.
(Ord. 930.l, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.56 UTILITIES AND DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Utilities shall be provided in rear lot easements wherever possible.
Whenever it is necessary to install utilities in street rights-of-way, the
following requirements shall apply. After grading is completed and approved and
before any pavement base is applied, all of the in-street underground work,
such as water mains, gas mains, and the like and all service connections, shall
be completely installed and approved throughout the length of the street and
across the flat section. Where the utility mains are outside the pavement area,
the subdivider may be allowed to omit the installation of service connections,
provided that at that time as these service connections are needed, they may be
jacked across the street without breaking or weakening the existing pavement.
Where rock is known to exist beneath the pavement area and at a depth as to
interfere with the jacking of service connections, the Planning Commission
shall require the complete installation of service connections before any base
is applied. In cases where underground utilities must be provided within the
right-of- way of streets, they should not be installed under the paved portions
of these streets.
   (B)   Water supply system. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission,
the public water supply is reasonably accessible or available to the proposed
subdivision, the subdivider shall construct a complete water distribution
system according to the specifications of the agency having jurisdiction. This
water distribution system shall adequately serve all lots, shall include
appropriately spaced fire hydrants, and shall be properly connected to the
public water supply. Where a public water supply is not within a reasonable
distance or otherwise available, the subdivider shall normally be required to
construct a similar water distribution system and connect it with an alternate
supply approved by the County Health Officer. If the Planning Commission
approves the use of individual wells, lot sizes shall meet the requirements in
§
155.36.
   (C)   Sanitary sewers. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the
public sanitary sewer system is reasonably accessible or available to the
proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall construct a subdivision sewer system
to adequately serve all lots and connect the subdivision system to the public
system after the City Engineer or other appropriate official has approved the
size of lines. Where lots cannot be served by the extension of an existing
public sanitary sewer, the subdivider shall either obtain approval of lot sizes
for individual septic tanks and disposal fields from the County Health Officer,
and in accordance with §
155.36, or construct a complete sanitary sewer system according to
specifications of the agency having jurisdiction.
   (D)   Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open
ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, and the
like, shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. Cross
drains at least 18 inches in diameter shall be provided to accommodate all
natural water flow; and they shall be of sufficient length and size to permit
full width roadways and the required slopes. The storm drainage system shall
meet the requirements of the City Engineer or the agency having jurisdiction.
   (E)   Electric supply system. Provisions shall be made in every subdivision
for a satisfactory electric supply system. Underground installation of all
necessary wires may be required by the Planning Commission.
   (F)   Provisions for street lighting shall be made in accordance to the
specifications of the City Engineer or County Engineer, whosoever has
jurisdiction, or the agency having jurisdiction.

155.99
SPECIAL USES AND VARIANCES
§ 155.70 MOBILE HOME PARKS.
   (A)   Mobile home parks shall be permitted only on Type I and II land. All
mobile home parks shall include lots for at least seven mobile homes, but shall
not be permitted on an area of less than one and one-half acres. The developer
shall be permitted to develop the park in stages as long as he complies with an
overall plan approved by the Planning Commission for the entire tract. The
number of mobile homes permitted in the mobile home park shall not exceed a
density of ten mobile homes per net acre. A net acre is that land to be
subdivided into lots after streets and other requirements and improvements have
been installed.
   (B)   The applicant for a mobile home park must submit a preliminary and
final plat in compliance with this chapter. The final plat shall also show the
following information:
      (1)   A plat of the entire park property.
      (2)   Subdivision of the property, including all streets, dimensions of
streets and lots, access to public streets, and public areas, such as visitors
parking spaces, recreational areas, swimming pools, and the like, if these
areas are proposed.
      (3)   Location and layout of all utilities, including pipe sizes, meter
locations, valves, fire hydrants, sanitary sewer connections, manholes, and
connections to the existing public utilities.
      (4)   Typical layout of one mobile home lot, showing mobile home
location, automobile parking spaces, patio, garbage can receptors, and the
like.
      (5)   Location of planting to be provided for landscaping purposes, or as
required for protective buffer.
   (C)   The Planning Commission may attach reasonable special conditions to
its approval of a mobile home park and may direct the Administrative Officer to
issue a building permit when the applicant presents a valid construction permit
from the State Department of Health, as required by KRS Chapter 219. The
Administrative Officer shall not issue the building permit until he has
received written authorization from the Planning Commission, or Board of
Adjustments where the Board has jurisdiction, and until the valid construction
permit is presented.
   (D)   The following standards shall apply to mobile homes located in mobile
home parks:
      (1)   Lot requirements. Individual lots within a mobile home park shall
not be less than 4,000 square feet in area if connected with a public sewer or
9,000 square feet if not connected with a public sewer. In no instance shall
more than one mobile home be permitted on a single lot. The minimum lot width
shall be 40 feet.
      (2)   Frontage. All mobile home parks shall front on a public street for
at least 100 feet.
      (3)   Setback. No mobile home or accessory building or structure shall be
located closer to any street than the minimum front yard setback for permanent
residential structures along the street. However, in no case shall minimum
setback be less than 30 feet.
      (4)   Spacing. No mobile home shall be located closer than 20 feet to
another mobile home.
      (5)   Accessory buildings. No accessory buildings or structures,
including patios, shall be located within five feet from any individual lot
line.
      (6)   Streets required. A roadway with a hard surface pavement at least
20 feet wide shall provide direct access to each mobile home lot. The area
occupied by the road shall not fulfill part of the area required for any lot.
All roads shall be designed to enable mobile homes entering the park to reverse
direction without having to back more than one mobile home length.
      (7)   Public access. Each mobile home park shall have at least one street
which gives access to a public street. The access street in either a single
mobile home park or adjoining parks shall not be less than 125 feet from an
intersection of two or more public streets.
      (8)   Parking. One paved automobile parking space shall be provided for
every mobile home lot, plus one additional parking space for each lot in the
mobile home park. This additional parking space may be placed in a central
location, but in no case shall the additional space be more than 150 feet from
the mobile home for which it is provided.
      (9)   Utilities. All lots within the mobile home park shall be provided
with water, sewer, and electrical facilities meeting the standards specified by
city, county, and state regulations. Each mobile home shall be properly
connected with these utilities.
      (10)   Drainage. Each mobile home lot and all streets shall be free from
flooding and shall be adequately drained so that no mobile home lot shall be
subject to the collection of storm water.
      (11)   Other conditions. The Planning Commission shall attach any other
conditions or requirements it deems necessary to ensure the proper development
of the mobile home park.
   (E)   These regulations contained in this section shall apply to the
expansion of any existing mobile home park, either present at the adoption of
this regulation or in the future.

155.99
§ 155.71 REDUCTION IN LOT SIZE WHERE LAND DEDICATED TO PUBLIC USE.
   (A)   A reduction in residential lot size and dimensions no greater than 10%
may be granted where lots are served by water and sewer lines if all the land
made available by this reduction is dedicated to public use for parks,
recreation, or other similar use. In no case can this additional land be used
for streets or vehicular right-of-way except when a part of the facilities
listed above. The primary use of this land shall be for the use and enjoyment
of those persons living or who live on the lots that were reduced in size
through the granting of this variance.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may grant this variance only on the condition
that the county, city, or other appropriate public body accept the land or area
in question. If the public body does not accept the area, a variance under this
section cannot be granted, and the plat cannot be filed with the County Clerk.
   (C)   Land in floodplains and other lands subject to flooding may be
dedicated to public use under this section, if the land can be used for public
use. Slopes of more than 15% but less than 35%, bodies of water, not including
rivers, and other extreme physical parcels can be dedicated to public use under
this section; however, the amount of land (or water surface) must be twice that
of the land made available by the reduction of lot size. Where land with a
slope greater than 35%, the land dedicated to public use must be three times
that land made available by the reduction of lot size. Additional land may be
required by the Planning Commission if land to be dedicated is not adequate for
public use.
   (D)   The land dedicated to public use must be greater than one-half acre,
and where water bodies are dedicated to public use, the water surface at a
normal pool level must be at least two acres. The land dedicated for public use
can be lessened if the land can be adequately used for park and recreation
purposes, but cannot be less than the land made available from the reduction of
lot sizes.
   (E)   Access to the land set aside for public use must be given from a
public street. Where bodies of water are dedicated to public use, adequate
shoreline must be given in order that the public may enjoy the use of these
areas.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71)
§ 155.72 CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Variances in the yard requirements of this chapter may be granted by
the Planning Commission where residential development so occurs that homes are
grouped within 100 feet from their front or side building line, around one
common point, or line, being either a common parking area or court area, except
that the total lot size of the sum of all lots cannot be reduced, nor can the
total area to remain in its natural state be reduced.
   (B)   The location of all structures shall be shown on final plans. The
proposed location and arrangement of structures shall not be detrimental to
existing or prospective development of the neighborhood. Open spaces between
structures shall be protected where necessary by adequate convenants running
with the land, conveyances, or dedications. There shall be no minimum lot size,
no minimum setback lines, no maximum percentage of lot coverage, and no minimum
lot width. However, every single-family dwelling shall have access to a public
street, court, walkway, or other area dedicated to public use. No single-family
dwelling, except in a townhouse, semi- detached dwelling, or an addition to any
single-family dwelling, shall be erected within a distance of less than 20 feet
from any other single-family dwelling.
   (C)   The land made available by cluster development shall be deeded to the
individual home owners in a rational manner, or, except for an area 25 feet
from any building, may be deeded to an appropriate government agency for
recreational use.
   (D)   Access to the land set aside for public use must be given from a
public street. Where bodies of water are dedicated to public use, adequate
shoreline must be given in order that the public may enjoy the use of the area.
   (E)   The Planning Commission shall have the power to review the building
sites in a cluster development and make necessary changes or add conditions
which it deems necessary.
   (F)   Where it is proposed that land be dedicated to public use, the
Planning Commission may grant this variance only on the condition that the
county, city, or other appropriate public body accept the land or area in
question. If the public body does not accept the area, a variance under this
section cannot be granted and the plat cannot be filed with the County Clerk.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.73 MULTI-BUILDING DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   A variance from this chapter may be granted for multi-building
development if it is shown that the land in question cannot be subdivided and
that more open space is created, a lower density can be established, traffic
problems are lessened, and a better relationship between the land and the
building is created by not subdividing the land. However, in no case shall the
Planning Commission grant a variance which does not comply with the zoning
code, where applicable, or which destroys the character of the neighborhood.
   (B)   Future subdivision of a multi-building development requires that all
lots and buildings meet the requirements of this chapter at the same time of
the subdivision.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71)
§ 155.74 UNUSUAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS.
   Where the Planning Commission finds that strict enforcement of these
regulations would create an undue hardship because of exceptional and unique
physical conditions that exist on the property to be subdivided, but not
usually found within the jurisdiction of ths city planning unit, the Planning
Commission may modify these regulations to the extent necessary to provided
relief from the undue hardship; provided, however, that this relief may be
granted without detriment to the public welfare and without substantially
impairing the intent and purpose of these regulations. In granting variances or
modifications, the Planning Commission may require those conditions as will
substantially secure the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied
or modified. Financial disadvantage to the property owner is no proof of
hardship within the purpose of these regulations.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71)
§ 155.75 VARIANCES IN CONFLICT WITH ZONING CODE.
   When a variance from this chapter is granted, and the variance is also a
variance from the zoning code, the variance shall only be granted by the
Planning Commission with the condition that the variance is granted by the
Board of Adjustments. An application for a variance shall first be considered
by the Planning Commission, and then by the Board of Adjustments. The Board of
Adjustments shall have jurisdiction only where the zoning code is in effect,
and shall follow the procedure set forth in the zoning code.
(Ord. 930.1, passed 3-15-71)
§ 155.98 REMEDIES.
   Any subdivider, County Court Clerk, public official, or other person who
does not comply with the zoning code, KRS Chapter 100, this chapter, or the
conditions set forth by the Planning Commission may, in addition to the penalty
set forth in §
155.99, be subject to the following action:
   (A)   The Planning Commission may apply for an injunction against any type
of subdivision construction by a subdivider or a landowner.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may direct the Administrative Officer not to
issue building permits in the subdivision in question.
(Ord. 930.l, passed 3-15-71)
§ 155.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   The Planning Commission may take action to fine any person or entity
who is in violation of these provisions or any of the regulations adopted
hereunder for which no other penalty is provided. Except as provided in
division (B), the person or entity shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall,
upon conviction, be fined not less than $10 but not more than $500 for each
violation. Each day a violation shall continue shall constitute a separate
offense.
   (B)   Any person shall upon conviction be fined not less than $100 but not
more than $500 for each lot or parcel which was the subject of sale or transfer
or a contract for sale or transfer where such sale or transfer, or contract
therefor, constitutes a violation of these subdivision regulations.

§ 156.01 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.
   The intent of the Hazard Downtown Incentives Program (hereinafter referred
to as the "HDIP" or the "Program") is to create a downtown with culture,
tourism, and community value by providing financial incentives and assistance
to aid developing new business, retention of current businesses and to preserve
the historic downtown buildings. It is the goal of the HDIP to be provide a
broad range of incentives to various economic actors including property owners,
new businesses, and existing businesses. All incentives in this section will be
limited to the Downtown as defined below.
(Ord. 2020-06, passed 12-18-19)

   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "CITY." City of Hazard, Kentucky.
   "COMMERCIAL PROPERTY." Any property located in the Downtown area, regardless
of current use, that will be used for commercial purposes.
   "DOWNTOWN." The areas of Main Street, High Street and Memorial Drive,
including all streets adjacent to these areas, are the primary focus of the
incentives. This area is known as the "B-1 Downtown Business District" on city
zoning maps. North Main Street to the Walker Town Bridge and East Main Street
to the Woodland Park Bridge will be considered in the Downtown area but will be
secondary to the primary areas of focus.
   "DOWNTOWN COORDINATOR." An employee assigned to oversee the HDIP.
   "FACADE." An individual storefront or side of a building that faces a public
street or public alley with public access. Separate addresses within a single
building may qualify as separate facades.
   "HDIP COMMITTEE." A committee that has final approval over all incentives,
consisting of the Downtown Coordinator, City Manager and city's Chief Financial
Officer.
   "HDIP ACCOUNT." The financial account to be established as a depository of
all funds dedicated to the HDIP program.
   "HISTORIC BUILDING." Per Kentucky law, a building of a certain age or a
building that may have cultural or aesthetic value.
   "REHABILITATION." The process of returning an existing structure to a state
of utility through repair or alteration which makes possible an efficient
contemporary use.
   "TARGET BUSINESS." Business types which are targeted for the purposes of
creating a healthy mix of diverse businesses in Downtown based, in part, on the
businesses located in the district at any given time. These business types will
be determined at least annually by the Downtown Coordinator with approval from
the City Manager.
(Ord. 2020-06, passed 12-18-19)
§ 156.03 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Administration. The City Commission will direct the program under the
administration of the Downtown Coordinator. The various duties required for
this administration may be done through action of the entire HDIP Committee or
newly created committees of the HDIP.
   (B)   Financial resources available to the HDIP.
      (1)   The City Commission may, from time to time as it deems appropriate,
allocate funds to the HDIP to be used to provide financial assistance to
eligible business concerns through the various incentives and grants listed
below. These funds shall be discretionary city dollars approved by the City
Manager and private donations. The funds will be transferred from the city to
the HDIP account upon the City Commission's or City Manager's request.
      (2)   The HDIP will establish a separate account, the HDIP account, for
all financial transactions executed under the HDIP.
      (3)   In general, all grants and incentives resulting in payments made to
recipients from the HDIP account will be reimbursements. Grantees must present
receipts, invoices, or other proof of payment of eligible expenses prior to
reimbursement. The HDIP will be responsible for maintaining these records for
ten years. Reimbursements will be made to the recipients within 60 days of the
presentation of appropriate documentation.
      (4)   If the HDIP Committee wishes to pay in advance for some portion of
a grant other than those that reimburse for utility fees or other city
services, a request may be made to the City Manager for authorization to
proceed. A record of this approval must be maintained for ten years.

Downtown Coordinator.
   (A)   The Downtown Coordinator will perform a preliminary review of the

eligible under the terms of the program and have produced the required
documentation established by the HDIP. The applicant will be notified by the
Downtown Coordinator of any deficiencies in the application.
   (B)   The Downtown Coordinator will then review which grants or incentives
are being requested and will verify that there are adequate resources budgeted

Commissioners to consider in the appeal. The appeal will be filed with the City
Clerk to be presented to the City Commissioners for a vote at the next regular
city meeting. The applicant submitting the appeal is not required to attend the
city meeting but may do so if they wish. The results of any such appeal will be
honored by the HDIP.
   (F)   The HDIP may issue final approval to any provisionally approved
application once sufficient funds have been placed into the HDIP Account, if

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.001 TITLE.
   This chapter is entitled and may be referred to as the zoning code.
(Ord. 920.1, passed - - )
§ 157.002 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the general welfare by
establishing the regulating zoning districts throughout the city for the
specific purposes detailed in KRS 100.201. In establishing the zoning
districts, this chapter seeks the general welfare by designating sufficient
space for all necessary uses of land, by protecting the permitted uses in each
district from the undesirable effects of conflicting uses, and by ensuring the
stable value of all permitted development. This chapter further seeks the
general welfare by protecting the efficiency and encouraging the improvement of
traffic circulation and access to the land in all districts in order that daily
travel and commerce may increase in safety and may be carried forth with a
minimum of delay for the benefit of all activities and persons in the city.

access points to the arterial streets serving all zoning districts shall be
located no more frequently than once every one-quarter of a mile. Topography
and traffic volumes shall determine the exact locations. Heavy arterial traffic
volumes demand greater access spacing. Along any arterial street where
subdivided land and its minor streets are not sufficiently developed to permit
acceptably spaced access points, the Planning Commission may approve the
platting of temporary access points and may require that temporary access
points be eliminated by the developer when minor streets or marginal access
streets are extended to the approved permanent access points. These

construction only.
   (B)   No part of a yard required for any building may be included as
fulfilling the yard requirements for an adjacent building.
   (C)   Within the area defined by the intersection of any two right- of-way
lines of streets or a street and railroad and a straight line intersecting
those two right-of-way lines at points 30 feet from their intersection, no
obstructions to vision between a height of 3-1/2 feet and ten feet above the

permitted in rear or side yards according to the dimension and area regulations
contained in the appendix to this chapter.
(Ord. 920.1, passed - - ) Penalty, see §

Officer's certificate approving proposed and completed water and sewage
facilities must accompany applications for building permits and certificates of
occupancy.
(Ord. 920.1, passed - - ) Penalty, see §
157.999
§ 157.022 HEIGHT OF BUILDINGS.
   The height regulations contained in this chapter apply to buildings and
portions of buildings occupied regularly by human beings. Unless otherwise
provided, they do not apply to structures or portions of buildings such as
radio towers, silos, and flag poles, which are not regularly occupied by human
beings except for maintenance. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall interpret
whether the height regulations apply whenever there is doubt.
(Ord. 920.1, passed - - ) Penalty, see §
157.999
§ 157.023 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (A)   Existing off-street parking provided for any building or use at the
time of adoption of this chapter shall not thereafter be reduced if the
reduction results in parking area less than that required by this chapter. Any
existing building or use not provided with conforming parking space shall be
provided with off-street parking space in conformance with this chapter at the
time of expansion of the use.
   (B)   When any building is built or any use of land is initiated, there
shall be provided sufficient off-street parking space on the premises so that
no automobile parking on any street will result from the normal activity. If
the off-street parking capacity is exceeded and street parking is generated
more often than six times during a six- month period, this shall be considered
as resulting from normal activity and additional off-street parking shall be
provided. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall interpret the amount of parking
space required for any building or use, assisted by the following standards,
whenever the Administrative Officer is unable to apply the following standards
literally or determine a parking space deficiency according to the standard
above. In either case, he shall apply to the Board for an original
interpretation.
   (C)   For the purpose of this chapter, an off-street parking space shall
consist of a space adequate for parking an automobile with room for opening
doors on both sides, together with properly related access to a public street
or alley and maneuvering room. Required off-street parking areas for three or
more automobiles shall have individual spaces marked and shall be so designed,
maintained, and regulated that no parking or maneuvering incidental to parking
shall be on any public street, walk, or alley, and so that any automobile may
be parked and
!missing material
   (D)   Off-street parking space required for any building or use may be
detached from but located within walking distance of 400 feet from the premises
it serves, and may be consolidated into a large parking area serving other
buildings and uses if approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The
Administrative Officer shall apply to the Board for an original interpretation
when building permits are requested in these cases. The Board may not authorize
the total amount of parking space required for all buildings and uses to be
diminished except as follows. If a consolidated parking area serves buildings
or uses which do not generate automobile parking at the same times, such as
churches and stores, total parking space may be diminished to the maximum
required by those buildings and uses which do generate the parking of
automobiles at the same time.
   (E)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment may require a plat, deed, and any other
proof necessary to show that required parking space, if located off the
premises it serves, is controlled by and available to the applicant for a
building permit.
   (F)   Parking spaces and the access thereto shall be surfaced in a manner
adequate to eliminate dust and mud.
(Ord. 920.1, passed - - ) Penalty, see §
157.999
§ 157.024 OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING SPACES.

   (A)   The zoning map referred to in this chapter is entitled the “Zoning Map
for Hazard, Kentucky,” and may be referred to as the zoning map. The zoning map
is hereby made a part of this chapter. There is on file with the City Clerk one
copy of the zoning map and text, comprising together the official zoning code
for the city. A certified copy of the zoning map and text are on file with the
Planning Commission.
   (B)   The following rules shall be used to interpret the exact location of
the zoning district boundaries shown on the zoning map:
      (1)   Where a zoning district boundary follows a street or railroad
right-of-way, that right-of-way is the boundary of the district.
      (2)   Where a zoning district boundary approximately follows a lot or
boundary line, the line is the boundary of the district.
      (3)   Where a zoning district boundary follows a stream or the shore of a
body of water, that stream or shoreline is the boundary of the district.
      (4)   Where a zoning district boundary does not clearly follow any of the
features mentioned in divisions (1) through (3) above, its exact location on
the ground shall be determined by measurement according to the map scale. If
the area in question was delineated by amendment to this chapter, the wording
of the amendment as recorded in the official minutes of the Board of
Commissioners shall define the boundary or boundaries in question.
      (5)   In any case where the exact location of a boundary is still not
clear, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall use these rules to determine the
exact location upon application by the Administrative Officer for an original
interpretation.

      (2)   Planned commercial subdivisions including shopping malls, shopping
centers, or other retail or wholesale commercial activities of similar density
or complexity.
      (3)   Planned light or heavy industrial subdivisions or industrial parks.
   (B)   Conditional uses. The following uses shall be permitted as conditional
uses in this district: Those conditional uses permitted for similar districts
by this chapter, subject to approval of the Planning Commission. For example,
residential district conditional uses for planned residential development
projects. In addition thereto, any activity constituting a prohibited use
within the provisions of division (I) below may be allowed as a conditional
use, on a temporary basis only, if essential to the implementation of the
planned development project. Uses not permitted within the overall district in
which the Planned-Development project is located shall not be permitted in the
Planned-Development project within such district.
   (C)   A planned-development project may be allowed in those zoning districts
where it is designated as a permitted use under the zoning district regulations
or may be permitted in any district after an amendment to the zoning map. A
minimum of three acres is required for a planned-development project. A
planned-development project may be under single or divided ownership. The uses
of premises and development densities in a planned-development project shall
conform with the permitted uses and densities of the zoning district in which
it is located when it is permitted. If a planned-development project is
proposed which includes uses or densities that are not permitted in any zoning
district, the project may be permitted after approval by the Planning
Commission.
   (D)   When a planned-development project is proposed, the procedure for
subdivision approval as set forth in
Chapter 155 shall be followed in its entirety even though the ownership of land
may not be divided. A preliminary plat and final plat, both approved by the
Planning Commission, shall be required for every planned-development project.
The Planning Commission may establish a schedule of fees to be charged for plat
review. The project shall be developed according to the approved final plat.
Building permits and certificates of occupancy shall be required for each
building according to §§
157.101 and
157.102 respectively.
   (E)   The initial final plat of a planned-development project shall comprise
at least four acres and shall show the proposed design for development and use
of that entire project area. A project may thereafter be expanded on adjacent
land according to the planned- development or subdivision procedure, as
applicable, with no minimum acreage requirement, provided the expansion is for
the same principal use as the initial four-acre development and may be
incorporated as an integral extension of the original plan. The effect of a
planned- development project on surrounding uses and the recommendations of all
officially adopted plans shall be considered in determining the approval or
disapproval of a project.
   (F)   When a tract of land of less than four acres is under one ownership
and that owner has owned no adjoining land at any time since the effective date
of this chapter, the tract may be platted as a planned-development project or
subdivision if, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, the development
will not be harmful to surrounding property, the applicable plan or plans of
this area, and the intent of this chapter.
   (G)   Dimension and area regulations. The regulations on the dimensions and
area for lots and structures are set forth in the schedule of dimension and
area regulations contained in the appendix to this chapter. The applicable
regulations shall be observed in all planned-development districts, according
to the type of development in the planned-development district. Although it is
permissible to depart from literal conformance with the individual lot
dimension and area regulations, there shall be no diminution of total
equivalent lot area, parking area, or loading and unloading area requirements
that would be necessary for the equivalent amount of individual lot
development. However, the Planning Commission may allow reductions in these
requirements if the developer can satisfactorily prove that large-scale
development may permit these reductions without destroying the intent of these
regulations.
   (H)   The Planning Commission shall attach reasonable special conditions to
ensure that there shall be no departure from the intent of this zoning code.
The planned-development project shall conform with all of these conditions.
Because a planned-development project is inherently more complex than
individual lot development and because each project must be tailored to the
topography and neighboring uses, the standards for these projects cannot be
inflexible. The Planning Commission shall attach special conditions based on
the following standards in addition to imposing the standards for total area,
parking area, and loading and unloading area. The Planning Commission may also
attach any other reasonable special conditions.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall require the dedication or reservation
of right-of-way, as authorized by
Chapter 155, to provide access to interior land in planned-development
districts. All access to arterial streets serving planned-development districts
shall be approved according to the following standards. It is desirable that
access points to all arterial streets shall be located no more frequently than
once every one eighth to one quarter of a mile. The Planning Commission may
approve the platting of temporary access points in conformance with §
157.005.
      (2)   Wherever there is an abrupt change in uses, such as from
residential use to commercial use, it is desirable that a buffer area of open
space or protective planting be placed between the uses which will protect each
use from the undesirable effects of the other.
      (3)   Parking and other public areas used at night shall be adequately
lighted, and private areas shall be adequately protected from this lighting and
any other lighting from public areas. Public streets may also require
protection from excessive glare from lighted areas.
   (I)   Uses prohibited. Uses which, in the opinion of the Board of Zoning
Adjustment, would be detrimental to the character and use of the property as a
planned-development district such as commercial or industrial development
within a planned residential development or residential or commercial
development within a planned industrial development. In cases of a planned
residential R-1, R-2, or R-3 or planned commercial B-1, B-2, or B-
3 development, uses prohibited shall include specifically but not be limited
to:
      (1)   Any manufacturing or processing establishment that creates
excessive dust, smoke, noise, or offensive odor outside the lot on which it is
located and which employs more than ten persons, including the owner or
operator; or
      (2)   Any on-site activity for the exploration or development of oil,
natural gas, coal, or other minerals such as drilling, storage, mining
(surface, auger, pit, underground, or in-situ), blasting, loading, or
transporting of oil, gas, coal, or other minerals except over or through roads
forming a part of the official state coal road system approved by the Kentucky
Transportation Cabinet pursuant to KRS 42.455(7) or pipelines used for
interstate transmission of gas if such pipelines are lawfully pre-existing as
of the effective date of Ord. 88-6 or located in the future within federal,
state, or city rights-of-way.

or alteration fails to conform, the Administrative Officer shall refuse to
issue a building permit and shall deliver written notice to the applicant

more than two of whom may be citizen members of the Planning Commission.
Members shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to the approval of the Board
of Commissioners. Each member shall be appointed for a period of four years,
but the term of office of members first appointed shall be staggered so that a
proportionate number serve one, two, three, and four years respectively.
   (B)   Members of the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be removed from office
by the Mayor, subject to the approval of the Board of Commissioners, for
inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or conflict of interest upon
written charges and after public hearing, as provided in KRS 100.217(8).
   (C)   Vacancies on the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be filled within 60
days by the Mayor, subject to the approval of the Board of Commissioners. If

vacancy. When a vacancy occurs other than through expiration of the term of
office, it shall be filled for the remainder of that term.
   (D)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall have the following powers:

there is error in any order, requirement, decision, grant, or refusal made by
the Administrative Officer in the enforcement of the zoning code. An appeal
shall be taken within 30 days, as provided by KRS 100.257.
      (2)   Conditional use permits. The Board shall have the power to hear and
decide applications for conditional uses in conformance with §
157.104, pursuant to KRS 100.237.
      (3)   Variances. Pursuant to KRS 100.241, the Board shall have the power
to hear and decide on applications for variances as provided in § 157.105.
(Ord. 920.l, passed - - )
§ 157.104 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   An applicant shall submit an application for a conditional use permit
to the Administrative Officer and the applicant shall follow all procedures set
forth in this section and KRS 100.237. The Administrative Officer shall refer
the application to the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The Board of Zoning
Adjustment is authorized by KRS 100.237 to grant, modify, or deny a conditional
use permit. Other regulations for conditional use permits are as follows.
   (B)   The Board may attach necessary conditions such as time limitations,
requirements that one or more things be done before the request can be
initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature. Any conditions shall be
recorded in the Board's minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a
reference to the specific section in this zoning code listing the conditional
use under consideration. The Board shall have the power to revoke conditional
use permits, or variance for noncompliance with the condition thereof.
Furthermore, the Board shall have a right of action to compel offending
structures of uses removed at the cost of the violator and may have judgment in
personam, for such cost.
   (C)   The granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant
from complying with all the requirements of this chapter and other ordinances
and regulations of the city.
   (D)   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within the time limit set by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, or within one
year, if no specific time limit has been set, the conditional use permit shall
not revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing.
"Exercised," as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts
for the construction of the main building or other improvement have been let;
or in the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is
under construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions
involving substantial investment under contract, in development, are completed.
When construction is not a part of the use, "exercised" shall mean that the use
is in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.
   (E)   The Administrative Officer shall review all conditional use permits,
except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least
once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where
the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is
complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use
permit. If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on
the conditional use permit, the Administrative Officer shall report the fact in
writing to the Chairperson of the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The report shall
state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the
conditions on the conditional use permit, and a copy of the report shall be
furnished to the landowner at the same time that it is furnished to the
Chairperson of the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The Board shall hold a hearing
on the report within a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one week prior to the
hearing. If the Board of Zoning Adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the
report of the Administrative Officer are true and that the landowner has taken
no steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the
hearing, the Board of Zoning Adjustment may authorize the Administrative
Officer to revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal
action to cause the termination of the activity on the land which the
conditional use permit authorizes.
   (F)   Once the Board of Zoning Adjustment has completed a conditional use
permit and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be
completely and permanently satisfied, the Administrative Officer, upon request
of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the
conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts which indicate that the
conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of
the conditional use permit which is on file. Thereafter the conditional use, if
it continues to meet the other requirements of the regulations, will be treated
as a permitted use.
   (G)   When an application is made for a conditional use permit for land
located within or abutting any residential zoning district, written notice
shall be given at least 14 days in advance of the public hearing on the
application to the applicant, Administrative Officer, an owner of every parcel
of property adjoining the property to which the application applies, and such
other persons as this zoning code, regulations, or Board of Zoning Adjustment
bylaws shall direct. Written notice shall be by first class mail with
certification by the Board's secretary or other officer that the notice was
mailed. It shall be the duty of the applicant to furnish to the Board the name
and address of an owner of each parcel of property as described in this
division. Records maintained by the property valuation administrator may be
relied upon to determine the identity and address of the owner. In the event
such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, then the
person notified by mail shall be the president or chairperson of the owner
group which administers property commonly owned by the condominium or
cooperative owners.
(Ord. 920.1, passed - - )
§ 157.105 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide
on applications for variances. The Board may impose any reasonable conditions
or restrictions on any variance it decides to grant.
(KRS 100.241)
   (B)   Before any variance is granted, the Board must find that the granting
of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or
welfare, will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will
not cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public, and will not allow an
unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In
making these findings, the Board shall consider whether:
      (1)   The requested variance arises from special circumstances which do
not generally apply to land in the general vicinity, or in the same zone;
      (2)   The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an
unnecessary hardship on the applicant; and
      (3)   The circumstances are the result of actions of the applicant taken
subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is
sought.
   (C)   The Board shall deny any request for a variance arising from
circumstances that are the result of wilful violations of the zoning regulation
by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which
relief is sought.
(KRS 100.243)
   (D)   A variance applies to the property for which it is granted, and not to
the individual who applied for it. A variance runs with the land and is
transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be transferred by
the applicant to a different site.
(KRS 100.251)
   (E)   Public notice and notice to adjoining property owners shall be given
in the same manner as that required in §
157.104 for conditional use applications.
(Ord. 920.1, passed - - )
§ 157.106 APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be taken by any person or
entity claiming to be injuriously affected or aggrieved by an official action,
order, requirement, interpretation, grant, refusal, or decision of the
Administrative Officer. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the
appellant or his agent receives notice of the action appealed from, by filing
with the Administrative Officer and with the Board a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof, and giving notice of the appeal to any and all
parties of record. The Administrative Officer shall immediately transmit to the
Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken and shall be treated as and be the respondent in all further
proceedings. At any hearing by the Board, any interested person may appear and
enter his appearance and all shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The
Board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give public notice
in accordance with KRS Chapter 424, as well as written notice to the appellant,
any and all other parties of record, the Administrative Officer, and property
owners within 100 feet of the property in question at least one week prior to
the hearing, and shall decide it within 60 days. The affected party may appear
at the hearing in person or by attorney. The Board shall charge a nonrefundable
fee as specified in the bylaws.
(Ord. 920.1, passed - - )
§ 157.998 REMEDIES.
   If any building is erected, constructed, reconstructed, repaired, converted,
or maintained or any building, structure, or land is used in violation of this
zoning code, the Administrative Officer, any other appropriate authority, or
any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be damaged by the
violation, in addition to other remedies may institute an injunction, mandamus,
or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent the occupancy of the
building, structure, or land.
(Ord. 920.1, passed - - )
§ 157.999 PENALTY.
   (A) Except as provided in division (B), any person who violates any
provision of this zoning code shall be guilty of a violation and fined in
accordance with §
99.18 of the Hazard Code Enforcement Board Ordinance. Each day a violation
shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B) Any person shall upon conviction be fined not less than $100 but no more
than $500 for each lot or parcel which was the subject of sale or transfer or a
contract for sale or transfer where such sale or transfer, or contract
therefor, constitutes a violation of this zoning code.
   (C)   Violation of this chapter shall constitute a civil offense which shall
be enforced according to the procedures set forth in the Hazard Code
Enforcement Board Ordinance by the Code Enforcement Board, hearing officers,
code enforcement officers, citation officers and other persons duly authorized
to investigate and enforce the violations through investigation, inspection and
issuance of citations.

any federal or state urban renewal or redevelopment program or economic or
community development initiative to the extent the same may now or hereinafter
be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. 2002-10, passed 7-1-02)
§ 159.05 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW.
   (A)   Powers and Duties of the Board. The Board shall exercise only those
powers and duties granted by this chapter and those powers and duties which may
be assigned to it at a later time by the City Commission. As noted hereinafter,
the Board shall not consider interior arrangement or use, but shall consider
the historical and architectural qualities of the exterior of buildings and
other structures and the relationship of those buildings and structures to
others in the district so as to avoid incongruity and promote harmony
therewith. It is intended that this chapter shall be interpreted consistently
with the provisions of
Chapter 150 Building Regulations and
Chapter 151 Flood Damage Prevention Code and other sections of this code
regulating building construction, maintenance and land usage. Nothing contained
in this chapter should be construed in any manner which would disqualify the
city or individual properties from participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program or under any federal or state programs for public housing,
community or urban redevelopment or economic development.
   (B)   Meetings. The Board shall hold its meetings at regularly scheduled
times or at the call of the Building Inspector, the Board chairman or any two

and approve or disapprove individual applications (other than applications to
create historic districts) to the Building Inspector who may review and grant
or deny such applications without public hearing and formal action by the

may be subject to appeal to the Board as hereinafter provided. The Board may
also exercise its discretion to appoint one or more hearing officers from time
to time to conduct any adjudicative type proceeding and to make recommended
findings of fact or conclusions of law to assist the Board in the conduct of
its duties.
(Ord. 2002-10, passed 7-1-02)
§ 159.06 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   When Required. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required
before a person or entity may undertake any exterior alterations on a property
or structure or prior to the initiation of any new construction or the
demolition of all or any part of any building or structure on any premises in a
historic district except as otherwise noted herein. Recurring maintenance which
does not require issuance of a building permit under §
157.101 may be undertaken without a certificate provided the work involves
repairs to existing features of a building or the replacement of elements of a
building with identical pieces which will not alter the exterior appearance and
historic character of the building. Furthermore, nothing contained in this
chapter is intended to mandate that existing non-contributing structures be
brought into compliance. The Building Inspector may determine that an
application for building permit is for alterations to a structure which is an
existing non-contributing structure and that such application is otherwise
exempt from the requirements of this section. However, applications for
building permits for existing non- contributing structures nevertheless shall
be reviewed to determine that new additions or modifications do not cause
further negative impact on the historic character of the district, and, in the
event of general renovation or restoration of any existing non-contributing
Structure costing 50% or more of the total fair market value of the structure,
the Board may require the applicant to reincorporate historic design elements
to the extent reasonably practicable in the Board's discretion.
   (B)   Standard for Review of Applications. In its review of the material
submitted in support of an application for a certificate the Board (or the
Building Inspector, if applicable) shall examine the architectural design and
the exterior surface treatment of the proposed construction on the site in
question and its relationship to other structures within the area, the
relationship of the proposed construction to the design of the building, and
other pertinent factors affecting the appearance and efficient functioning of
the historic district or individual landmarks contained therein. The Board's
authority shall extend to any material exterior changes including, but not
limited to, painting previously unpainted masonry, sandblasting wood or masonry
or repainting of masonry walls. In all instances, however, the Board shall
regulate only those outside surfaces of a building which can be viewed from the
primary or secondary street or other right of way which is contiguous with the
structure. Interior arrangements shall not be considered, and no requirements
shall be imposed except for the purpose of preventing development incongruous
in scale, design or materials to the historic or architectural aspects of the
district or landmark. In reviewing proposals, the Board shall refer to the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings as currently or hereinafter in effect, and
the Board shall comply with the design guidelines and criteria adopted by the
Historic Preservation Commission.
   (C)   Procedure. A certificate may be issued by the Board (or by the
Building Inspector if applicable) in accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   Filing. In the event that information submitted with an application
for building permit is deemed insufficient to enable a determination under this
section, the Board may require the submission to the Building Inspector of any
or all of the following additional items: architectural plans, plot plans,
landscaping plans, plans for off-street parking, plans for signs, building
elevations, photographs, or prospective drawings depicting the proposed
structure with existing adjoining or nearby structures which are substantially
related to it visually or by reason of function, traffic generation or other
characteristics. In such event, the applicant shall not be deemed to have
completed an application for certificate until such specific information is
submitted.
      (2)   Issuance of Certificates by the Building Inspector. The Building
Inspector shall issue no building permit which would result in the demolition,
alteration or construction of all or any part of a structure (other than
existing non-contributing Structures) within a historic district unless and
until a certificate has been approved or a determination has been made that no
certificate is required. In order to expedite disposition of routine
applications for exterior changes, the Board may define and delegate such items
to the responsibility of the Building Inspector by adoption of public
guidelines or policies to delineate permissible areas of responsibility. Upon
his review of such information as may be submitted with an application, and
upon determination that all requirements of the guidelines have been met, the
Building Inspector shall approve or disapprove the application. At any time,
the Building Inspector may elect to defer action upon a pending application and
to refer any application to the full Board for review and a hearing. Any person
aggrieved by any determination to issue or disapprove an application to issue a
certificate may appeal to the Board as provided hereinafter.
      (3)   Certificates for Demolition. The specific criteria for issuance of
certificates for demolition of structures (other than existing non-contributing
structures) on any parcel within a historic district shall be as follows:
         (a)   If the application is for demolition of an addition, for a
portion of a building or for an accessory structure which is not significant to
the principal structure, site, landmark or the historic district, and the
approval of the application would not adversely affect the remaining parts of
the structure, site, landmark or the historic district which are significant,
the Building Inspector may review and approve issuance of the certificate.
         (b)   In all other cases, the Board shall conduct a public hearing
concerning the application, and may approve the issuance of the certificate
only if the application is for the demolition or moving of a building (or
portion thereof) which does not contribute to the character of and will not
adversely affect the character or the remainder of the historic district, or,
alternatively, if no reasonable economic return can be realized from the
property without the demolition, and the denial of the application would result
in the taking of the property without just compensation. The applicant shall
bear the burden of proving that a taking without compensation would occur, and
the Board may require the applicant to produce all relevant information
concerning the property and its value including but not limited to, date(s) of
purchase and amount(s) paid for the property and the relationships, if any,
between buyer and seller; gross income and cash flow from income producing
property; operating and maintenance expenses; assessed value for tax purposes;
annual debt service; appraisals; real estate listings for sale or rent and
terms and conditions of offers made or received; and consideration for
profitable and/or reasonable adaptive uses for the property in lieu of
demolition.
      (4)   Notice of Hearing. In the event that a public hearing before the
Board is deemed necessary prior to approval or disapproval of an application,
notice of the time and place of the hearing and its purpose shall be given by
publication in the newspaper in accordance with KRS Chapter 424 and additional
notice shall be provided to the record owner of adjacent properties via
certified mail at the address listed for such owner in the property tax records
of the city.
      (5)   Hearings. All public hearings conducted before the Board on
applications for certificates shall be conducted in the same manner and
utilizing the same procedures as hearings before the Board of Appeals under §
150.20. The Board shall vote to approve or disapprove all or part of any
application for certificate within 30 days after the hearing is finally
completed. The Building Inspector shall promptly issue any certificate if
approved by the Board during any hearing or take such additional steps to
implement or enforce the Board's other determination, if any, as may be
required.
      (6)   Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board on an
application for certificate (including any appeals from actions of the Building
Inspector) may appeal the decision of the Board in the same manner prescribed
for appeals from the Board of Appeals under § 150.02.

   There is created a Historic Preservation Committee for the city to consist
of the Mayor and four other members to be appointed by the Board of
Commissioners for staggered terms of one, two and three years as determined by
the Board of Commissioners. The Committee shall periodically review this
chapter and other activities of the Board of Commissioners, and shall work in

§ 160.03 CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY AS ABANDONED URBAN PROPERTY; RIGHT TO
APPEAL.
   (A)   The City Building Inspector shall each year make an initial
determination of which properties in the city are abandoned urban properties
and shall prepare and furnish a list of abandoned and urban properties located
in the City to the City Clerk and the Code Enforcement Board prior to June 1 of
each year.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided herein, a property classified by the city
as abandoned urban property as of January 1 shall be taxed as abandoned urban
property for such tax year. If the owner repairs, rehabilitates or otherwise
returns the property to productive use so that the property is no longer
abandoned urban property, the owner shall notify the City Building Inspector,
which shall, if he finds the property is no longer abandoned urban property,
notify the City Clerk, the Code Enforcement Board and the Perry County
Valuation Administrator to strike the property from the list of abandoned urban
properties as of the succeeding January 1.
   (C)   No later than July 1 of each year, the city shall mail by first class
mail, to the owner(s) of each abandoned urban property, as those name(s) are
listed in the records of the City Clerk and the Property Valuation
Administrator, a notice that the property has been classified as abandoned
urban property. The owner of any abandoned urban property who believes that
his, her or its property has been incorrectly classified may appeal such
classification to the city's Code Enforcement Board which shall determine
whether the property is blighted or deteriorated and certify its result to the
City Commission. Such appeal shall be in writing, and shall be made no later
than August 1 of that year. The procedures for the hearing shall be those
procedures in place for other hearings before the Code Enforcement Board. If
the Code Enforcement Board finds that the property was incorrectly classified
as abandoned urban property, it shall cause the property to be removed from the
list of properties so classified. After September 1 of each year, and in the
event the owner of any abandoned urban property does not appeal the
determination, the Code Enforcement Board shall certify the properties as
blighted or deteriorated to the Board of Commissioners of the City of Hazard
and the Perry County Valuation Administrator.
   (D)   The Code Enforcement Board established pursuant to KRS 65.8801 to
65.8839 is assigned the duties of a Vacant Properties Review Commission created
pursuant to KRS 99.700 through 99.730 as may be amended from time to time.
      (1)   The Code Enforcement Board shall be responsible for carrying out
the functions and responsibilities concerning blighted and deteriorated
properties, as granted by state statute and shall have the powers, duties and
authority granted it by the Kentucky Revised Statues and the code of ordinances
of the city as amended from time to time.
      (2)   The Code Enforcement Board's duties shall be to certify properties
as abandoned, blighted or deteriorated to the City Commission; and to timely
hear appeals from owners of properties that have been determined to be
abandoned, blighted or deteriorated urban property.
      (3)   Any interested party may appeal the Code Enforcement Board's
decision to the Perry County District Court. Appeals from determinations by the
Code Enforcement Board shall be taken in the same manner and at the same time
as other appeals.

§ 160.04 EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners of the city may institute eminent domain
proceedings in accordance with the provisions of KRS Chapter 416 against any
property, and may through such proceedings acquire any property, which has been
certified as blighted or deteriorated by the Code Enforcement Board if it
finds:
      (1)   That the property has deteriorated to such an extent as to
constitute a serious and growing menace to the public health, safety, and
welfare;
      (2)   That such property is likely to continue to deteriorate unless
corrected;
      (3)   That the continued deterioration of such property may contribute to
the blighting or deterioration of the area immediately surrounding the
property; and
      (4)   That the owner of such property has failed to correct the
deterioration of the property.
   (B)   The findings required as above set forth shall be included in any
order or resolution of the Board of Commissioners authorizing the institution
of eminent domain proceedings.
(Ord. 2018-05, passed 9-18-17; Am. Ord., passed 6-18-18)

with the foregoing provisions, shall have the power to hold, clear, manage,
redevelop or dispose of property so acquired pursuant to the provisions of KRS
99.700 to 99.730. "Redevelop" or "Redevelopment" means the planning or
replanning, design or redesign, acquisition, clearance, development, and
disposal or any combination of these, of a property in the preparation of such
property for residential, commercial, public, or related uses, as may be
appropriate or necessary.

§ 160.06 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   No officer or employee of the city, or the Code Enforcement Board, who in
the course of employment duties is required to participate in the determination
of property blight or deterioration or the issuance of notices of violations
which may lead to a determination of blight or deterioration, shall acquire any
interest in any property declared by the Board or the City Commission to be
blighted or deteriorated. If any such officer or employee owns or has financial
interest, directly or indirectly, in any property certified to be blighted of
deteriorated, he or she shall immediately disclose in writing, such interest to
the Board and the City Commission, and that disclosure shall be entered into
the minutes of the Board and the City Commission. Failure to so disclose such
interest shall constitute misconduct in office. No payment shall be made to any
officer or employee for any property or interest therein acquired by the city
from such officer or employee unless the amount of payment is fixed by court
order and eminent domain proceeding or unless payment is unanimously approved
by the City Commission.
