Enforcement Board or hearing officer to contest the citation; the determination
that the violation was committed shall be final; the citation as issued shall

   (F)   (1)   The person to whom the citation is issued shall respond to the
citation within seven days of the date of issuance by either paying the civil
fine or requesting, in writing, a hearing to contest the citation. If the
person fails to respond to the citation within seven days, the person shall be
deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a
violation was committed shall be considered final. In this event, the citation
as issued shall be deemed a final order determining that the violation was
committed and imposing the civil fine as set forth in the citation, and the
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order to
District Court.
      (2)   Notice of the final order shall be delivered to the cited violator
by regular first-class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; personal
delivery; or by leaving a copy of the order at the person's usual place of
residence with any individual residing therein who is 18 years of age or older

fine set forth in the citation, and the alleged violator shall be deemed to
have waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court.
      (2)   Notice of a final order shall be provided to the cited violator by

   (E)   The assigned hearing officer shall, based on the evidence, determine
whether a violation was committed. If it is determined that no violation was
committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered. If it is
determined that a violation was committed, an order may be issued upholding the
citation. The Board or hearing officer may impose a fine up to the maximum
authorized by ordinance or require the offender to remedy a continuing
violation to avoid a fine, or both.

writing, which shall include the findings and conclusions reached and the date
the order was issued. A copy shall be furnished to the person named in the

§ 35.75 REMOVAL OR REDUCTION IN GRADE.
   (A)   No member of the Police or Fire Departments shall be removed from the
department or reduced in grade for any reason except inefficiency, misconduct,
insubordination or violation of law, or violation of the rules adopted for the
departments. Any person may prefer charges against a member of the Police or
Fire Departments, which must be filed in the Office of the Mayor, who shall,
thereupon, communicate said charge without delay to the legislative body. Said
charges must be written, signed by the person making such charges and must set
out with clearness and distinctness each and every charge. It shall be the duty
of the Mayor and each member of the legislative body, whenever probable cause
appears to prefer charges against any member of the Police or Fire Departments
whom he or she believes to have been guilty of any conduct justifying his or
her removal or punishment in the interest of public order. The charges thus
filed shall be written and shall set out with distinctness and clearness the
charges made, and upon the hearing of any charges, as hereinafter provided, all
of said charges shall be considered traversed, and put in issue, and the trial
shall be confined to matters related to the issue so presented. All charges
against members of the Police or Fire Departments shall be filed with the Clerk
of the legislative body and within three days after said filing, the
legislative body shall proceed to hear and examine said charges; provided two
days before said hearing the member of the Police or Fire Department, accused,
has been served with a copy of said charges, and a statement of the day, place,
and hour at which and when the hearing of said charges shall begin. The person
accused may, however, in writing, waive the service of said charges, and demand
trial within three days after said charges are filed with the Clerk of said
legislative body. The legislative body will have the power to summon and compel
the attendance of witnesses at all hearings or sittings by said body upon
subpoena issued by the Clerk of said body, and served upon said witnesses by
any officer authorized to serve subpoenas from any court of justice in the
county. If any witness fails to appear in response to a summons or refuses to
testify concerning any matter on which he or she may lawfully be interrogated,
any District Court Judge, on application of the legislative body, may compel
obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of a
subpoena issued from the District Court. The member of the Police or Fire
Department, the accused, shall have the right to have subpoenaed, in his or her
behalf, any witness he or she may desire, upon furnishing their names to the
Clerk of said body. The action and decision of said body on said charges shall
be reduced to writing and shall be entered in a book to be kept for that
purpose by the Clerk of said legislative body, and the written charges filed in
this matter shall be preserved and securely attached to the book containing the
legislative body's decisions.
   (B)   In cases where the Mayor or Chief has probable cause to believe that a
member of the Police or Fire Department has been guilty of any conduct
justifying removal or punishment, he or she may suspend said member from duty,
or from both pay and duty, pending said trial, and said member shall not be
placed on duty or allowed pay thereafter until the charges are heard by the
legislative body. The said body shall fix punishment against a member of the
Police or Fire Department found guilty of any charge under KRS 95.761 to
95.785, by reprimand or suspension for any length of time in their judgment,
not to exceed six months or by reducing the grade, if the accused be chief or
other officer, or by combining any two or more of said punishments, or by
removal or dismissal from the service of any member of the Police or Fire
Department. No member of the Police or Fire Department except as provided in
KRS 95.761 to 95.785 shall be reprimanded, removed, suspended, or dismissed
from the Department until written charges have been made, or preferred against
him or her, and a trial held as herein provided.

§ 35.76 APPEAL.
   (A)   Any member of the Police or Fire Departments who shall be found guilty
by the legislative body of any charges as hereinbefore provided, may bring an
action in the circuit court of the county in which said city may be located to
contest the action of that body.
   (B)   Upon the request of the party accused, the Clerk of said body shall
file a certified copy of the charges made and the judgment or the findings of
the said body in the Circuit Court which transcript having been filed, the
cause shall be docketed in the Circuit Court and tried as an original action by
the judge of said court. Should the Clerk of said body fail to certify and
transmit the transcript aforesaid to the Circuit Court within five days after
the request is made for same, then the party aggrieved may file an affidavit in
the said Circuit Court, setting out as fully as possible the charges made, the
time of trial by said court and the judgment of said body, together with the
statements of the facts that the demand for transcript had been made upon the
Clerk of said body more than five days before the filing of said affidavit.
Upon the filing of said affidavit in the Circuit Court, said cause shall be
docketed in said court and the Circuit Court is hereby authorized to compel the
filing of said transcript by said Clerk by entering the property mandatory
orders, and by fine and imprisonment, as in cases of contempt. Such action
shall have precedence over other business and be taken up and determined
speedily.

costs with final costs required to exceed 5% of the property's most current

removed from the files.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Fort Thomas
Code of Ethics."
(Ord. O-19-94, passed 12-5-94)
§ 39.02 FINDINGS.
   The legislative body of the City of Fort Thomas finds and declares that:
   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of this city depends upon
the public's confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers
and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the private
interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled.
   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
(Ord. O-19-94, passed 12-5-94)
§ 39.03 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring that
standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for officers
and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in their
application, and enforceable; and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
KRS 65.003, as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

§ 70.45 SALE OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLES.
   Any person engaged in the business of storing or towing motor vehicles in
either a private capacity or for the city who has substantially complied with
the requirements of § 72.21 shall have a lien on the motor vehicle for the
reasonable or agreed charges for storing or towing the vehicle as long as it
remains in his possession. If after a period of 60 days, the reasonable or
agreed charges for storing or towing a motor vehicle have not been paid, the
motor vehicle may be sold to pay the charges after the owner has been notified
by certified mail ten days prior to the time and place of the sale. Should the
proceeds of the sale of any vehicle pursuant to this section be insufficient to
satisfy accrued charges for towing, transporting, and/or storage, said sale and
collection of proceeds shall not constitute a waiver or release of
responsibility for payment of unpaid towing, transporting, and/or storage
charges by the owner or responsible casualty insurer of the vehicle. This lien
shall be subject to prior recorded liens.

§ 70.68 TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or any other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Vehicular traffic shall
yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and
to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a
turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian- control signal, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no
pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except
as follows.
         (a)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by division
(C) (1) above with the intention of making a right turn, may make the right
turn, after stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such
movement, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic
lawfully proceeding through the intersection.
         (b)   The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as required by division
(C) (1) above whose vehicle is in the left lane of a one-way highway with the
intention of making a left turn onto the left lane of another one-way highway
with the flow of traffic, may make the left turn, after stopping, unless an
official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right- of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding through the
intersection.
      (2)   The city may, by ordinance, prohibit any such right or left turn
against a steady red signal at any intersection, which prohibition shall be
effective when an official sign prohibiting the movement is erected at the
intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers
of all vehicles.

intermittent flashes, operators of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, before entering the cross- walk on the near side of the

where the operator has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting
roadway before entering it, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the
rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.

animal in his/her possession or custody, to exercise reasonable care and to
take all necessary steps and precautions to protect other people, property, and
animals from injuries or damages which might result from their animal's
behavior, regardless of whether such behavior is motivated by mischievousness,
playfulness or ferocity.
   (A)   No vicious animal shall be permitted to remain the city's territorial
limits. Every vicious animal shall be euthanized unless ordered to be
quarantined and/or contained by a court of competent jurisdiction. No vicious
animal shall be returned to its owner or harborer unless so ordered by a court
of competent jurisdiction.
   (B)   Dangerous animal to be properly confined or leashed. The owner or
harborer of a dangerous animal shall:
      (1)   When the dangerous animal is indoors secure all means of egress so
that the dog may not exit;
      (2)   Leash and muzzle. No person shall permit a dangerous animal to go
outside of its kennel, pen, or the owner's residence unless such animal is
securely restrained with a leash or lead no longer than three feet in length
and the leash or lead is physically controlled by a person 18 years of age or
older who is in physical control of the leash. Such animals may not be leashed
to inanimate objects such as trees, posts, buildings, and the like. In
addition, all such animals on a leash or lead outside of the animal's kennel,
pen, or the owner's residence must be muzzled by a muzzling device sufficient
to prevent the animal from biting persons or other animals.
      (3)   Confinement. All dangerous animals shall be securely confined
indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked pen or kennel, except when leashed
and muzzled, as provided in division (B)(2) above. Such pen, kennel, or
structure must have secure sides and a secure top attached to its sides. A
fenced-in yard by itself is insufficient to meet this standard. All structures
used to confine such animals must be locked with a key or combination lock when
such animals are within the structure. Such structure must have a secure bottom
or floor attached to the sides of the pen, or the sides of the pen must be
embedded in the ground to a depth of no less than two feet and be a minimum of
seven feet above the ground to the top of the structure. All structures erected
to house such animals must comply with all zoning and building regulations, and
all such structures must be adequately lighted, ventilated, and be of
appropriate size to allow the animal confined therein to move around, and must
be kept in a clean and sanitary condition. The house or shelter for said animal
shall be totally enclosed within the confinement structure. When being
transported, the animal must be muzzled or caged.
         (a)   Signs. All owners of dangerous animals shall display on the
kennel or pen and also in a prominent place on the premises a sign easily read
by the public from adjoining public roads or streets using a sign stating the
presence of a dangerous animal by both symbol and words.
         (b)   Inspection. All owners of dangerous animals shall allow Danerous
Animal Officers the right to inspect the area as necessary to assure that the
health and safety needs of the animals and the public are being met.
   (C)   Conditions precedent to dangerous animals being permitted to return to
and remain within the city's territorial limits. Dangerous animals shall not be
permitted to return to or remain within the city's territorial limits unless
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The animal is properly registered in the city;
      (2)   The animal is at all times kept or maintained in a safe manner and
that it is at all times confined securely so that the keeping of such animal
will not constitute a danger to human life or personal property;
      (3)   Adequate safeguards are made to prevent unauthorized access to such
animal;
      (4)   The health or well being of the animal is not in any way endangered
by the manner of keeping or confinement;
      (5)   Keeping of such animal does not constitute a public nuisance and
will not harm the surrounding neighborhood or disturb the peace and quiet of
the surrounding neighborhood;
      (6)   Keeping of such animal will not create or cause offensive odors or
constitute a danger to public health;
      (7)   The quarters in which such animal is kept or confined is adequately
lighted and ventilated and are so constructed that it may be kept in a clean
and sanitary condition, and is so kept;
   (D)   Law enforcement exclusion. It is not the intent of this section to

Penalty, see § 94.99
§ 94.36 LOCATION AND SPACING OF HYDRANTS.
   Fire hydrants installed after February 22, 1977, shall be located and spaced
in accordance with the following requirements:
   (A)   New subdivisions, business complexes, apartment complexes, and other
areas requiring the installation of fire hydrants shall have a sufficient
number of hydrants installed to provide a fire flow as determined appropriate
for that place in accordance with the current requirements of the Insurance
Services Office of Kentucky, but in no case shall the number of hydrants be
fewer than that required to provide a minimum fire flow of 1,500 gallons per
minute.
   (B)   Hydrants shall be located so as to provide protection for an
approximate area of 90,000 square feet per hydrant. Hydrants shall be installed
in exact locations indicated by the Fire Department of this city. The 4½ inch
suction outlet shall be easily accessible for Fire Department use with the
nozzle pointed in the direction of the curb or roadway.
   (C)   Hydrants shall be spaced so as to be not more than 500 feet between
hydrants in residential areas of one- and two-family dwellings, and not more
than 350 feet between hydrants in areas of high value or high density. This
spacing shall be measured along the approximate path of travel of Fire
Department pumpers.
   (D)   There shall be a minimum clear space around each hydrant of three feet
measured from the top (valve operating) nut of the hydrant extending in all
directions (360°). A foliage screen may be placed between a hydrant and an
occupancy but must maintain the three foot clear space and must not extend the
semi-circle beyond the leading edge of any outlet on the sides of the hydrant.
No foliage, other than grass, shall be permitted in the three foot clear space
from the furthermost point of the 2½ inch outlets on either side of the hydrant
and to the curb or roadway to prohibit the observation of the hydrant from the
road. The hydrant shall not be blocked from view by a vehicle from the normal
driving path of a fire apparatus regardless of the distance of the hydrant from
the curb or roadway.
   (E)   A "No Parking Zone" must be maintained on the roadway in front of the
hydrant. This zone shall be determined by a line from the operating nut of the
hydrant to the curb or roadway. At the point of intersection, an area of 4½
feet on either side of that point creates the bounds of the "No Parking Zone"
which provides a total of nine feet in front of the hydrant for pumper access.

   COMMON FIREWORKS. Fireworks suitable for use by the public and designed
primarily to produce visible effects by combustion, and which must comply with
the construction, chemical composition, and labeling regulations of the United
States Consumer Products Safety Commission. The types, sizes, and amount of
pyrotechnic contents of these devices are limited as enumerated herein. Some
small devices designed to produce audible effects are included, such as
whistling devices, ground devices containing 50 mg. or less of explosive
composition, and aerial devices containing 130 mg. or less of explosive
composition. COMMON FIREWORKS are classified as Class C explosives by the
United States Department of Transportation and include the following:
      (1)   Ground and hand-held sparkling devices.
         (a)   Dipped stick-sparkler. A stick or wire coated with pyrotechnic
composition that produces a shower of sparks upon ignition. Total pyrotechnic
composition may not exceed 100 grams per item. Those devices containing any
perchlorate or chlorate salts may not exceed five grams of pyrotechnic
composition per item. Wire sparklers which contain no magnesium and which
contain less than 100 grams of composition per item are not included in this
category, in accordance with the U.S. Department of Transportation regulations.
         (b)   Cylindrical fountain. A cylindrical tube not more than three-
fourths inch (19 mm) inside diameter, containing up to 75 grams of pyrotechnic
composition. Upon ignition, a shower of colored sparks, and sometimes a
whistling effect, is produced. This device may be provided with a spike for
insertion into the ground (spike fountain), a wood or plastic base for placing
on the ground (base fountain), or a wood or cardboard handle, if intended to be
hand-held (handle fountain).
         (c)   Cone fountain. A cardboard or heavy paper cone containing up to
50 grams of pyrotechnic composition. The effect is the same as that of a
cylindrical fountain.

single housekeeping unit with facilities which are used or designed to be used
for living, sleeping, cooking, or eating.
   DWELLING. Any building which contains one or more dwelling units or any
rooming unit, rooms, or area designated or used for sleeping purposes, either
as a primary use or use on casual occasions. DWELLING shall include a rooming
house, motels, tourist homes, school dormitories, apartment buildings, and
condominiums but not to the exclusion of other dwelling units.
   OWNER. Any person or legal entity who alone, jointly, or severally with
others:
      (1)   Shall have all or part of the legal title to any dwelling or
dwelling unit, with or without accompanying actual possession thereof, or shall
have all or part of the beneficial ownership of any dwelling or dwelling unit
and a right to present use and enjoyment thereof, including a mortgage in
possession.

§ 94.61 SMOKE DETECTORS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Subject to such exceptions and conditions for compliance as stated
herein, six months after the effective date of this subchapter, smoke detectors
shall be required in all dwellings privately owned or rented for occupancy. It
shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new or existing occupied
dwelling unit to install smoke detectors in each dwelling unit as hereinafter
provided. The smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing visible or invisible
particles of combustion and providing a suitable audible (or visual for the
deaf or hearing-impaired) alarm.
   (B)   This subchapter shall apply to any and all dwelling or dwelling units,
new or existing, which do not fall under the jurisdiction of the currently
adopted Kentucky Building Code or the currently adopted Standards of Safety.
(Ord. O-23-95, passed 11-6-95)
Penalty, see § 94.99
§ 94.62 TYPE AND PLACEMENT.
   (A)   In order to comply with this subchapter, only ionization or
photoelectric type detectors approved by a nationally-recognized testing
laboratory shall be installed. As an alternative to self-contained smoke
detectors, under certain limited conditions (that is, battery-powered smoke
detectors), an approved fire detection system or a combination thereof may be
installed. The Bureau of Fire Protection of the Fire Department may
subjectively, and on a case-by-case basis, approve each and every alternative
system in written form.
   (B)   Smoke detectors in new residential dwelling shall be wired directly
(hard wired) to the building's power supply. In existing buildings, it is
preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power supply; however,
the detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery or operated by an
electrical plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device,
provided that the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the main
power supply.
   (C)   Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with applicable N.F.P.A.
Standards (see
§ 94.64). Detectors may be ceiling or wall mounted, provided that if wall
mounted they shall be within twelve inches, but not closer than six inches, of
the ceiling.
   (D)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area. A sleeping area is defined as the area or areas of the dwelling
unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping rooms) are located. Where bedrooms or
rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other used areas (such as
kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section. In a
dwelling unit which contains a well-defined sleeping room separated from the
other activity areas of the same unit, the detector shall be located in the
corridor within the unit or interior area giving direct access to the rooms
used for sleeping purposes. Where sleeping areas are separated or where a
single smoke detector will not adequately service all sleeping areas, there
shall be a smoke detector installed adjacent to each sleeping area.
   (E)   In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally located on the
ceiling.
   (F)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any rooming
unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors in each
dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally located
common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately service all sleeping
areas.
   (G)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed in or near each
stairway leading up to an occupied area in such a manner as to assure that
rising smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector and the detector
intercepts rising smoke before it reaches the occupied areas.
(Ord. O-23-95, passed 11-6-95)
Penalty, see § 94.99
§ 94.63 INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The owner of the dwelling shall be responsible for supplying and
installing in an operable condition the required detectors and for providing
maintenance and testing in an owner-occupied residence; or for providing the
manufacturer's maintenance and testing instructions to a tenant in the case of
rental property.
   (B)   The owner of the dwelling shall be responsible for maintenance and
testing of detectors, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, which are
located in common areas of detectors in rooming units where the tenant usually
has short periods of occupancy (hotels, motels, rooming or tourist homes).
   (C)   The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and testing the
detector, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions which are within
his/her exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant shall be
responsible for notifying, in writing, the owner when the detector becomes
inoperable, whereafter the owner has ten days in which to repair or replace in
operable condition the detector. In the battery-operated type of detector,
battery replacement shall be the responsibility of the tenant.
   (D)   At every change of tenancy, it shall be the duty of the owner to test
and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition prior to re-renting the unit.
   (E)   At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by or
incidental to a sale, lease or sub-lease of the unit, it shall be the duty of
the grantor thereof (that is, the seller lessor or sub-lessor, as the case may
be) to provide, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke detectors
as required by this section (or other applicable laws) are installed and in
proper working condition. Failure to comply with this division shall be
punishable as set forth herein; provided, however, that this division shall not
be construed to violate or render void any contract, lease, or sub-lease
subject to hereto.
   (F)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly connected
(permanently wired) to the electrical system of a structure without the proper
electrical certification.

ash and sand for backfilling conduits under public roadways.
         (b)   Materials shall be:
            1.   Cement 801.01;
            2.   Fly ash shall meet ASTM C-618;
            3.   Fine aggregate shall be natural sand or sand manufactured from
stone, gravel, or aircooled slag. The gradation of the sand shall meet the
requirements of 804. The sand shall be fine enough to stay in suspension in the
mixture to the extent required for proper flow. The Director of General
Services reserves the right to reject the sand if a flowable mixture cannot be
produced.
            4.   Water used for mortar backfill shall be free from oil, acid,
strong alkalies or vegetable matter.
         (c)   Mortar mix proportioning. The initial trial mixture shall
consist of the following quantities of materials per cubic yard:
 
               Class LSM - O
Cement         50 lbs.
Fly ash        250 lbs.
Sand           2910 lbs.
               500 lbs. adjustments of the proportions may be made by the
Water (Target) Director of General Services providing the total absolute volume
               of the materials is maintained.
         (d)   Mix adjustment. The supplier shall make one or more one-cubic
yard trial batches at different water contents to insure a flowable mortar.
Mixture is too dry when cracks develop in the mortar as it flows into place.
         (e)   To expedite settlement of the mortar, it will be necessary for
bleed water to appear on the surface immediately after the mortar is struck
off. A delay in bleeding indicates there are too many fines in the mixture, so
the fly ash quantity shall be reduced in increments of 50 pounds until the
mixture is bleeding freely. Approximately 60 pounds of sand shall be added to
replace each 50 pound increments of fly ash to maintain the original yield.
         (f)   Mixing mortar. The mortar shall be delivered to the site of the
work and discharge shall be completed within two and one-half hours.
         (g)   Placing mortar. Flowable mortar shall be discharged from the
mixer by any reasonable means into the space to be filled. The fill material
shall be brought up uniformly to the fill line shown on the plans or as
directed by the Director of General Services. Placing of material over low-
strength mortar backfill may commence as soon as the surface water is gone or
as directed.
         (h)   Before placing the flowable mortar as backfill for a storm sewer
conduit, the permittee shall secure the conduit to prevent it from floating
during placement of the flowable mortar. The permittee's proposed method of
backfill placement and proposed method of holding the conduit at the plan grade
and flowline elevations should be discussed prior to construction.
      (2)   Excavation material for compacted backfill. Any material from
excavation of trenches which is desired to be used for backfill above pipes,
which is to be compacted, shall be clean and shall be of such composition that
said material can be compacted to 95% relative density with near optimum water
content.
      (3)   Seeding and protection. All grass areas disturbed by construction
shall be restored by seeding and mulching as per KTC Item 212.03.
      (4)   Full-depth pavement sawing. All existing pavement to be removed
shall be sawed full depth at the limits of removal, using a diamond saw blade
to provide a uniform edge and prevent damage to the pavement that is to remain
in place. All pavement sawing should be performed at right angles whenever
possible.
      (5)   Item 403 - sealing edges. All edges of the asphalt concrete surface
course constructed under this contract shall be sealed with asphalt cement
meeting the same specifications as used in Item 403. Sealing edges shall be
done neatly and without more than one-half inch of the sealant being visible on
the surface. Any extra sealant applied to visible surfaces shall be carefully
and thoroughly removed by the permittee.
      (6)   Responsibility for dust, dirt, and appearance. The permittee shall
do everything possible to minimize dust and dirt, and to keep the appearance of
the area surrounding the street opening in good order. The permittee shall use
calcium chloride or equal to keep dust to a minimum. After the close of each
working day, the permittee shall see that the surrounding area around the
opening is swept up, and as clean as possible. At no time will it be
permissible to leave piles of excavated dirt in the street or sidewalk. If
necessary, the area will be washed with water. The permittee shall do whatever
the Director of General Services deems necessary to clean up the area.
      (7)   The typical detail sections, attached to Ordinance No. O-4-04,
passed March 1, 2004, shall be utilized for all restoration work based upon the
existing conditions and improvements.

§ 98.14 POWERS AND DUTIES OF TREE COMMISSION.
   The powers and duties of the Tree Commission shall include:
   (A)   Provide public promotion and leadership in facilitating public
awareness of tree conservation, tree protection, and tree planting issues.
   (B)   Landmark trees.
      (1)   Designate and maintain records of “Landmark Trees” on city and
private property. A tree may qualify as a landmark tree if it meets one or more
of the following criteria:
         (a)   The tree species is rare.
         (b)   The tree is more than 100 years of age.
         (c)   The tree has been connected with a significant historical event.
         (d)   The tree is of an outstanding trunk diameter or drip line
diameter for a tree of its species.
         (e)   The quality of the tree foliage is outstanding for a tree of its
species.
         (f)   The location, shade value, fragrance, erosion control, aesthetic
features or scenic enhancement of such tree is of special importance to the
city.
      (2)   All trees designated as landmark trees by the Tree Commission shall
be shown on an Official City Map with appropriate code marks signifying each
trees designation, number, species, age, and periodic monitoring.
      (3)   If the owner or owners of the property on which a landmark tree is
located consent thereto, the Tree Commission may identify such tree as a
landmark tree by the placement of a suitable marker thereon. The cost of the
marker shall be underwritten by the property owner.
      (4)   Prior to the removal of any designated landmark tree, the Tree
Commission may suggest alternate building areas in an effort to preserve said
landmark tree. If and when any landmark tree is removed, the Tree Commission
shall arrange for the necessary changes to be made to the official landmark
tree inventory records and the City Map.
   (C)   The Tree Commission shall prepare and submit a list of trees to the
city staff suitable for planting in public right-of-way areas that are
conducive to growth in the Greater Cincinnati region. All city trees located on
property owned by the city or on public right-of-ways shall be maintained by
the city. The Tree Commission may be consulted with regard to the selection,
location and planting of trees that are to be placed on city property or right-
of-way. When consulted, the Tree Commission shall check to ensure no
underground utilities exist in the area where a tree is to be planted.
   (D)   If the Tree Commission receives actual notification that a city tree
is dead, dying, diseased or infested such that it represents a threat to public
safety or a danger to other trees within the city, the Commission shall bring
the same to the attention of the city staff. Further, the staff shall be
notified by the Tree Commission when a tree is considered a hazard because it
obstructs the view of motor vehicle operations or otherwise interferes with
traffic or pedestrian safety. In the event the complete removal of a tree is
not required, it may be pruned pursuant to the requirements contained herein.
This chapter is intended solely to improve city aesthetics, and nothing herein,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other person or entity any legal or
equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any nature.
   (E)   Whenever development is to occur on city property when city trees are
affected, the Tree Commission shall be notified by the city to review the
development plans and make recommendations to the city that will minimize the
impact on said trees. Tree Commission recommendations should encourage tree
conservation whenever practical, or provide advice as to when tree removal is
more feasible. In determining whether tree removal may be necessary, the Tree
Commission should consider:
      (1)   Whether the presence of such tree would cause hardship or endanger
the public or an adjoining property owner.
      (2)   Whether such tree is located in an area to be occupied by
buildings, driveways, recreation areas or other construction or within the drip
line of a tree.
      (3)   Whether such tree is located in an area to have a cut or fill of
land that may be injurious or dangerous to such tree.
   (F)   Any public utility serving the city with overhead services shall have
the right to remove city trees, without the prior approval of the city, only
when an emergency exists and when obtaining the prior approval of the city and/
or Tree Commission is not practical. All public utilities with overhead
services shall coordinate all non-emergency tree trimming activities with the
city staff and/or Tree Commission that are reasonably required for the purpose
of providing the appropriate utility service or to avoid danger to the public
or overhead utility personnel or equipment pursuant to the requirements
contained in the franchise agreements as authorized by the Board of Council of
the city. Any other person(s) or firm, except the public utility with overhead
lines having line clearing operations (tree trimming) done by them or, for them
by any person(s) or firm shall first obtain written approval from the city.

PLANNING COMMISSION FUNCTION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
§ 98.20 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBDIVISION PLANS AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   All subdivision plans and development plans submitted for consideration to
the Fort Thomas Planning Commission shall address the following sections in
this subchapter. The Planning Commission shall have sole enforcement authority
of said chapter as it relates to subdivision plans and development plans.
(Ord. O-4-90, passed 5-7-90; Am. Ord. O-18-2023, passed 12-18-23)
§ 98.21 REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   (A)   The following requirements shall apply for all development plans
submitted for a development in a NSC zone, GC zone, HC zone, PO zone, and IP
zone.
      (1)   (a)   A Tree Inventory Plan shall be submitted in conjunction with
all development plans for a development contained in this section. The Tree
Inventory Plan shall be submitted pursuant to the requirements contained in
Section 9.24.C.4. of the Fort Thomas Zoning Ordinance.
         (b)   The Tree Inventory Plan shall also identify any landmark tree(s)
and delineate the buildable area of a proposed development. The Planning
Commission may permit the removal of a tree outside the buildable area, with
the advice of the Tree Commission pursuant to the requirements contained
elsewhere in §
98.22 provided the removal of the tree is reasonably required to develop the
parcel in compliance with this subchapter.
      (2)   (a)   All trees to be saved outside of the buildable area of a
development shall be conspicuously designated with suitable protective tree
barriers as designated herein or as otherwise approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Approved tree protective barriers shall be installed along the
outermost dripline around the tree protection zone. The use of tree protection
zones is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen)
trees that may be scattered throughout a development site.
         (b)   The layout of development improvements, utilities, access
drives, grading, etc., of a site shall accommodate the required tree protective
zones. The public improvements shall be placed along the corridors between tree
protective zones unless the placement of same causes undue hardship on the
developer as determined by the Planning Commission. If the Planning Commission
determines that public improvements and/or utilities may be placed within a
tree protective zone, the installation of same shall occur by way of tunneling
rather than trenching.
         (c)   Construction site activities including, but not limited to,
material storage, parking, or concrete washout, shall not encroach into any
tree protection zone without the prior approval of the Zoning Administrator.
Any tree irreparably damaged or killed within a tree protection zone as a
result of construction activity, shall be removed and replaced by the owner
and/or developer at a rate of two trees for every tree irreparably damaged or
killed.
         (d)   Protective tree barriers shall be installed to a minimum height
of four feet above ground level around the outermost dripline of the tree
protection zone. Tree protection zones shall be delineated with typical
temporary construction fencing or continuous rope or flagging. In either case,
the tree protection barrier shall be accompanied by "Tree Save Area" signage to
be placed around the tree save zone not more than every 20 feet.
      (3)   (a)   A Tree Planting Plan shall also be submitted in conjunction
with the development plan submission. One tree shall be planted on the
development site for every five required parking spaces. Any tree planted
relative to the requirements contained herein shall not be less than three
inches in diameter when planted.
         (b)   The Tree Planting Plan shall indicate the total number and
species of trees to be planted within a proposed development along with the
intended location of same. Trees required to be planted by this chapter should
be planted predominately in the developed areas, driveway aisles, and/or
parking areas of the project. In no case shall more than 50% of the trees
required to be planted be utilized to satisfy the screening requirements of a
development. The exact location of the trees to be planted and species shall be
approved by the Planning Commission, after review of all Tree Commission
recommendations, as part of the Stage I review process. Whenever the owner/
developer can demonstrate to the Planning Commission that the site spatial
constraints result in an absolute inability to plant the required number of
trees, as many trees as possible shall be planted on the site. The difference
of those trees required to be planted, and those trees planted, shall be
donated to the city for use elsewhere in the city on public property. A
reduction credit of one tree or more shall be granted to a owner/developer when
either of the following conditions exist:
            1.   For every tree saved within the buildable area of a
development eight inches or more in diameter; or
            2.   For every two trees saved within the buildable area of a
development four to eight inches in diameter.

elsewhere in §
98.22, provided the removal of the tree is reasonably required to develop the
parcel in compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   (a)   All trees to be saved outside of the buildable area of a
development shall be conspicuously designated with suitable protective tree
barriers as designated herein or as otherwise approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Approved tree protective barriers shall be installed along the
outermost dripline around the tree protection zone. The use of tree protection
zones is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen)
trees that may be scattered throughout a development site.
         (b)   The layout of development improvements, utilities, access
drives, grading, etc., of a site shall accommodate the required tree protection

rather than trenching.
         (c)   Construction site activities including, but not limited to,
material storage, parking, or concrete washout shall not encroach into any tree

be placed around the tree save zone not more than every 20 feet.
      (3)   (a)   A Tree Planting Plan shall also be submitted in conjunction
with the development submission. One tree shall be planted on the development
site for every one unit approved. Any tree planted relative to the requirements
contained herein shall not be less than three inches in diameter when planted.
         (b)   The Tree Planting Plan shall indicate the total number and
species of trees to be planted within a proposed development along with the
intended location of same. Trees required to be planted by this chapter should
be planted predominately in the developed areas, driveway aisles, and/or
parking areas of the project. In no case shall more than 50% of the trees
required to be planted be utilized to satisfy the screening requirements of a
development. The exact location of the trees to be planted and species shall be
approved by the Planning Commission, after review of all Tree Commission
recommendations, as part of the Stage I review process. Whenever the owner/
developer can demonstrate to the Planning Commission that the site spatial
constraints result in an absolute inability to plant the required number of

of those trees required to be planted and those trees planted shall be donated
to the city for use elsewhere in the city on public property. A reduction
credit of one tree or more shall be granted to an owner/developer when either
of the following exist:
            1.   For every tree saved within the buildable area of a
development eight inches or more in diameter; or

all subdivision plans for a subdivision contained in this section. The Tree
Inventory Plan shall be submitted pursuant to the requirements contained in
Section 9.24.C.4. of the Fort Thomas Zoning Ordinance.
         (b)   The Tree Inventory Plan shall also identify any landmark tree(s)
and delineate the buildable area for each proposed subdivision lot. The
Planning Commission may permit the removal of any tree(s) outside the buildable
area of a subdivision lot with the advice of the Tree Commission pursuant to
the requirements contained elsewhere in §
98.22, provided the removal of the tree(s) is reasonably required to develop
the subdivision in compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   (a)   All trees to be saved outside of the buildable area of a
subdivision lot shall be conspicuously designated with suitable protective tree
barriers as designated herein or as otherwise approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Approved tree protective barriers shall be installed along the
outermost dripline around the tree protection zone. The use of tree protection
zones is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen)
trees that may be scattered throughout an individual lot.
         (b)   The layout of the subdivision improvements, utilities,
driveways, etc., should accommodate the required tree protective zones.
Whenever practical, public improvements, utilities, or driveways should be
placed along the corridors between tree protective zones. When public
improvements or utilities are placed within a tree protection zone,
installation of same shall occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching.
         (c)   Construction site activities including, but not limited to,
material storage, parking or concrete washout, shall not encroach into any tree
protection zone without the prior approval of the Zoning Administrator. Any
tree irreparably damaged or killed within a tree protection zone as a result of

be placed around the tree save zone not more than every 20 feet.
      (3)   (a)   A Tree Planting Plan shall also be submitted in conjunction
with the subdivision plan submission. One tree shall be planted on each lot for
every 5,000 square feet of lot area or fraction thereof. The tree(s) required
to be planted on each lot may be planted on the lot or on the public right-of-
way in front of each lot. Any tree planted relative to the requirements
contained herein shall not be less than three inches in diameter when planted.
         (b)   The Tree Planting Plan shall indicate the total number and
species of trees to be planted on each lot along with the intended location of
same. The exact location of the trees and species to be planted shall be
approved by the Planning Commission, after review of all Tree Commission
recommendations, as part of the Stage I review process. Whenever the owner/
developer can demonstrate to the Planning Commission that the spatial
constraints of a lot result in an absolute inability to plant the required
number of trees, as many trees as possible shall be planted on the lot. The
difference of those trees required to be planted and those trees planted shall
be donated to the city for use elsewhere in the city on public property. A
reduction credit of one tree or more shall be granted to a owner/developer when

division (C) of this section.
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (A) through (E) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the city.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)    The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)    The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenue, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage that the compensation
for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to the total
wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to verify the
accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this division, the taxpayer
shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
"passed through" these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.

§ 113.05 EMPLOYERS TO WITHHOLD.
   (A)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee shall
deduct and withhold upon the payment of the compensation an occupational
license tax calculated under
§113.03 imposed against the compensation by the city. Amounts withheld shall be
paid to the city in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter ending
thereafter, on or before the end of the month following the close of each
quarter, make a return and report to the city, and pay to the city, the tax
required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or
required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the city.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any sums
required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to be
withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational
license tax withheld where compensation is paid or payable to employees. Either
copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax statements, or
a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the city, shall be submitted.
   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or before
January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee
for payment to the city during the preceding calendar year.
   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this section shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
division unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for,
or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes imposed
by this chapter become or became due.
   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H) of this section, every employee
receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
113.03 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the
employer does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee,
such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the city each
quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer or as otherwise
required by the city. If an employer fails to or is not required to withhold,
report, or pay the license tax it shall become the duty of the employee to file
with the city. The only employer that is not required to withhold, report, and
pay the occupational license tax is the Federal Government including the United
States Postal Service. The payment required to be made by an employee can be
made quarterly, for the periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and
December 31 of each year, or at any time the employee wishes to make an
estimated payment for the year in which wages are earned. All license fees must
be received by February 28 for the preceding calendar year, together with a
copy of the employee's W-2 form. Employers not required to withhold, report, or
pay the license tax must annually, during the month of January of each year,
make a return to the city, in which is set forth the name and social security
number of each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar year,
giving the amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation earned
during such preceding year by each such employee. This list shall include all
current full time employees, part time employees, temporary employees, and
terminated employees whether it be voluntary or involuntary.

made by April 15 of each year, except returns made on the basis of a fiscal
year, which shall be made by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
the close of the fiscal year. Blank forms for returns shall be supplied by the
city.
   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income tax
return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing its

entity in order to audit the return, the city may compel the business entity to

thereof that have not been previously filed. The city may also require copies
of reports of adjustments made by the federal government.
   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath

may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems sufficient to
determine the tax liability of the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the taxable income
of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business
entity or of any other person having knowledge on the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity, as
it appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the city at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return, determined without
regard to any extension of time for filing the return.
   (F)   Every business entity making payments of $600 or more to persons other
than employees for services performed within the city is responsible for
maintaining the records of those payments and for completing IRS Form 1099 on
or before February 28 of the year following the close of the calendar year in
which such compensation was paid and to remit copies of the IRS Form 1099 or

return, if the business entity, on or before the date prescribed for payment of
the occupational license tax, requests in writing the extension and pays the
amount properly estimated as its tax. Extension request forms shall be supplied
by the city.
   (B)   If the time for filing a return is extended, the business shall pay,
as part of the tax, an amount equal to 12% per annum simple interest on the tax
shown due on the return, but not previously paid, from the time the tax was due
until the return is actually filed and the tax paid to the city. A fraction of
a month is counted as an entire month.

received by the city from the employer within two years from the date the
overpayment was made no refund or credit shall be allowed. Where there has been
an overpayment of the maximum tax due under §
113.05, a refund or credit shall be made to the employee to the extend of
overpayment only if a written application for refund is received by the city
from the employer of the employee within two years from the date the
overpayment was made. All written applications for refunds shall be submitted

outside the city, based on time spent outside the city, whose employer has
withheld and remitted to this city, the occupational license tax on the
compensation attributable to activities performed outside the city, may file
for a refund within two years of the date prescribed by law for the filing of a
return. The employee shall provide a schedule and computation sufficient to
verify the refund claim and the city may confirm with the employer the
percentage of time spent outside the city and the amount of compensation
attributable to activities performed outside the city prior to approval of the
refund.
   (C)   Where there has been an overpayment of tax under
§ 113.03, a refund or credit shall be made to any person or business entity to
the extent of overpayment only if a written application for refund or credit is

§ 113.09 FEDERAL AUDIT PROVISIONS.
   (A)   As soon as practicable after each return is received, the city may
examine and audit the return. If the amount of tax computed by the city is
greater than the amount returned by the business entity, the additional tax
shall be assessed and a notice of assessment mailed to the business entity by
the city within five years from the date the return was filed, except as
otherwise provided in this division.
      (1)   In the case of a failure to file a return or of a fraudulent return
the additional tax may be assessed at any time.
      (2)   In the case of a return where a business entity understates net

understatement or omission, or both, is in excess of 25% of the amount of net
profit stated in the return, the additional tax may be assessed at any time
within six years after the return was filed.
      (3)   In the case of an assessment of additional tax relating directly to
adjustments resulting from a final determination of a federal audit, the
additional tax may be assessed before the expiration of the times provided in
this division, or six months from the date the city receives the final
determination of the federal audit from the business entity, whichever is
later.
      (4)   The times provided in this division may be extended by agreement
between the business entity and the city. For the purposes of this division, a
return filed before the last day prescribed by law for filing the return shall

returns, or reports required to be filed with the tax district or other proper

of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or his or her duly authorized agent all such
information and rights to inspect any of the books and records of the city if

Kentucky Department of Revenue and maintains the privileged character of the
information so furnished. Provided, further, that the city may publish
statistics based on such information in such a manner as not to reveal data
respecting net profits or compensation of any person or business entity.
   (C)   In addition, the city is empowered to execute similar reciprocity
