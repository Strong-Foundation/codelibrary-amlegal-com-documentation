PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 34.05 INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.
   (A)   Any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records of this city
shall make a request for inspection at the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer/
Tax Collector during regular office hours, except during legal holidays. The
official custodian, or the custodian acting under the authority of the official
custodian, may require a request to inspect public records to be in writing,
signed by the applicant and with the applicant’s name printed legibly on the
application. A written request to inspect public records may be presented by
hand delivery, mail or via facsimile, if one is available.
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in compliance
with this chapter and the open records law, and the requested public records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection. A person may inspect public records at the designated office of the
city during the regular office hours, or in appropriate cases, by receiving
copies of the records through the mail.
   (C)   If the public records are to be inspected at the offices of the city,
suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk-
Treasurer/Tax Collector or in another office of the city as determined by the
official custodian or custodian for the inspection. No person shall remove
original copies of public records from the offices of the city without the
written permission of the official custodian of the record. When public records
are inspected at the city offices, the person inspecting the records shall have
the right to make abstracts and memoranda of the public records and to obtain
copies of all written public records. When copies are requested, the custodian
may require advance payment of the prescribed fee.
   (D)   Upon proper request, the city shall mail copies of the public records
to a person whose residence or principal place of business is located outside
of the county after the person precisely describes the public records which are
readily available and after the person pays in advance the prescribed fee.
§ 34.06 REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.
   If the City Clerk-Treasurer/Tax Collector does not have custody or control
of the public record or records requested, the City Clerk- Treasurer/Tax

(KRS 61.872(4))
§ 34.07 PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.

holidays) from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the
cause is given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on
which the public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 34.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies thereof. However, refusal under this section must be sustained by
clear and convincing evidence.
(KRS 61.872(6))
§ 34.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
   The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this
chapter, shall determine within five days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and

request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the
five-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of
how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under his authority and shall constitute final
agency action.

and advance payment of the prescribed fee, including postage where appropriate.
If the applicant desires copies of public records other than written records,
the custodian of the records shall duplicate the records or permit the
applicant to duplicate the records; however, the custodian shall ensure that
such duplication will not damage or alter the original records.
   (B)   (1)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall
be available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency

electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor’s requirements, the public record may be provided in
this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public
agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms
described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.

nonexempt public records requested for use for noncommercial purposes which
shall not exceed the actual cost of reproduction, including the costs of the
media and any mechanical processing cost incurred by the public agency, but not
including the cost of staff required. If a public agency is asked to produce a
record in a nonstandardized format, or to tailor the format to meet the request
of an individual or a group, the public agency may at its discretion provide
the requested format and recover staff costs as well as any actual costs
incurred.
   (B)   (1)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee.
      (2)   The public agency from which copies of nonexempt public records are
requested for a commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the
requestor stating the commercial purpose for which they shall be used, and may
require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract
shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a
specified fee.
      (3)   The fee provided for in division (B)(1) of this section may be
based on one or both of the following:
         (a)   Cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing, and

the public record for a different commercial purpose; or

of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper, periodical, radio

10.99

CROSS CONNECTION PREVENTION
§ 50.55 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish a program to assure
that the public water supply is protected from any auxiliary water supply which
may cause contamination due to backflow or cross connections. Contamination of
the public water supply presents an imminent health hazard to the residential
and non-residential users of the public water system; there is the threat of
significant economic loss due to disrupted water service to such residential
and nonresidential water users and potential liability to the city.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this subchapter to meet the requirements
of 401 KAR 8:020 as enacted by the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental
Protection Cabinet.
(Ord. 2014-72.01b, passed 4-8-14)
§ 50.56 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   “AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY.” Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the city’s public water supply. These auxiliary waters may include
water from any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream or body of
water or any water or other substance of unknown or questionable quality that
may present a health or system hazard to the potable public water supply.
   “BACKFLOW.” The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either back
pressure or back siphon age.
   “BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY.” An assembly or means designed to prevent
backflow. A listing of acceptable backflow prevention assemblies and degree of
hazard is available in the Kentucky State Plumbing Law, Regulations and Code.
   “CONTAMINATION.” An impairment of the quality of the potable water supply by
any waste product, fluid, substance, compound or other material to a degree
that creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through
poisoning or through the spread of disease.
   “CROSS CONNECTION.” Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems one of which contains
potable water and the other nonpotable water or substance of questionable
quality, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur into the
potable water system.
   “SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED OR MODIFIED.” Improvements requiring issuance of a
plumbing permit prior to construction or connection.
   “THERMAL EXPANSION TANK.” A device installed on the cold water supply line
near a water heater to compensate for the expansion of water within a water
system when such water is heated.
(Ord. 2014-72.01b, passed 4-8-14)
§ 50.57 REQUIREMENTS.
   In order to provide protection to the public water system against backflow
the following requirements shall be met.
   (A)   Residential. Buildings used for habitation or occupancy shall be
considered as residential buildings. No new or substantially improved or
modified water service connection to any premises shall be installed or allowed
to be installed by the city unless a backflow prevention assembly protects such
service connection. Residential service connections shall be considered as low
hazard applications and all such connections shall have at a minimum a dual
check valve backflow preventer installed between the water meter and the
residence. The city may require additional or alternate backflow prevention
assemblies if the degree of hazard constitutes a higher level of protection for
the public water system.
   (B)   Non-residential. No new or substantially improved or modified water
service connection to any non-residential facility shall be installed or
allowed to be installed by the city unless such water service connection is
protected by a backflow prevention assembly. The type of protective device
required shall be determined at the time of installation of the service
connection and shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard at the point of
such service connection. At a minimum the service connection shall be installed
with a dual check valve backflow preventer. In the event activities to occur
within a non-residential facility change and creates a higher degree of hazard,
then the backflow prevention assembly shall be replaced with an assembly that
provides acceptable protection.
   (C)   Inspections. The customer’s water system shall be open for inspection
at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to determine
whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including
violation of this subchapter, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the
city may deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a
physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the
condition in conformance with the state and local statutes relating to
plumbing, water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuantly thereto. Water
service to any premises shall be discontinued if it is found that a backflow
prevention assembly required by this subchapter has been removed, bypassed, or
if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be
restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
   (D)   Existing service connections.
      (1)   All existing water service connections which do not have backflow
prevention assemblies or existing water service connections which have less
than the minimum required backflow prevention assemblies, shall, except for the
inspection requirements, be excluded from the requirements of this subchapter
so long as the city is assured that the public water system is satisfactorily
protected. However, if the city determines that a hazard to health exists, or
the administrative regulations of the Commonwealth of Kentucky so require, then
a backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this subchapter may
be installed on such existing service connection. Backflow prevention
assemblies shall not be installed on existing service connections until after
the property owner of such residential or commercial property has been informed
of the actual and potential hazards that may be created as a result of such
backflow assembly installation.
      (2)   Notices provided to such property owners shall include the
following language as adopted in 815 KAR 20:120 Section 2, Item (6): When cross
connection control devices are properly installed, they create a closed water
system. A properly sized thermal expansion tank shall be installed in the cold
water supply located as near the water heater as possible.
(Ord. 2014-72.01b, passed 4-8-14)
§ 50.98 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter, except
§

the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory
correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in the
notice, permanently cease all violations.
   (B)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the city for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned the city
by reason of the violation.
(Ord. 72.01, passed 3-9-70)
§ 50.99 PENALTY.

a violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense.

      (2)   That if any bill is not paid by or before the 15th of the month,
service will be disconnected for nonpayment; and

shall have a right to request a hearing before the 10th of the month, at which
time he or she may be represented in person and by counsel of any other person
of his or her choosing and may present orally or in writing his or her
complaint and contentions to the city official in charge of utility billing.
This official shall be authorized to order that the customer’s service not be
discontinued and shall have the authority to make a final determination of the
customer’s complaint.
   (C)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained; only
questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence of
payment of the bill rendered, or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will discontinued at the time specified.
   (D)   In the event any bill is not paid by or before the 15th of the month,
the following charges will apply:
      (1)   If the city sends its representative to the property to disconnect
service, but the customer submits payment prior to the representative
physically turns off the utility, then the customer must pay a fee of $50
dollars; and
      (2)   If the utility service is physically disconnected by the city’s
representative, the city may apply any deposit made to the unpaid bill and may
require payment of the balance in full, plus a new deposit or deposits, and a
re-connect service fee of up to $50 before restoring any service. Upon two
disconnections within a 12 month period, an additional deposit of $100 dollars
is due to continue service.
   (E)   The city shall have a lien against the real estate served or partially
served by city utilities for the amount of any unpaid utility bills, after set-
off for any deposits held by the city.
   (F)   The lien shall apply without respect to whether the service was billed
to the real estate owner or to an occupant of the same.
   (G)   In order to perfect the lien, the city shall mail or deliver notice of
intent to assert a lien for utility bills to the owner of the real property
within 30 days after the bill or bills become delinquent.
   (H)   Enforcement of the perfected lien shall be in the same manner as the
enforcement of its lien of real property taxes.
   (I)   A request for an extension to pay a utility bill must be signed and
notarized by the owner of the property to which the lien will attach, and all
utility service fees must be paid in not less than two months following the due
date, as follows:
      (1)   Not less than one-half of the due bill shall be paid by the due
date;
      (2)   The entire bill due the next month plus one-half of the arrears,
including penalty, shall be paid by the due date; and

      (1)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement wall
seepage or floor seepage, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other
sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain
which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to the POTW, Any such
connections which already exist on the effective date of this chapter shall be
completely and permanently disconnected within 60 days of the effective date of
this chapter. The owners of any building sewers having such connections, leaks
or defects shall bear all costs incidental to removal of such sources. Pipes,
sumps and pumps for such sources of ground and surface water shall be separate
from the POTW. Removal of such sources of water without presence of separate
facilities shall be evidence of drainage to POTW.
      (2)   Floor, basement or crawl space drains which are lower than ground
surfaces surrounding the building shall not be connected to the building
sanitary sewer. No sanitary inlet which is lower than six inches above the top
of the lowest of the two adjacent public sanitary sewer manholes shall be
connected by direct drainage to the building sanitary sewer.
   (C)   Design and installation.
      (1)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway, the sewer from
the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any
obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such
single connection aforementioned.
      (2)   Old building sewers maybe used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent, to
meet all requirements of this chapter. Permit and inspection fees and tap-on
fees for new buildings using existing building sewers shall be the same as for
new building sewers. If additional sewer consumers or additional facilities are
added to the old building sewers, additional sewer tap fees shall be charged
accordingly even though no new sewer tap is actually made into the city’s POTW.
      (3)   Extension of customer service lines from any point on the
customer’s side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than
that of the customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be
permitted.
      (4)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM A-74, latest
revision, PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) sewer pipe, ASTM D-3034, latest revision, or
ductile iron pipe, A WWA Specification C-151 cement lined, and shall meet
requirements of State plumbing code. Joints shall be as set out hereinafter.
Any part of the building sewer that is located within five feet of a water
service pipe shall be constructed with cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron
pipe, unless the building sewer is at least one foot deeper in the ground than
the water service line. In the latter case, vitrified clay pipe may be used
cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe may be required by the city where the
building sewer is exposed to damage or stoppage by tree roots, cast iron soil
pipe or ductile iron pipe shall be used in filled or unstable ground, in areas
where the cover over the building sewer is less than three feet, or in areas
where the sewer is subject to vehicular or other external loads.
      (5)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the local and state building and plumbing codes and other applicable rules and
regulations of the City. In general, the building sewer shall not be less than
four inches in diameter. The slope of the building sewer shall in no event be
less than one-eighth inch per foot.
      (6)   In the absence of local code provisions or in amplification
thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications
of the ASTM and WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply.
      (7)   No building sewer shall be laid parallel to within three feet of
any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient
to afford 24 inches of cover over pipe except where exposed to vehicular
traffic. Portions of the building sewer subject to vehicular traffic shall have
a minimum cover of 36 inches or be encased in a six inch envelope of concrete.
The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment
insofar as possible.
      (8)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and
connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s)
shall indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly
be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. Fees for connection
shall be as established by the city.
      (9)   The owner shall ensure that all excavations for building sewer
installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard.
      (10)   Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed
in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the
city.
      (11)   In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low
to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building
sewer. Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary drainage shall be
above basement floor or in a separate watertight or drained sun-Ip or channel.
      (12)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent and
all such trenches shall be kept open until the pipe has been inspected, tested
and approved by the Superintendent. Except where bends are supplied, trenches
shall be straight in direction and grade to accommodate prefabricated joints.
Trenches shall be at least 20 inches wide at right angles to the center line of
the pipe. Building sanitary sewers laid in undisturbed ground must be laid on
at least six inches of pea gravel, sand or other approved grillage to support
the pipe. The trench shall be filled with the same approved grillage on each
side of the pipe and six inches over same. Building sewers laid in mud or
filled ground shall be embedded to lower quadrant with at least a four inch
concrete pad below the invert or other support that may be considered
necessary. Backfill shall be carefully tamped in and around pipe in not over
four inch layers to top of pipe for proper support. Backfill shall be solidly
tamped above the pipe and hand placed up to 18 inches above the 16 inch pipe.
No backfill shall be placed over the pipe until the pipe laying has been
inspected by the Superintendent or his or her duly authorized agent.
      (13)   All joints and connections shall be made gas tight and water
tight. Joints for cast iron soil pipe and fittings with hubs and plain end
spigots shall be made with caulked lead and oakum as specified in Chapter 4,
ASA A40.8 or by using positive double-seal elastomeric compression-type gaskets
conforming to ASTM C-564. Service pipe shall be joined with service gaskets and
extra heavy pipe with extra heavy gaskets. All joints between vitrified clay
pipe and other approved pipe shall be made with an approved prefabricated
rubber or plastic material conforming to ASTM Specification C-425, latest
revision, and installed clean and uninjured by handling or weather according to
manufacturers’ direction, completely “homed” into place. The vitrified clay
sewer pipe shall be jointed with compressed watertight rubber rings meeting
ASTM Specification D-1869, latest revision, and installed clean, according to
manufacturers’ directions. The ductile iron pipe shall be joined together with
watertight rubber gaskets in accordance with the manufacturers’ directions. The
PVC pipe joints shall conform to ASTM D-3212, latest revision, and elastomeric
gaskets to ASTM F477.
      (14)   The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the
easement or property line. Where no properly located service branch is
available, an authorized agent of the City shall cut a neat hole into the main
line of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle installed to receive
the building sewer. The invert of the building sewer, at such point of
connection with a saddle, shall be in the upper quadrant of the main line of
the public sewer. A neat workmanlike connection not extending past the inner
surface of the public sewer shall be made and the saddle made secure and
watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A
wye and H bend fitting shall be installed at the property line between the
public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a
cleanout and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After
testing, a cast iron or ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and
brought flush with the ground surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type
joint applicable to the pipe used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion
of ground or surface water.
      (15)   All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet
or exceed the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code.
      (16)   All persons working on city sewers with a cleaning rod must use an
approved type rod in cleaning sewer connections to City sewers.
   (D)   Inspection.
      (1)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
Superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection
to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the
supervision of the Superintendent or his representative. All connections shall
be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation
from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the
Superintendent before installation.
      (2)   All building sewers shall be smoke tested through the wye branch at
the public sewer connection or low pressure air tested per ASTM C-828-08, or
latest revision, with public sewer tightly plugged off after connections at
both ends are made and after all pipe is properly bedded and backfilled at
least to top of pipe and if backfill is completed, within two weeks after
completion of backfill. At time of test any openings into the building drain
inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any leakage of smoke
from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be located at test and
repaired to stand repetition of smoke test without leakage. When smoke testing
is completed, the temporary flow line plug shall be removed and a permanent
water tight plug shall be placed in branch of test wyebranch and carefully
backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six inches above the top of the
branch. The Superintendent shall determine the method of testing to be
performed.

applicable state and federal regulations governing such discharge.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.020 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40
C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the WTS
may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with divisions
(E) and (F) of this section.
   (B)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the WTS may convert
the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant
discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
   (C)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the WWS shall impose
an alternate limit in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e).
   (D)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical Pretreatment
Standard in accordance with the following divisions of this section.
      (1)   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user’s intake water in accordance with
this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial
user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a “net” basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of division (D)(2) of this section are met.
      (2)   Criteria.
         (a)   Either (i) The applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 C.F.R. subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be
applied on a net basis; or (ii) The industrial user demonstrates that the
control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment
standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the Standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
         (b)   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the user’s effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
         (c)   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
         (d)   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
   (E)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert
the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the WWS. The
city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all
the conditions set forth in divisions (E)(1)(a) through (E)(1)(e) of this
section.
      (1)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
         (a)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facilities
actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility’s long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         (d)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         (e)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user’s request
for equivalent mass limits.
      (2)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         (a)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         (b)   Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         (c)   Continue to record the facility’s production rates and notify
the Wastewater Supervisor whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in division (E)(1)
(c) of this Section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the WWS
will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         (d)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division (E)(1)(a) of
this Section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      (3)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the WWS:
         (a)   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         (b)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (c)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user’s actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to this
section. The industrial user must also be in compliance with §
54.192 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   (F)   (1)   The WWS may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 C.F.R. Parts 414,419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the WWS.
      (2)   [Note: When converting such limits to concentration limits, the WWS
will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 C.F.R.
Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for
treatment as prohibited by §
54.020 of this chapter (see 40 C.F.R. 403.6(d)). In addition, the WWS will
document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from
concentration to mass limits, or vice versa, and make this information publicly
available (see 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(7)).]
   G.   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
[Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(7)]
   (H)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
[Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(8)]
   (I)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall
notify the WTS within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis
to know that the production level will significantly change within the next
calendar month. Any user not notifying the WWS of such anticipated change will
be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were
based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. [Note:
See 40 C.F.R. 403.6(C)(9)]

(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.022 LOCAL LIMITS.
   (A)   The following is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40
C.F.R. 403.5(c).
   (B)   (1)   The following pollutant limits are established to protect
against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater
containing in excess of the following daily maximum limits.
arsenic             0.72 mg/l
cadmium             0.01 mg/l

silver              0.29 mg/l
zinc                2.61 mg/l
 
      (2)   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is
discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for
total metal unless indicated otherwise. The WWS may impose mass limitations in
addition to the concentration-based limitations above.
   (C)   (1)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (2)   Any water or waste which has characteristics based on a 24-hour
composite sample, or a shorter period composite sample if more representative,
which exceed the following normal maximum domestic wastewater parameter
concentrations:
 
Parameter  Max. Daily Concentrations (mg/l)
BOD        1,500 mg/l
TSS        500 mg/l
Oil/grease 100 mg/
Ammonia    40 mg/l

§ 54.023 CITY OF FALMOUTH’S RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The City of Falmouth reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in
individual wastewater discharge permits more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this
chapter.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.024 DILUTION.
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The WWS may
impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of
mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER
§ 54.035 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
54.015 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state,
or WWS, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed
plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the WWS for review, and shall be acceptable to the WWS before such facilities
are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City of Falmouth under the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.036 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the WWS may require users to restrict their
discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and
such other conditions as maybe necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Wastewater Supervisor may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An
individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
   (C)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the WWS, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater
containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the WWS, shall comply with
the City of Falmouth’s Oil and Grease Management ordinance once it’s
established shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the
user at their expense.
   (D)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances maybe
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

§ 54.037 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUDGE DISCHARGE CONTROL PLANS.
   The WWS shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug
discharge control plan or other action to control sludge discharges. The WWS
may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan
or take such other action that maybe necessary to control sludge discharges.
Alternatively, the WWS may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/sludge discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
   (A)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
   (B)   Description of stored chemicals;
   (C)   Procedures for immediately notifying the WWS of any accidental or
sludge discharge, as required by §
54.095 of this chapter; and
   (D)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or sludge
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.

immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.096 REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports to the WWS as the WWS may require.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.097 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the WWS within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to WWS within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the
industrial user is not required if the City of Falmouth performs sampling at
the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the City of Falmouth performs
sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted
and the time when the user or the City of Falmouth receives the results of this
sampling, or if the City of Falmouth has performed the sampling and analysis in
lieu of the industrial user.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.098 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the waste-stream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
waste-stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
54.094 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
54.090, 94.092, and 54.093 of this chapter.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) of this
section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the WWS, the EPA Regional
Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities
of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.099 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and
amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA
determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the WWS
or other parties approved by EPA.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.100 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   (A)   Except as indicated in divisions (B) and (C) of this section , the
user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the WWS. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative
of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field: for volatile organics and oil
and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples
for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City of Falmouth, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
Instantaneous Limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §§
54.090 and
54.092 (40 C.F.R. 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist: for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the WWS
may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by §
54.093(40 C.F.R. 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

§ 54.101 DATE OF RECEIPT OF REPORTS.
   Written reports must be received on the date they are due.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.102 RECORDKEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated with best management practices established under §
54.018(C) Section 2.4 C. Records shall include the date, exact place, method,
and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the
dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall
be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user or the City of Falmouth, or where the user has been specifically notified
of a longer retention period by the WWS.

taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 45 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice maybe served on any authorized representative of the user
as defined in §
54.004 and required by §
54.056(A). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.143 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the WWS finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the WWS
may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come
into compliance within the time provided, sewer service maybe discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances
are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)

provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that
the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the WWS may issue an order to
the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.

assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other
long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during
the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 12% the legal rate of the unpaid balance, and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate 12% per month the legal rate. A lien
against the user’s property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and
penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the WWS to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
WWS may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The WWS may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.146 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   The WWS may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to
the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The WWS may also
immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
   (A)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the WWS may take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The WWS may allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the WWS that
the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
54.147 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   (B)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the WWS prior to the date of any show cause
or termination hearing under §
54.142 or §
54.147 of this chapter.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 54.190 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the WWS within
24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally,
a written . submission must be provided within five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.191 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
54.015(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in sections 2.1(B)(3)
through section (B)(16) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 2017-72.01d, passed 2-27-17)
§ 54.192 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section:
      (1)   “BYPASS” means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user’s treatment facility.
      (2)   “SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE” means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. “SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE” does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   Bypass notifications.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the WWS least ten days before the date of the bypass, if
possible.

bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The WWS may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report
has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the WWS may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The WWS may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the WWS determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

facilities and system.
      (6)   County/local taxes/regulations. The applicant must comply with all

      (7)   Additional requirements.
         (a)   Supplementary, additional or other information that the

         (b)   Applications may be modified at any time prior to the opening of
the applications, provided that any modifications must be duly executed in the
manner that the applicant's application must be executed.
         (c)   A copy of the applicant's certificate of authority from the

         (g)   The information provided by applicant shall be certified as true

material changes to the information provided in the completed application
during the term of any franchise.
      (8)   Supplementation to applications. The city reserves the right to
require such supplementary, additional or other information that it deems
reasonably necessary for its determinations.
      (9)   The city's rights reserved. The city reserves the right to waive
all formalities and/or technicalities where the best interest of the city may
be served, provided that it shall exercise this right in a nondiscriminatory
and competitively neutral manner.
   (E)   Standards and procedures for approval or renewal of franchises.
Franchises shall be granted in accordance with Kentucky Constitution Sections
163 and 164. The city shall grant franchises or renewals to any eligible
franchisee for the right and privilege to construct, own, operate, repair,
replace and maintain facilities in, through and along the city's rights-of-way
for the purposes of providing communications service on a nonexclusive basis
within the city, subject, however, to the standards, terms and conditions
herein set forth within this chapter, and any special conditions as may be
provided for in the franchise. All franchisees shall be required to obtain and
maintain any necessary and lawful permit, license certification, grant,
registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate
governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the city, the FCC and the
PSC.
   (F)   Acceptance and effective date of franchise. Any franchise granted
hereunder, together with the rights, privileges and authority granted thereby,
shall take effect and be in force from and after the effective date of an
ordinance granting a franchise hereunder, provided that on or before that date
franchisee shall:
      (1)   Enter into and execute such agreements and documents as required by
the city that are consistent with the terms and provisions of this chapter and
applicable law;
      (2)   File such bond or bonds as required in this chapter; and
      (3)   Advise the city in writing of franchisee's address for mail and
official notifications from the city.
   (G)   Use of rights-of-way; police powers; franchisee's use subordinate. A
franchisee shall construct and maintain its facilities in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local laws, including all permit requirements and
associated fee payments, and all other city codes and ordinances in effect as
of the date of the award of its franchise or thereafter adopted or amended, to
the extent permitted by state or federal law, subject to §
55.01(D). The grant of a franchise does not in any way affect the continuing
authority of the city, through the proper exercise of its Home Rule or
statutory powers, to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to provide for the
health, safety and welfare of the public. The city makes no express or implied
representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation
or construction of facilities on any particular segment of rights-of-way. The
burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of
construction or installation shall be entirely upon the franchisee. The use of
the rights-of-way authorized by any franchise shall in all matters be
subordinate to the city's lawful use and rights therein, without limiting the
generality of the following:
      (1)   All rights and privileges granted herein are subject to the police
powers of the city and its rights under applicable laws and regulations to
regulate the construction, operation, and maintenance of franchisee's system,
subject to § 55.01(D), including, but not limited to, the right to adopt and
enforce additional ordinances and regulations as the city shall find necessary
in the exercise of its police powers, the right to adopt and enforce applicable
zoning, building, permitting and safety ordinances and regulations, the right
to adopt and enforce regulations relating to equal employment opportunities,
and the right to adopt and enforce ordinances and regulations concerning the
rights-of-way and utility standards.
      (2)   The city reserves the right to exercise its police powers. Any
conflict between the provisions of this chapter or a franchise and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers shall be resolved
in favor of the police powers.
      (3)   Franchisee shall not be excused from complying with any of the
requirements of this chapter, or any subsequently adopted and lawfully binding
amendments to this chapter, by any failure of the city on any one or more
occasions to seek, or insist upon, compliance with such requirements or
provisions.
   (H)   Emergencies.
      (1)   Franchisee shall assign a management level individual to coordinate
with, and assist, the city in the development of emergency plans.
      (2)   If at any time, in case of fire or disaster or other emergency
situation in the city, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of
the city to cut raise, lower, or relocate any facilities, such cutting,
raising, lowering, or relocating may be done, and any repairs rendered
necessary thereby shall be made by franchisee, at its sole expense. Nothing in
this chapter shall prohibit or limit any rights of a franchisee under
applicable law to recover its reasonable costs incurred pursuant to this
division (H) to cut, raise, lower, or relocate facilities from the person(s)
responsible for the fire, disaster, or other emergency situation.
   (I)   Term. Any franchise created herein by this chapter shall continue for
a period of ten years from and after the effective date of the franchise
agreement between the parties. The city may, by ordinance, extend the terms of
any franchise agreement awarded pursuant to this chapter by no more than two
five-year periods for a total franchise term of no more than 20 years.
   (J)   Franchise fees.
      (1)   Franchisees shall pay a franchise fee to the city, which shall be
the greater of either: (i) 5% of franchisee's gross revenue; or (ii) $270.00
per antenna in the rights-of-way and shall be payable as follows:
         (a)   The payment of the franchise fee shall be in addition to any
other tax or payment owed to the city by franchisee, subject to applicable law.
         (b)   If the franchise fee payment is based on gross revenues, the
franchise fee shall be payable quarterly to the city, and the franchisee shall
file a complete and accurate report, signed by and certified as accurate by a
financial representative of the franchisee. If the franchise fee payment is
based on gross revenues, the report shall contain all gross revenues received
within the territorial limits of the city during the previous three-month
period; said payment shall be remitted to the city no later than 45 days after
the expiration of the quarter due. The gross revenue report from operations of
the franchisee within the franchise area shall be prepared by a qualified
financial representative in accordance with generally acceptable accounting
principles and shall include a quarterly schedule of gross revenue by category
and a schedule of gross revenue upon which the franchise fee is based.
         (c)   If the franchise fee payment is based on the number of antennas
in the city, the franchise fee shall be payable annually to the city, and the
franchisee shall file a complete and accurate report, signed by and certified
as accurate by a financial representative of the franchisee. The report should
include the number of antennas in the city during the previous year period, and
said payment shall be remitted to the city no later than February 15 of the
year due.
         (d)   Upon 30 days' written notice, the city shall have the right to
inspect the records relating to gross revenues and/or the number of antennas at
a mutually agreed upon location, as well as the right to audit and re-compute
any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter; provided, however,
that such audit shall take place within 12 months following the close of each
of the franchisee's fiscal years. If, as a result of such inspection, the city
determines that franchisee has underpaid its fees in any 12- month period by 5%
or more, then, in addition to making full payment of the relevant obligation,
franchisee shall reimburse the city for all of the verifiable, out of pocket
costs associated with the audit or review, including costs for attorneys and
accountants. Any additional undisputed amount due to the city as a result of an
audit or review shall be paid within the 30 days following written notice to
the franchisee by the city, which notice shall include a copy of the audit
report and copies of all invoices for which the city seeks reimbursement.
         (e)   In the event that any franchise fee payment or recomputed amount
is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest
shall accrue from such date at the rate of prime plus 1% per annum, for the
period of delinquency.
      (2)   The city reserves the right to require the franchisee to collect
any consumer or other tax or other fee that may be imposed by the city, the
Commonwealth of Kentucky, or the federal government on communication services.
The city acknowledges that such items may be reflected as separate line items
on subscribers' bills.
      (3)   Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter, upon 120 days'
notice to franchisees, the city may opt to set any franchise fees at the
maximum amount allowed under applicable law.
   (K)   No accord and satisfaction. No acceptance by the city of any franchise
fees or any other payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid
is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fees or
any other payment be construed as a release of any claim of the city.
   (L)   Franchise fees not a tax; payment of taxes. The franchise fees are
compensation for the use of the rights-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a
tax of any kind. The franchise fees required herein shall be in addition to,
not in lieu of, any and all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and
impositions otherwise applicable to franchisee that are or may be imposed by
the city. A franchisee shall be fully responsible for the payment of all
applicable taxes.
   (M)   Description of communications service. During the term of the
franchise, franchisee shall provide the city with a description of any material
changes to the types of communications service offered over its facilities in
the rights-of-way within the city during the prior year. Any individual
communications service or item for which the franchisee has a separate charge
shall be considered a separate communications service.
   (N)   Assignment of franchise. A franchisee shall provide the city with
written notice of any transfer or assignment of the franchise. A franchisee
shall not sell, assign, sublet, dispose of or otherwise transfer a franchise
(or any of the rights or privileges granted by such franchise), franchisee's
system, or control of franchisee to another entity other than by operation of
law or to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
the franchisee, without the prior written consent of the city, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required, however,
for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment
of any rights, title, or interest of the franchisee in the franchise or system
to secure indebtedness. No transfer of control of the franchisee defined as an
acquisition of 51% or greater ownership interest in franchisee shall take place
without the prior written consent of the city. The city's consent to such a
transfer shall not be withheld if the acquiring entity would have qualified for
an original franchise had it applied and if the acquiring entity demonstrates
it has the same or equivalent insurance coverage and bonds in place as was
required of the original franchisee. Nothing in any approval by the city of any
transfer pursuant to this section shall be construed to waive, release or
delegate any rights or powers of the city to hold the original franchisee
liable for any violation of its franchise.
   (O)   Forfeiture of franchise and privilege. In case of failure on the part
of a franchisee, its successors and assigns, to comply with any of the material
provisions of this chapter or its franchise, or if the franchisee, its
successors and assigns, should do or cause to be done any material act or thing
prohibited by or in material violation of this chapter or the terms of its
franchise, the franchisee, its successors and assigns, shall forfeit all rights
and privileges permitted by this chapter and its franchise, and all rights
hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, provided that said
forfeiture shall not take effect until the city shall carry out the proceedings
specified in § 55.10(B).
   (P)   Security for payment of fees. Every franchisee shall provide to the
city an irrevocable letter of credit or deposit of cash in the amount of
$25,000.00 or one half of the annual franchise fees owed, whichever is less, to
secure the payment of the franchise fees for the first two years in which the
franchisee is subject to a franchise fee. If, thereafter, there has been no
default in paying the franchise fees nor any late payment of the franchise
fees, the letter of credit shall be released or cash deposit returned.
(Ord. 2024.2, passed 3-5-24)
§ 55.03 RIGHTS-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT AND FACILITIES REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Encroachment permit. A franchisee shall be subject to and comply with
this code and any additional or supplementary terms and conditions of any
encroachment on rights-of-way permit, as may be amended from time to time,
subject to §
55.01(D).
   (B)   Removal of facilities. Upon expiration of a franchise, whether by
lapse of time, by agreement between the franchisee and the city, or by
forfeiture thereof, the franchisee shall remove, at its sole cost, from the
rights-of-way any and all of its Facilities that are the subject of such
franchise within a reasonable time after such expiration, not to exceed 90
days, and, it shall be the duty of the franchisee immediately upon such removal
to restore the rights-of-way from which the facilities are removed to as good
condition as the same were before the removal was effected and as required by
the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may allow facilities to be
left in place when the city determines in its sole discretion that it is not
practical or desirable to require removal. Said removal shall be in compliance
with this code and any additional or supplementary terms and conditions of any
removal, as may be amended from time to time, subject to §
55.01(D).
   (C)   Relocation of facilities. Whenever the city shall, in its exercise of
the public interest, request that the franchisee relocate or reinstall any of
its facilities, the franchisee shall, upon ten days' written notice, remove,
relocate, or reinstall any such facilities as may be reasonably necessary to
meet the request. The cost of such relocation, removal, or reinstallation of
the facilities shall be the exclusive obligation of the franchisee. Upon
request of any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a
validly issued building or moving permit of the city, a franchisee shall,
within ten days, temporarily raise, lower, or relocate its wires or other
facilities as may be required for the person to exercise the rights under the
permit; however, the franchisee may require such permit holder to make payment
to franchisee in advance for any expenses incurred by the franchisee to
temporarily move its facilities pursuant to such person's request. To the
extent that any utility or other right-of-way occupant is required to remove or
relocate its facilities as part of the same of related right-of-way alteration,
route or location change affecting franchisee, franchisee shall not be treated
in a discriminatory manner relative to such utilities. Franchisee shall receive
no less advance notice and shall be provided the same right to reimbursement
for removing or relocating its facilities as any utility receives from the
city.
   (D)   Franchisee responsible for costs. A franchisee shall be responsible
for all reasonable costs incurred by the city that are directly associated with
the franchisee's erecting, installing, maintaining, operating, repairing,
replacing, removing or restoring its facilities in the rights-of-way. A
franchisee shall be responsible for its own costs incurred in removing or
relocating its facilities when required by the city due to the city
requirements relating to maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for the city
purposes.
   (E)   Insurance and bonds. During the term of any franchise, a franchisee
shall obtain and maintain at its sole expense all insurance and bonds required
by this chapter. It is expressly understood that the city does not in any way
represent that the specified limits of liability or coverage or policy forms
are sufficient or adequate to protect the interest or liabilities of
franchisee.
      (1)   Franchisee shall file with the city a franchise bond in the amount
of $25,000.00, which shall be required to be in place for the entire term of
the franchise. Additionally, a franchisee seeking to construct or install a
system in the city shall file with the city a performance bond in an amount to
be determined by the city, provided that said amount shall not exceed the
actual cost of the construction project. In no event shall the amount of the
performance bond required by the city exceed the reasonable costs of repairing
the rights-of-way in the event of non-performance by the franchisee. The
performance bond shall provide for the faithful performance of construction and
installation of franchisee's system. Two years after demonstration of the
completion of the construction of the system by franchisee to the city, the
city shall release the performance bond.
      (2)   The performance bond shall indemnify the city, in its own right and
as trustee, from any damages or losses arising out of the failure of franchisee
to faithfully perform and satisfactorily complete construction of the system in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The failure of franchisee to comply with its obligations under this
chapter or the franchise, as determined by the city, shall entitle the city to
draw against either or both of franchisee's performance and franchise bonds,
subject to § 55.10(B).
      (4)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the performance and
franchise bonds required hereunder are in addition to all other rights of the
city, whether reserved by this chapter or authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such performance or franchise
bonds shall affect any other rights the city may have.
      (5)   Unless otherwise released by the city, the performance or franchise
bonds required hereunder shall not expire or be materially altered without 30
days' written notice and without securing and delivering to the city a
substitute, renewal and replacement bond in conformance with this chapter. In
the event the city does draw monies against the performance bond required
hereunder, within ten days thereafter, franchisee shall pay such funds to the
bonding company as necessary to bring said performance and/or franchise bonds
back to the applicable principal, where it shall continue to be maintained. The
performance and franchise bonds required hereunder shall contain the following
endorsements:
         "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be reduced,
altered or canceled by Franchisee or Surety without thirty (30) days' written
notice, by certified mail, to the City of Falmouth. Such termination or
cancellation shall have no effect on any liability incurred or accrued under
this bond prior to the effective date of such termination or cancellation."
      (6)   Immediately upon the effective date of the ordinance granting a
franchise under this chapter, franchisee shall file with the city the following
proof of liability insurance issued by a company(ies) authorized to do business
in the Commonwealth of Kentucky with an AM Best Rating of "A minus" (A-) or
better:
         (a)   General Liability Insurance, via an occurrence form, covering
bodily injury, including death, personal injury and property damage, and
including completed operations, contractual liability, independent contractors'
protective liability and personal injury liability protection. The minimum
acceptable limit of liability amount is $3,000,000.00 per occurrence and
aggregate under a combined single limit. This policy must include the city,
including its Mayor and City Council members, officials, boards, members,
agents, and employees, as additional insureds as respects all operations of the
insured franchisee. The city reserves the right to make reasonable increases in
the required amount of insurance coverage herein at any time, subject to §
55.05(A)(2) of this chapter. Nothing herein is intended as a limitation on the
extent of any legal liability of the franchisee.
         (b)   Automobile Liability, insuring all owned, non-owned and hired
motor vehicles of franchisee. The minimum coverage liability limit shall be
$1,000,000.00 combined single limit for any one accident. The limit of
liability may be subject to increase according to any applicable state or
federal transportation regulations.
         (c)   Workers' Compensation (if applicable), insuring the employers'
obligations under KRS Ch. 342 at statutory limits.
      (7)   Franchisee shall maintain on file with the city a certificate of
insurance certifying the coverage required under this chapter, which
certificate shall be subject to the approval of the city as to the adequacy of
the certificate and of the insurance certified under the requirements of this
chapter. Such certificate shall be identified on its face by the name of
franchisee, and shall be submitted to the city, in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this chapter. Failure to maintain adequate insurance as
required under this chapter shall be deemed a breach of the franchise, subject
to the notice and cure provisions in § 55.10(B).
      (8)   The city reserves the right to make reasonable increases in the
amount of insurance coverage referred to in this section at any time, subject
to § 55.05(A)(2) of this chapter.
      (9)   The following clause shall be added to franchisee's Commercial
General Liability Policies: "The City of Falmouth, its elected and appointed
officials, employees, agents and successors are added as an "additional
insured" as respects operations of the Named Insured performed relative to the
Franchise."
   (F)   Permits. Prior to performing any construction or installation work in
the public rights-of-way, franchisee shall apply to the city for any necessary
permit(s) and shall include descriptive information about the specific location
of any lines, facilities, boxes, or related equipment. All terms and conditions
of the permit application shall apply and be adhered to. In the case of
emergencies, the franchisee may perform critical work and at its earliest
opportunity seek any required permit(s) and submit any applicable fees.
      (1)   Franchisee shall furnish detailed plans of the work to be done
within the rights-of-way and provide other such information as required by the
city.
      (2)   Franchisee shall coordinate any construction work within the
rights-of-way with the city and shall begin construction work only after
approval by the city, unless work is performed under emergency operations.
      (3)   All permits issued by the city shall be available for inspection by
city personnel at the indicated work site.
   (G)   Notification. Franchisee shall notify the city, in writing or by
electronic mail or, at least 15 days prior to non-emergency construction. Such
written notification shall contain the location of the construction, the
starting date and the estimated completion date.
   (H)   Standards. Any work required or performed pursuant to this chapter
shall be done in accordance with federal, state and local law, and the National
Electric Safety Code.
      (1)   In the event that franchisee leases space on the poles or in the
conduits of an electric or other utility, franchisee shall abide by the
construction and other requirements of that utility, and the granting of a
franchise by the city shall not be construed or interpreted in any way to
alleviate franchisee's responsibilities and obligations to a pole or conduit
owner on whose poles and/or conduit franchisee leases space.
      (2)   Franchisee, its contractors, sub-contractors and anyone directly or
indirectly employed by franchisee shall conduct such operations so as to
promote and preserve the public safety and general welfare of the citizens of
the city.
      (3)   All construction, installation or maintenance by franchisee shall
be completed with diligence and with respect to all interests and rights of the
public.
   (I)   Traffic. Franchisee's work in the rights-of-way shall be accomplished
with a minimum of disruption and interference to the free flow of vehicular and
pedestrian traffic on the rights-of-way or public land.
      (1)   Franchisee shall maintain lanes of vehicular traffic in each
direction at all times during construction, installation or maintenance
activity.
      (2)   Traffic control devices to protect and control pedestrian and
vehicular traffic in any construction, maintenance or installation areas may be
prescribed by the city in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices or in accordance with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet traffic
control requirements when operating in a state right-of-way.
   (J)   Delay. Improvements to city rights-of-way conducted by the city or its
contractors shall not be delayed by any franchisee work authorized by this
chapter.
   (K)   Special exceptions. Any special exceptions granted shall be granted in
a non-discriminatory manner. The city may grant a special exception to the
requirements of this chapter if a franchisee, upon application, demonstrates
with written evidence that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare;
      (2)   The increased economic burden and the potential adverse impact on
franchisee's construction schedule resulting from the strict enforcement of the
requirement would actually or effectively prohibit the ability of franchisee to
provide communications service in the city; and
      (3)   The requirement unreasonably discriminates against franchisee in
favor of another comparable communications service provider.
   (L)   Inspections. All construction, installation and operation of
franchisee's system in the rights-of-way are subject to inspection by the city.
   (M)   Repair of sunken pavement over excavation. In case the pavement or the
surface of the rights-of-way over any excavation should become depressed or
broken at any time within five years after the excavation has been completed
and before resurfacing of the rights-of-way or any intervening excavation by
another entity, natural wear of the surface excepted, franchisee shall, upon
written notice from the city, immediately proceed to inspect the depressed or
broken area over the excavation to ascertain the cause of the failure.
Franchisee shall make repairs to the installation or backfill and have the
pavement restored, as specified by the city, within such reasonable time
period; however, said time period shall not be less than ten calendar days, as
may be specified by the city. If the pavement is not restored as specified by
the city and within the time period specified by the city, and unless delayed
by a strike or conditions beyond franchisee's control, the city may cause the
work to be done after giving franchisee 24 hours' final notice. The cost
thereof, including, but not limited to, any inspection costs and administrative
overhead incurred by the city, shall be assessed against franchisee.
   (N)   In the event that the use of any part of the system is discontinued
for any reason by any franchisee for a continuous period of 12 months, or in
the event such system or facility has been installed in rights-of-way without
complying with requirements of this chapter or the rights granted hereunder
have been terminated, cancelled or have expired, the franchisee shall promptly
remove from the rights-of-way all such facilities of such system, other than
any which the city may permit to be abandoned in place. In the event of such
removal, the franchisee shall promptly restore the rights-of-way from which
such facilities have been removed to a condition satisfactory to the city. Any
facilities of a franchisee to be abandoned in place shall be abandoned in such
manner as the city may prescribe. Upon a permanent abandonment of the
facilities of a franchisee in place, the franchisee shall submit to the city an
instrument to be approved by the city, transferring to the city the ownership
of such facilities.
   (O)   During any phase of construction, installation, maintenance or repair
of the system, the franchisee shall use materials of good and durable quality.
All such work shall be performed in a safe, thorough and reliable manner and in
compliance with city ordinances and regulations, as amended.
(Ord. 2024.2, passed 3-5-24)
§ 55.04 MISCELLANEOUS.
   (A)   Administration of franchise. The city shall be responsible for the
continued administration of this chapter and any franchises granted hereunder.
   (B)   Non-enforcement by the city. A franchisee shall not be relieved of its
obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or its
applicable franchise by reason of any failure of the city to enforce prompt
compliance.
   (C)   Publication of notices. A franchisee shall be responsible for all
costs of publication that may be required with respect to its franchise or any
amendments or renewals thereto.
   (D)   Severability. If any material provision of this chapter or of any
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter is held by a court or other
competent governmental authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unlawful as conflicting with applicable laws now or hereafter in effect, or is
held by a court or competent governmental authority to be modified in any way
in order to conform to the requirements of any such applicable laws, such
provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of
this chapter or the franchise, and, to the extent possible, such holding shall
not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions herein or
therein.
(Ord. 2024.2, passed 3-5-24)
§ 55.05 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Existing franchises. Franchises previously granted shall be deemed to
continue through their current expiration date.
   (B)   Further amendments of the chapter shall be deemed accepted by a
franchisee unless, within 60 days of any further amendments, a franchisee
indicates in writing it does not accept the amendments as part of its
franchise. Upon such notice of non-acceptance, said franchisee and the city may
renegotiate or terminate the franchisee's franchise pursuant to all local,
state and federal law.
   (C)   The franchise shall contain such further conditions or provisions as
may be negotiated between the city and the franchisee. In the case of such
conflict or ambiguity between any terms or provisions of the franchise and this
chapter, the words of the franchise shall be deemed to control.
   (D)   Transitional provisions to be narrowly interpreted. It is the intent
of the city to apply the provisions of this chapter to all owners or operators
of communications systems with facilities, including local exchange carriers,
that now occupy or may in the future occupy rights-of-way, except to the extent

      (1)   The city may terminate any franchise in accordance herewith in the
event of the violation of any material provision hereof or of any rule or
regulation promulgated pursuant hereto or of any applicable federal, state, or
local law or the breach or other failure, refusal or neglect by the franchisee
to perform its obligations under the material terms and conditions of this
chapter or of any ordinance or agreement awarding a franchise in accordance
herewith, except when such violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect is
caused by any of the following:
         (a)   Act of God;
         (b)   Riot, insurrection, civil disturbance, sabotage or vandalism,
tampering or interference, act of public enemy, public health emergency,
accident, fire, flood, strike, unavailability of materials or equipment, war or

promulgated pursuant hereto, any applicable federal, state or local law or any

or said agreement, franchise or ordinance. The written demand shall set forth
the exact nature of the noncompliance. The franchisee shall have 60 days from
such notice to either object in writing, state its reasons for such objections
and provide any explanation or to cure the alleged noncompliance. If the city
has not received a satisfactory response from franchisee, or the violation,
breach, failure, refusal or neglect is not remedied to the satisfaction of the
city within 60 days following such demand, the city shall determine whether or
not, in its sole discretion, any violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect
by the franchisee was excusable or inexcusable as provided in division (B)(1)
of this section.
         (a)   If the city determines such violation, breach, failure, refusal
or neglect by the franchisee was excusable as provided in division (B)(1) of
this section, the city shall direct the franchisee to correct or remedy the
same within such additional time, in such manner and upon such terms and
conditions as are just and reasonable and as the city may direct.
         (b)   If the city determines such violation, breach, failure, refusal
or neglect by the franchisee was inexcusable, then City Council, by ordinance,
may seek to terminate the franchisee's franchise at a public hearing before the
City Council, and the City Council may provide a time period for the franchisee
to become compliant. If the city seeks to terminate franchisee's franchise, it

conducting a hearing. The hearing shall be on the record and transcribed, if
franchisee so elects and at franchisee's cost, and shall provide franchisee
full due process rights, including the right to state its position on the
matter, present evidence, and question witnesses. Franchisee may appeal any
decision made by the city after the hearing to an appropriate court. Nothing in
this chapter, including the provisions set forth in this section, shall prevent

breached pursuant to division (B)(2)(b) of this section, and the franchisee
either does not challenge the city's decision or city's decision is affirmed in

governing the consent of the city to such change in control of the franchisee
shall apply.

of the franchisee to file any of the reports required under this chapter or as
the city may direct, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and shall
subject the franchisee to the provisions of §
55.10, shall be deemed a material breach of any agreement or ordinance awarding
a franchise in accordance herewith, and shall subject the franchisee to all
penalties and remedies prescribed therein and to all other remedies, legal or
equitable, which are available to the city. Franchisee's delivery of any report
requested pursuant to this section shall cure any prior alleged refusal,
failure or neglect to file reports requested and required under this section.
   (C)   Any material misrepresentation made knowingly by the franchisee in any
report required under this chapter shall subject the franchisee to the
provisions of §

and of ascertaining the correctness of any and all reports and may examine
franchisee's officers and employees in respect thereto; provided, however, that
no audit shall occur more often than once in any given 12 month period of time.
   (C)   Any false entry in the books of account or record submitted to the
city, or false statements in reports to the city, as to material fact,
knowingly made by the franchisee, shall constitute a breach of a material
provision of this chapter and any franchise agreement or ordinance hereunder,
for which the remedies provided in this chapter may be invoked.

§ 55.14 TIME OF ESSENCE.
   Whenever this chapter, or any ordinance or agreement awarding a franchise
hereunder, shall set forth any time for any act to be performed by or on behalf
of a franchisee, such time shall be deemed of the essence, and any failure of a
franchisee to perform within the time set forth shall constitute a material
breach of the terms of this chapter and shall entitle the city to invoke all
penalties and remedies prescribed in this chapter as well as all other legal or
equitable remedies available to the city.
(Ord. 2024.2, passed 3-5-24)
§ 55.15 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.

released to the owner or other person entitled to possession only upon proof of
ownership or right to possession. The city may require reasonable security,
bond or other assurances of indemnification from a person who is not the
registered owner of the vehicle prior to releasing the vehicle to such person.
   (D)   The owner of a motor vehicle which has been impounded pursuant to this
section or other person entitled to possession, may challenge the validity of
such impoundment and request in writing a hearing before the Falmouth Parking
Citation Enforcement Board. The hearing shall be conducted within ten business
days of the date of the request, unless the owner or other person entitled to
possession waives the limitation or the city shows good cause for such delay.
The city shall retain possession of the vehicle pending the hearing, unless the
owner or other person claiming right of possession posts a bond in an amount
equal to the fines and fees accrued as of the date of the hearing request, or
$75 whichever is less. If the owner or person claiming possession of the
vehicle is unable to pay the amount of the bond, the hearing shall be held
within 72 hours of the date the request for hearing is received, unless such
person requests or agrees to a continuance.
   (E)   (1)   No less than five days prior to the date set for the hearing,
the city shall notify the person requesting the hearing of the date, time and
place of the hearing. In the case of a hearing required to be held within 72
hours of the date of the request as provided in subsection (D) of this section,
the person requesting the hearing shall be informed at the time of his request,
or as soon thereafter as is practicable, of the date and time of the hearing.
      (2)   Any person who refuses or, except for good cause, fails to appear
at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have conceded on
his/her/its and the owner’s behalf the validity of the impoundment.
      (3)   At the hearing, after consideration of the evidence, the Board
shall determine whether the impoundment was valid and reasonable. Where it has
not been established that the impoundment was justified, an order releasing the
vehicle shall be entered. All fines and fees paid or amounts posted as bond
because of the impoundment of the vehicle shall be returned. Where it has been
established that the impoundment was justified, the Board shall uphold the
impoundment and condition the release of the vehicle upon payment of all fines
and fees accruing thereto. If bond has been posted as security for release of
the vehicle, said bond shall be forfeited to the city. Any fines or fees in
excess of the amount of the bond posted shall be ordered to be paid by the
owner of the vehicle to the city. The Board shall furnish the owner or person
appearing on the owner’s behalf with a copy of its order.

report made under oath by the issuing officer in lieu of the officer’s personal
appearance at the hearing.
      (5)   An appeal from the Falmouth Parking Citation Enforcement Board’s
determination may be made to the Pendleton District Court within seven days of
the Board’s determination. The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a
complaint and a copy of the Board’s order in the same manner as any civil
action. The action shall be tried de novo and the burden shall be on the City
of Falmouth to establish that impoundment was justified. If the court finds
that the impoundment was justified, the owner shall be ordered to pay all fees
and fines accruing as of the date of judgment. If the court finds that the
impoundment was not justified, the city shall be ordered to release the
vehicle, if applicable, and to return all fines and fees paid as a result of
the impoundment and the plaintiff shall be authorized to recover his/her/its
costs.

Court in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.

tubes are separated from each other on the base by a distance of at least ½
inch.
         (e)   Wheel. A device attached to a post or tree by means of a nail or
string. A wheel may have one or more drivers, each of which may contain not
more than 60 grams of pyrotechnic composition. No wheel may contain more than
200 grams total pyrotechnic composition. Upon ignition, the wheel revolves,
producing a shower of color and sparks and, sometimes, a whistling effect.
         (f)   Ground spinner. Small device containing not more than 20 grams
of pyrotechnic composition, similar in operation to a wheel but intended to be
placed on the ground and ignited. A shower of sparks and color is produced by
the rapidly spinning device.
         (g)   Flitter sparkler. Narrow paper tube attached to a stick or wire
and filled with not more than 100 grams of pyrotechnic composition that
produces color and sparks upon ignition. The paper at one end of the tube is
ignited to make the device function.
         (h)   Toy smoke device. Small plastic or paper item containing not
more than 100 grams of pyrotechnic composition that, upon ignition, produces
white or colored smoke as the primary effect.
      (2)   Aerial devices.

grams of pyrotechnic composition. Upon ignition, up to 10 stars (pellets of
pressed pyrotechnic composition that burn with bright color) are individually
expelled at several second intervals.
         (e)   Mine, shell. Heavy cardboard or paper tube usually attached to a
wood or plastic base and containing up to 60 grams of total chemical
composition (lift charge, burst charge, and visible or audible effect
composition). Upon ignition, “stars,” components producing reports containing
up to 130 milligrams of explosive composition per report, or other devices are
propelled into the air. The term “MINE” refers to a device with no internal
components containing a bursting charge, and the term “SHELL” refers to a
device that propels a component that subsequently bursts open in the air. A
mine or shell device may contain more than one tube provided the tubes fire in
sequence upon ignition of one external fuse. The term “CAKE” refers to a dense-
packed collection of mine or shell tubes. Total chemical composition including
lift charges of any multiple tube devices may not exceed 200 grams. The maximum

of each license issued under this chapter. The license fee for the effective
date July 1, 2007, shall be 2%. Thereafter, the City Council shall annually
adopt at the budget adoption of each fiscal year such percentage rates as shall
be reasonably estimated to ensure full reimbursement to the city for the cost
of any additional policing, regulatory, or administrative expenses, relating to
the sale of alcoholic beverages. Such fees shall be an addition to any other
tax, fee, or license permitted by law, but a credit against such fee shall be
allowed in an amount equal to the license or fee imposed by this subchapter,
and such regulatory fee shall be applied annually.
   (B)   Payment of such fees shall accompany the tax returns approved for such
use by the city, and shall be submitted to the City ABC Administrator by the

annual license fee required under this subchapter shall be deducted each month
as a credit.
   (C)   Failure to pay such monthly remittance within ten days of the due date
constitutes a violation and subjects city licensee to suspension or revocation
of the city license by the City ABC Administrator.
   (D)   Penalty for failure to submit a tax return to the ABC Administrator by
the due date is $10 for each late return.
   (E)   Penalty for failure pay the monthly remittance by the due date is 20%

   (A)   It is necessary that a city licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by the city license for which provision is made herein, or else the
city license will be declared dormant and become null and void after 90 days.
Such is the intent of this section. Realizing that a city licensee, like any
other business, may have his/her business interrupted by situations not under
his/her control, various exceptions to the dormancy rule have been included in
this section.
   (B)   Any city license under which no business is transacted during a period
of 90 days shall become null and void. At the expiration of the 90-day period,
the city license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
   (C)   Except that the provisions of division (A) hereof shall not apply to
any city licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for
which a city license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty,
death, the acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other
governmental agency or private corporation under the power of eminent domain,
whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through
failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Such city licensee shall furnish
to the City ABC Administrator a verified statement, setting forth the fact that
the city licensee is unable to continue in business prior to the expiration of
the 90 days of inactivity, for any of the reasons set forth herein, and the
City ABC Administrator may grant an extension of the dormancy, with the city
license continuing to remain in effect during the city license period or until
same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no
business is transacted during said period; provided, however, no such city
license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted thereunder
within 12 months from the date of notice to the City ABC Administrator. The
extension may not extend beyond the renewal day, but may be for such times as
the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of his sound
discretion.
   (D)   All renewal licenses must be on file with the City ABC Administrator,
as provided for in §
113.29 hereinabove, except where the city licensee is unable to continue in
business at the same premises licensed during the preceding city license paid
due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or
threatened acquisition of these premises by any federal, state, city or other
governmental agency or private corporation, possessing power of eminent domain,
whether such acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through
failure of landlord to renew existing lease; that said licensee shall file a
written verified statement no less than 30 days from the expiration date of
city license, setting forth these facts, and the City ABC Administrator is
hereby authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such city
license for a reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the City
ABC Administrator; provided, however, such city licensee shall pay a license
fee from the expiration date of the former license or licenses. The license fee
shall not be payable until application is made for the transfer of the city
license to a new location.

§ 150.15 APPEALS PROCESS.
   Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Building Inspector regarding the
issuance of a building permit may appeal the decision to the Board of
Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to vary the requirements for
issuance of a building permit, as set out herein, when the variance will not be
contrary to the public interest, and where, or into special conditions, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in
unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty. A variance from the terms of this
chapter shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
   (A)   A written application for a variance is submitted, by way of appeal,
demonstrating:
      (1)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure, or building involved and are which are not applicable
to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same area;
      (2)   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights, commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter;
      (3)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant;
      (4)   That granting the variance requested would not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same area.
   (B)   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in
the same area, and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or
buildings in other areas shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a
variance by the Board of Adjustment.
   (C)   Notice of a public hearing on the issue of appeal and grant of a
variance shall be given in accordance with the following conditions:
      (1)   Notice shall be given within 15 days in advance of the meeting at
which the public hearing is to be held, or of a special meeting for such public
hearing.
      (2)   The owner of the property for which the variance is sought, or his
or her agent, shall be notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or
registered mail.
      (3)   Notice of such hearing shall be posted on the property for which
the permit is sought at the City Hall or Court House, and in one other public
place at least 15 days prior to the public hearing.
      (4)   The public hearing shall be held in accordance with the open
meeting requirements of Kentucky Revised Statutes;
      (5)   Any party may appear in person or by counsel.
   (D)   Before granting such a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall make
findings that the requirements in division (A) of this section have been met by
the applicant for such variance, and shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application, and the evidence and proof received at
the public hearing, justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance
is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building, or structure; further, the Board shall find that the granting of a
variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter
and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the
public welfare.
   (E)   In granting any such variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter and punishable under §§
150.13 and
150.99 of the Code of Ordinances.
   (F)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance
to allow any use not permitted under the terms of this chapter in the area
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this chapter in the area.
   (G)   There shall be a fee of $500 for any appeal to the Board of Adjustment
to cover any expenses.

MANUFACTURED HOUSING
§ 151.15 INTERPRETATION.
   This subchapter regulating manufactured housing on developable building lots
in the city is to be interpreted and enforced in concert with city ordinance
requiring building permits, 90.03. In the event there is language conflict
between these documents, this subchapter language shall prevail.
(Ord. 90.04, passed 2-25-98)
§ 151.16 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A dwelling unit 60 feet or more in length and at least 12
feet or more in width when erected on site; 720 or more square feet of floor
area; designed for transportation after fabrication in one or more sections on
its own permanent chassis, to be used as a dwelling and arriving at the site
where it is placed on a foundation, or tied down and skirted with towing tongue
removed or completely disguised; floor area will not include accessory
structures or additions and shall be determined by measurement of the
structure’s exterior dimension after erection on site; and, such a unit
includes the connection to electric power, water supply and sewage disposal
facilities.
(Ord. 90.04, passed 2-25-98)
§ 151.17 SPECIFIC INSTALLATION AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The following obligations are imparted upon those who choose to locate a
manufactured housing unit in the city as of the date of final adoption of this
subchapter.
   (A)   A building permit is required for the establishment of a manufactured
home on an individual lot and in accordance with the provisions of city
ordinance 90.030 to include the building permit fee structure set forth in that
document. No manufactured housing unit shall be placed on a lot smaller than 50
feet X 100 feet (5000 square feet). Manufactured homes sited in the city must
be a minimum 60 feet in length and 12 feet in width. Manufactured homes sited
in the city must be constructed later than January 1, 1977. This requirement is
imposed due to safety features incorporated into manufactured housing resulting
from the National Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. This
Federal Act was enacted to improve the quality and durability of manufactured
homes and to reduce the number of injuries and deaths caused by manufactured
home accidents. A manufactured home title or a notarized statement must be
furnished as to provide proof of manufactured date. Manufacturer’s set up
installation instructions must be followed if available. In the event that the
manufacturer’s setup instructions differ from prescriptions outlined in this
subchapter, the municipality will, in most instances, defer to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
   (B)   Prior to the placement of a manufactured home on a developable
building lot, the person desiring the permit must make application and
participate in a pre-construction conference established to review the
manufactured home siting process. A plot map, showing the actual placement of
the manufactured home on the site, as well as noting other significant site
features such as the placement of accessory building or garage must be
developed and approved (See
Appendix A, describing plot map criteria, incorporated in and made a part of
this chapter).
   (C)   A manufactured home shall be in good repair at the time it is
installed. The city reserves the right to require a home inspection to ensure
that all manufactured home systems are operable as a placement precondition. No
material defect of any consequence should be noted as the home is placed upon a
lot. In the event defects are noted, necessary repairs must be made to remedy
the problem prior to certificate of occupancy issuance. Manufactured home
repairs or improvements must meet the National Manufactured Housing
Construction and Safety Act of 1974 and as these standards may have been
modified or otherwise updated.
   (D)   Exterior siding, roofing, and exterior covering material shall not be
out of character with surrounding structures.
   (E)   Manufactured homes shall be placed on a lot sufficient in size to
address the property set back requirements (See
Appendix B, defining and describing property setback requirements, incorporated
in and made a part of this chapter). Only one manufactured home per residential
lot. Manufactured homes will be placed on a lot with consideration for
mitigating any overhanging features that pose hazard such as telephone lines,
electric lines, tree branches. Any objects that may be an impediment to the
placement of manufactured home shall be removed or secured prior to certificate
of * occupancy issuance.
   (F)   The city and all property owners within 150 feet of the property site
must be notified, by applicant within 48 hours prior when the manufactured
housing will be installed on site.
   (G)   Manufactured homes may not be permitted on a building lot unless it
has been determined that property is free of encumbrances constituting health
or safety hazard including debris, exposed pipes, and the like. In the event
these obstacles or conditions are present, their containment, removal or
mitigation must occur prior to certificate of occupancy issuance.
   (H)   A traffic plan must be submitted to the city for review in advance of
the manufactured home mobilization, demonstrating the method of transporting
the manufactured home through the community to the location site.
   (I)   Manufactured home transportation and placement must occur between the
hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
   (J)   Prior to the placement of manufactured home on the site, the property
must be properly surveyed for determination of actual flood elevation. All
manufactured homes located in the city must be so sited that the elevation of
the lowest habitable floor of the structure or the lowest flood proofed
elevation is above the corresponding base flood elevation as priorly determined
for that property site. The height of the manufactured home shall be generally
limited to 40 inches from the ground level to the bottom of the main chassis.
Should that distance not be sufficient to meet flood elevation requirements,
the city reserves the right to require the property site to be built up with
compacted clean fill soil to a height that may satisfy flood elevation
guidelines while maintaining the maximum 40 inch distance requirements (This 40
inch maximum is not subject to variance consideration). The city may afford
opportunity for an increase in footings beyond a 40" height maximum, provided
the footings, anchoring, and tie down systems are engineered and the plans
detailing their construction and assemblage, are stamped by a licensed engineer
or architect. Additionally, that the skirting requirements covering the under
carriage are priorly approved. In the event the applicant cannot achieve the
desired flood elevation mitigation with footings not exceeding 40 inches and
choose not to comply with one of these two alternative mitigation solutions,
then the city will prohibit the manufactured home placement outright due to the
potential health and safety risk factors.
   (K)   All site preparation work to include grading, excavating and
foundation preparation must be accomplished prior to manufactured home
installation. Concrete blocks used to shore the understructure must be placed
on appropriate footings as to adequately distribute the load bearing weight.
Footings must be placed below frost line, generally to a depth 16 to 24 deep
inches below ground level. Wood support structures must also be placed on
appropriate footings (See
Appendix D, describing typical manufactured home installation guideline,
incorporated in and made a part of this chapter).
   (L)   All water and sewer work is to have been installed and inspected for
proper conveyance prior to certificate of occupancy issuance.
   (M)   All soil excavated and otherwise exposed, must be re-seeded as soon as
possible to ensure proper grass coverage. All piles of dirt must be removed or
graded level and construction debris eliminated prior to certificate of
occupancy issuance.
   (N)   Exterior covering material known as skirting shall be applied to all
manufactured homes in an aesthetically pleasing fashion so as to completely
cover the under carriage. Skirting material must be approved at the pre-
construction conference. The skirting and supporting framework must be of a
material not affected adversely by moisture. Concrete block foundations must be
firred and sheathed with an approved wood or metal skirting product. Skirting
constructed out of wood material must be painted or stained at the time the
manufactured home is sited and prior to certificate of occupancy issuance.
During inclement weather, a performance bond may compensate for necessary
skirting work. However, such work must be completed within 90 days of mobile
home placement on site. Skirting will be continuous as to ensconce the whole
dwelling unit. The same skirting material shall be applied the continuous
course of the application. Skirting shall have ventilation openings with a net
area of at least 1½ inches square per linear foot. The opening shall be
designed to provide cross ventilation on at least two approximately opposite
sides of the manufactured home. An opening will be constructed into the
skirting to provide inspectors access underneath the manufactured home. The
opening will be sufficient in size so that a fully equipped fire-person may
gain access underneath the manufactured home. It is assumed that the placement
of skirting around the manufactured home will not serve as to impede the
natural flow of water associated with flood prone areas. In the event that the
placement of skirting is determined to alter the water course as to increase
the prospect of flood hazard, then alternative skirt mitigating features will
be required.
   (O)   At least 75% of the area under the home must have 30 inches of
clearance between the bottom of the main chassis member and the ground level
and in no case less than 24 inches of clearance. Clearance heights greater than
40 inches above ground level must be approved at the pre-construction
conference and depending upon height and circumstance, may require engineering
approval.
   (P)   Every exit must have a landing and a set of stairs that meet code
requirement. Stair steps at least 36 inches wide will be constructed to access
doorways and exits. Stair stringer will be placed solidly on a permanent
concrete pad with dimensions four feet X four feet and three and one-half
inches deep. All steps will be properly secured to the manufactured home. The
doorway thresholds must properly align with the staircase landing. The steps
will ascend to a landing 36 inches X 36 inches. Stair treads will be nine
inches deep and risers will be eight inches high; no more than a quarter inch
deviation between stair riser heights and between tread lengths. Handrails will
be affixed to both sides of each stairway. Side handrails must tie into a
landing guardrail that is a constructed distance of 36 inches from the deck to
top of handrail (See stair case construction,
Appendix C, incorporated in and made a part of this chapter). Wrought iron may
substitute for wood handrails. Prefabricated concrete steps may substitute for
wood steps provided the associated measurements are generally in conformance
with the width and height measurements for stair steps set forth in this
subchapter.
   (Q)   Glass doors, (sliders) incorporated into the manufactured home require
a corresponding building deck covering an area at least 96 square feet. The
deck and accompanying steps shall be built of pretreated wood composition
supported by concrete pads or pier blocks. Deck material must be treated and
fastened with galvanized nail or screws. Decking must be installed using either
two inch X six inch or 5/4 inch X six inch dimensional lumber. Decking must be
affixed to floor joist on 16 inch centers, joist should be constructed from two
inch X eight inch dimensional lumber not to exceed 12 foot clear span. Deck
will be accessed by at least one stair case which must be set on a concrete pad
measuring four feet X four feet and three and one-half inches deep. Handrails
must be placed on both sides of the staircase and tie into a four inch X four
inch wood post. Stair treads will be nine inches deep, risers will be eight
inches high with no more than one-quarter inch deviancy between riser heights
and between tread lengths. Deck staircase material will be treated and stained
at time of installation and properly anchored to door. Handrails will be
established at a minimum 36 inch height from deck. Handrail posts will be
constructed from four inch X four inch treated wood material; guardrails will
be constructed from two inch X two inch wood material or greater and affixed on
six inch centers. Distance from deck to bottom of handrail cannot exceed four
inch. Openings: small enough that a four inch diameter sphere cannot pass
through (See
Appendix D, stair case construction).
   (R)   The manufactured home will be properly aligned on the building lot
with the length (narrow side) running parallel to the primary street and/or
generally complimenting nearby houses in terms of property line set back and
side back arrangement. Manufactured homes must be set back at least 25 feet
from the front and flanking street yards and placed in a manner reflecting a
general trend or pattern corresponding to adjacent housing alignments. Any
deviation from the 25 feet setback must be approved at time of pre-conference
meeting. The manufactured home must be placed at least eight feet from the side
yard lot line and ten feet back from the rear yard (See
Appendix B, covering setbacks).
   (S)   Garage must be built in a fashion that conforms with all applicable
building criteria and adhering to the same set back and side yard requirements
as the manufactured home. Construction of a garage requires a separate building
permit as do any other accessory structures located onsite.
   (T)   Building heights shall be limited to a height of 35 feet, antennas and
other projecting devices shall be limited to this same height, with the
exception of a flag pole.
   (U)   Street numbers of sufficient size and placement shall be affixed to
the dwelling unit in an easily read format readily discernible from the street.
   (V)   Illumination devices shall be installed upon a property in such a
manner as to avoid causing a nuisance impact upon the adjoining neighbor’s
property.
   (W)   Fences may be constructed out of wood or metal material. Front yard or
flanking street yard fence may not exceed a height of 48 inches and side yard
and back yard fences may be constructed to a height not to exceed six feet.
Side yard fences shall graduate from front bard fence height to side yard fence
height over a 20 foot span. No sight obstructing fence more than 36 inches in
height nor any non-sight obstruction fence (cyclone) more than 48 inches in
height may be erected and/or maintained within the required front yard or
required flanking street yard or any lot used for residential purpose. A
residential fence exceeding the height standards requires a variance.
   (X)   Property owner agrees as part of the manufactured home placement
process, not to protest their property’s inclusion into a utility local
improvement district or a road improvement district should those efforts be
pursued by public petition or city resolution.
   (Y)   All impervious surfaces that may result from the installation of
walkways and driveways shall be designed to divert storm waters away from
adjacent owner’s property.
   (Z)   Awning or roof attachments added to the manufactured home must have a
roof pitch greater than three inches in 12. Likewise, any garage or outbuilding
constructed shall have a similar roof pitch.
   (AA)   Garbage receptacles shall be kept within a screen enclosure
constructed of sight obscuring material.
   (BB)   Manufactured homes used for home occupancy shall be limited to
residential neighborhoods.
   (CC)   Curbs and sidewalks will be constructed as to align with similar
features on the adjoining properties so as to create continuous curbs and
walkways. No building permit shall be construed to give permission to obstruct
any public street or sidewalk unless specifically provided for in the order
granting the permit.
   (DD)   Construction work associated with curb cuts, driveway approaches, and

APPENDIX A: PLOT MAP CRITERIA
Any person desiring a building permit, as provided in this chapter, as well as
in ordinance 90.03, shall file with the Council of the city through the City
Clerk’s office a written and signed application, accurately describing the
nature of the improvements contemplated, the material to be used therein, the
particular location and the time work will commence and the probable duration
thereof.
Additionally, the person desiring the permit must participate in a pre-
construction conference established to review the manufactured home siting
process, and finnish a plot map showing the actual placement of the
manufactured home site, as well as other significant features such as the
placement of accessory building or a garage.
The Council or its designate may require any such application to be amended or
made more definite and certain, or may direct the filing of a new application.
Upon the filing of a proper application the Council may grant a permit in whole
or in part, as applied for, and may impose such reasonable conditions and terms
as may be deemed proper or the City Council may refuse to grant the permit.
Prior to approving any such application for a building permit the City Manager
and or designee, shall review the application, the proposed construction plan,
and if necessary visit the affected site. The City Manager or designee may
consider such application in the context of items impacting upon the public
health, welfare, and safety, including the ability of the city to provide
utility services occasioned by the improvement or construction. The
recommendations of the City Manager or designee shall be considered by the
Council at a properly convened special or regular meeting.

located on any lot that: (1) meets the standards required for the establishment
of a single family dwelling, and (2) lies in a zone in which a single family
dwelling is permitted use.
FRONT AND FLANKING STREET YARDS. No building shall be hereafter erected or
altered so that any portion thereof shall be nearer to the front or flanking
street property line than 25 feet.

not more than ten feet into a required front or flanking street yard.
·   Fireplaces may extend into a required front or flanking street yard a
distance of not more than 24 inches.
SIDE YARD. No building shall be hereafter erected or altered so that any
portion thereof shall be nearer to the side of lot line than eight feet.
Exceptions:
·   Eaves, cornices, and similar ornamentations may extend over a required side
yard set back for a distance of not more than two feet.
·   Platforms, terraces, and steps may extend not more than two feet into a
required side yard.

established from the inner edge of the private road rather than by reference to
the centerline of the right-of-way. Basements designated for future public
rights-of-way shall be treated the same as a public street for structure
setback purposes. Structure setbacks for uses that are adjacent to a recorded
driveway easement shall be established from the inner edge of the driveway
easement and calculated the same as a side yard setback.
Any deviations from these setback requirements must be approved at time of pre-
conference meeting and may require a variance to accomplish.
BUILDING LINE VARIATIONS. The Council or designee may establish a building line
or setback along certain streets or property other than the line established by
the yard requirements specifically provided in this chapter when it is found
that to do so will protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Such
building line or setback shall be identified on a plan and, if adopted, shall
be placed on the official zoning maps.
LOT DEPTH: The horizontal length of a straight line drawn from the midpoint of
the lot front line and at right angles to such line to its intersection with a
line parallel to the lot front line and passing through the midpoint of the lot
rear line. In the case of a lot having a curved front line, the lot front line
for purposes of this section shall be deemed to be a line tangent to the curve
and parallel to a straight line connecting the points of intersection of the
lot side lines with the curved lot front line.
LOT FRONTAGE (FRONTAGE): The length of that portion of a lot abutting the
public (private) street providing principal access to the lot.
LOT LINES:
1.   Lot Front Lines - A line separating the lot from the street, or public
right-of-way other than an alley if a street does not exist. In the case of a
corner lot, the shortest continuous line separating the lot from the street or
public right-of-way shall be the lot front line. In case of corner lots having
equal lines abutting a street or public right-of-way, that property line which
when extended creates the front property line for the greatest number of
interior lots in the same block shall be considered as the lot front line of
such corner lot. Where a lot does not abut a public right-of-way or street the
lot front line shall be the lot line nearest to a street or public right-of-
way.
2.   Lot Rear Line - A lot line which is opposite and most distant from the lot
front line. For the purposes of establishing the lot rear line the following
shall apply:

is parallel to the lot front line, such rear boundary is the lot rear line.
   b.   In the case of a lot, the rear boundary of which is formed by two or
more lines, the lot rear line shall be a line ten feet in length within the lot
and farthest removed from the lot front line and at right angles to the line
comprising the depth of such a lot.
   c.   In the case of a trapezoidal lot, the rear line of which is not
parallel to the lot front line, the lot rear line shall be deemed to be a line
at right angles to the line comprising the depth of such lot and drawn through
a point bisecting the recorded lot rear line.
   d.   In no case shall the application of the above be interpreted as
permitting a main building to locate closer than eight feet to any property
line.
3.   Lot Side Line - Any lot boundary line not a lot front line or a lot rear
line.
LOT OF RECORD - An area of land designated as a residential lot on the plat or
subdivision recorded or registered, pursuant to statute, with Pendleton County.
