of the improvement. The lien takes precedence over all other liens, whether
created prior to or subsequent to the publication of the ordinance, except a

detention, or search which is solely motivated by consideration of an
individual’s actual or perceived race, color, or ethnicity, or making
discretionary decisions during the execution of law enforcement duties based on
the above stated considerations. Nothing shall preclude an officer from

parties who shall be jointly and severally responsible for payment.
   (C)   The Fire Department Board and the City Council may make rules or

Department services shall be deposited for use within the Police Department
budget and as allocated by the City Council for expenses which may include but
not be limited to equipment purchases, overtime funding, programs, supplies

information will be sent to Cost Recovery Corporation for billing and
collection with all sums collected to be made payable to the Eminence Fire
Department.

prior to billing. The Eminence Police Department shall prepare an incident
report form for vehicular accidents/collisions which fall under the purview of
this section. Said report shall be submitted to Cost Recovery Corporation (CRC)
and shall contain information to identify the parties involved in the vehicular
accidents/collision, the “at fault” party, as well as information to identify
the party as a resident or non-resident of the city. Said report shall be
utilized by CRC for billing and collection, consistent with this section, with

officer or department having charge of such matters from time to time, and
shall be made only according to such specifications and in such manner as may
from time to time be prescribed. No new water or sewer connections shall be
made to the water or sewer system unless the property to which said connection
is being made is located or annexed into the city limits of the city.
   (B)   A tap-on connection fee shall be paid to the city prior to affecting
any new water connection, the same being hereby fixed at $1,800 for 3/4-inch
pipe for each new connection to water. Any other size pipe connection shall be

   (C)   A tap-on connection fee shall be paid to the city prior to affecting
any new sewer connection, same being hereby fixed as follows:
      (1)   Residential structures. One thousand dollars for a single or multi-
family residential structure. Provided, however, where a connection is being
made to a designated tap readily available which does not require the city to
physically make the tap, no tap-on fee shall be required. Where a reconnection
is being made after destruction or demolition of a previously existing
residential structure, no additional tap-on fee shall be required if the
following prerequisites are met:
         (a)   A tap-on fee was previously paid; and
         (b)   The tap-on access point can be located and is acceptable and
operational.
      (2)   No sewer impact or connection fee shall be required if the owner of
a residential property can establish that there is an existing septic system
and that a sewer use fee has been paid on said property for at least a six-
month period.
      (3)   Commercial structures containing no more than five offices or
retail establishments or some combination thereof shall require payment of a
$1,000 tap-on fee. Should there be an excess of five offices or retail
establishments or some combination thereof then the tap-on fee shall be $1,750.

   (D)   Installations of water line and/or sewer line from the main to the
property line of a property owner shall be made by the city upon receipt of all
required fees and said property owner shall be responsible for the securing of
any easement or easements necessary. Provided, however, such installations by
the city shall be made only where sewer service and/or water service is deemed
to be “available” as defined in §
51.22.
   (E)   All installations, maintenance and repairs from the property line to
the property shall be made by the property owner, at the property owner’s
expense, but subject to inspections above set forth. No new water and/or sewer
connection shall be made for any user (individual, business or land developer)
unless the property for which service is requested is within the corporate
limits of the city.
   (F)   In addition to the foregoing water and sewer connection fees there is
hereby further imposed as impact fee (capacity charge). The funds collected
pursuant to this division shall be allocated to a reserve account which shall
be maintained to repair, enhance and/or increase the capacity of infrastructure
of the water and sewer system as needed. Said impact fee shall be paid prior to
making water or sewer connection. Said impact fee is established as follows:
      (1)   Prior to making any waterline connection for residential or
commercial purposes, an impact fee shall be paid in the amount of $750 per unit
and prior to making any sewer line connection for residential or commercial
purposes an impact fee of $2,000 per unit shall be paid. UNIT shall be defined
as a separate residential area intended for occupancy by an individual or
family group within a multiple dwelling structure (example: apartment) and/or a
separate commercial area intended for occupancy as an office, business or other
commercial venture within a compartmented structure. Provided, however, where
there is reconnection after a demolition or destruction of a previously
existing structure, there shall be no impact fee if the previous structure was
a single-family residential structure and the replacement structure is a
single-family residential structure, if the impact fee was previously paid and
if the prior tap can be located and is acceptable and operational. However,
should there be a replacement of a single-family structure with a multi-family
structure then there shall be an impact fee for each unit in addition to the
number of units which existed prior to said demolition or destruction.
      (2)   Prior to making any water or sewer connection for industrial
purposes there shall be paid impact fees as follows:
         (a)   Prior to making any water line connection, a water impact fee of
$100 per 1,000 gallons of anticipated use per month. For all industrial users
there shall be a minimum impact fee for water line connection of $500. No sewer
impact or connection fee shall be required if the owner can establish that
there is an existing septic system and that a sewer use fee has been paid for
at least a six-month period.
         (b)   Prior to making any sewer line connection an impact fee of $400
per 1,000 gallons of anticipated use per month. For all industrial users there
shall be a minimum impact fee for sewer line connection of $2,000.
      (3)   Further, there shall be an audit conducted to determine the average
of the seventh through twelfth month after connection and based upon said
average an adjustment shall be made to either increase or decrease the impact
fee based upon actual use rather than anticipated usage for both water and
sewage usage.
      (4)   Industrial users for purposes of this section shall be defined as:
(a) all users subject to categorical pre-treatment standards under 40 CFR403.6
and 40 CFR Chapter I, subchapter N; and (b) any non-categorical user that (i)
discharges 25,000 gallons per day or more processed waste water (“processed
waste water” excludes sanitary non-contact cooling, and boiler blow down waste
waters) or (ii) contributes a process waste stream which makes up to 5% or more
of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic (BOD, TSS, etc.) capacity of
the treatment plant; or (iii) has a reasonable potential, in the opinion of the
control or approval authority, to adversely affect the pollutants, sludge
contamination or endangerment of POT workers.

§ 51.10 CONNECTION FEE AND DEPOSIT FOR SERVICES.
   Each customer shall pay a $25 connection fee before service is begun. In
addition each customer shall pay a $100 deposit. This deposit shall be held to
secure further payments as required. Said deposit shall be applied to
outstanding balances in case of default or shall be refunded, if unapplied,
upon voluntary termination of service by the customer. Should there be an
existing deposit held by the Eminence Water Works which has been unapplied to a
delinquent bill and said deposit remaining is in an amount less than the full
$100, then a customer seeking to restore the connection shall be required to
pay such sum as is necessary to bring that existing deposit up to $100. No
connection fee or deposit shall be required of any non-profit, religious
(church or parsonage) or governmental entity.

of industrial establishment users, the total cost of operation and maintenance
of the sewage works, debt service obligations, and the sewer service charges,
including the annual percentage increase for increased operations cost. Based
upon such review, the city shall revise, when necessary the schedule of sewer
service charges for industrial establishment users to accomplish the following:
      (1)   Excessive strength and toxicity surcharges shall be reviewed at the
time of and in conjunction with the review of user charges. Surcharge rates
shall be revised when necessary to reflect current treatment and monitoring
costs.
      (2)   Maintain an equitable distribution of operations and maintenance

§ 51.16 ADJUSTMENTS TO WATER OR SEWER BILLS.
   (A)   Adjustments to water or sewer bills of customers of the city may be
made in the discretion of the City Council or by the Mayor and City Clerk of
said city acting under specific criteria established by said City Council upon
request made where the said body or Mayor and City Clerk has reason to believe
that an unusually high water or sewer bill is the result of an accident, a line
break, a non-sewered use of water or some cause other than water use. However,
no water or sewer adjustment will be given for the purpose of water of grass or
flowers, or any other actual use of water and sewer services. Sewer charges
shall apply to all uses of water regardless of whether said use of water goes
into the sewer system or not. If an adjustment is given to a customer with both
water and sewer services, said adjustment shall be on both water and sewer
charges based upon criteria established by City Council. However, no sewer
charge shall be assessed for water utilized to fill a swimming pool provided
that the customer gives written notice to the City Clerk’s office not less than
45 business days after the time the pool was filled. This provision shall be
available to a customer in addition to authorized adjustments related to an
accident, line break or non-sewage use as described above. Said swimming pool
exemption shall be limited to one pool per calendar year and shall apply only
to pools in excess of 4,000 gallons capacity.
   (B)   Only one adjustment shall be made per calendar year per water meter.
   (C)   There shall be no water or sewer adjustment where there is reason to
believe that the customer was aware of and ignored a problem situation which
resulted in such excessive water or sewer bills.

§ 51.17 EXPIRATION OF AUTHORIZATION FOR SEWER HOOK-UP.
   Any authorization for a hook-up to the sewers of the city shall expire and
be void if not exercised by making an actual hook-up to said sewer within 180
days following said authorization and payment of fee for hook-up. Any fee paid
for a hook-up not so exercised within the prescribed period shall not be
refunded and shall not be forfeited to the city, except upon petition made by
the person holding said authorization prior to said expiration, the City
Council may grant extensions of time for making such hook-up for such periods
as the City Council in its sole discretion deems appropriate.

§ 51.18 WATER AND SEWER MAIN EXTENSION.
   No additional water or sewer main or extensions to existing water or sewer
main of the city shall be made except on approval of the City Council and paid
for as follows, to wit:
      (A)   Where additional water and/or sewer main or extensions to existing
water or sewer main is requested by a subdivider or developer, the entire costs
of labor and materials for such extension or addition to the water and/or sewer
main shall be paid by the developer/sub divider. Should developer provide the
materials and labor and install said water and/or sewer main extensions to the
existing water or sewer main themselves, said developer or sub divider shall
install same to the specifications of the Eminence Water Works. The city Public
Works Director, under the authority of the City Council, shall make the
criteria determination per project. All additions or extensions to the existing
water or sewer mains shall include the necessary lift stations as deemed
appropriate by the Public Works Director. No individual sewer grinder pumps
will be accepted by the city Water Works for maintenance unless specifically
authorized by the City Council.
      (B)   Provided, however, the city shall only be obligated to install such
sewer and/or water main if the property for which service is requested is
directly adjacent to an existing city sewer main/water main or is adjacent to a
city easement which is adjacent to such sewer main/water main and only when
such easement can reasonably be crossed.
      (C)   Where an addition or extension to the water and/or sewer main is
requested by an individual or business for the personal use of the said
individual or business then said individual, or business shall pay the entire
cost of materials necessary for such extension or addition and the city shall
pay the cost of labor necessary therefore. Land developers shall be responsible
for providing all materials and labor for any such addition or extension.
However, where an individual or business pays the costs of such materials and/
or labor such individual or business shall be entitled to reimbursement from
any customer thereafter hooking onto the main for which said individual or
business had paid for the materials and said reimbursement shall be calculated
by the following formula:
Number of running feet traversed by main and         Amount of reimbursement
owned by person wishing to tap into line         X
___________________________________________________________________________________
Total number of feet of main added            Total initial costs of person
entitled to
initially by person entitled to reimbursement         reimbursement
   (D)   The right to reimbursement from additional persons wishing to add onto
such line shall exist for a period of ten years after which an individual and/
or business may connect onto the addition or extension of the main without
reimbursement to the original individual and/or business which paid for the
material therefore. Any individual or other business or individual entity shall
be responsible for obtaining any and all easements, rights-of-way or other
authorizations necessary to allow any extension of water and/or sewer main
requested by such person or entity.
   (E)   Said water and sewer main extension reimbursement policy shall not
apply to developers and/or sub dividers unless the persons wishing to add onto
such line are another developer and/or subdivider.
   (F)   Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the City Council from
exercising its discretion to extend water and/or sewer mains at city expense to
any location it deems in the best interest of the city.
(Ord. 2015-007, passed 11-9-15)
§ 51.19 DEFINITION OF INSTALLATION.
   The term INSTALLATION as used in this and all ordinances of the city
regarding sewer lines, water and water lines shall be interpreted by the City
Council to encompass and include in its meaning, maintenance of said sewers,
and sewer mains, to the property line or service connection and water, and
water lines to city meter except as is specifically contradicted in any such
ordinance. SEWER MAIN shall mean sewer line located between manholes and
SERVICE LINE shall mean any branch off the sewer main.

of his/her/it’s property by another (tenant) with or without paying rent shall
be responsible to the city for any water, sewer or trash bills due to said city
defaulted upon by said tenant. Prior to connection being made or water/sewer/
trash service being commenced for any such tenant, the landlord or land owner
shall sign an acknowledgment of th is responsibility and provide to the City
Clerk with address where he/she/it may be contracted. Prior to commencing
service to any customer, the City Clerk shall inquire of the person requesting
service whether he/she/it is the property owner or a person occupying property
of another tenant. If the person requesting service is a tenant, the owner’s

§ 51.42 DESIGN AND INSTALLATION.
   (A)    A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway. The sewer
from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any
obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such
single connection aforementioned.
   (B)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent, to meet all
requirements of this chapter. Permit and inspection fees for new buildings
using existing building sewers shall be the same as for new building sewers. If
additional sewer customers are added to the old building sewers, additional
sewer tap fees shall be charged accordingly even though no new sewer tap is
actually made into the city system.
   (C)   Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customer's
side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than that of the
customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be permitted.
   (D)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM A-74, latest
revision, PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) sewer pipe, ASTM D-3034, latest revision, or
ductile iron pipe, AWWA specification C-151 cement lined, and shall meet all
requirements of the State plumbing code. Joints shall be as set out
hereinafter. Any part of the building sewer that is located within five feet of
a water service pipe shall be constructed with cast iron soil pipe or ductile
iron pipe, unless the building sewer is at least one foot deeper in the ground
than the water service line. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe may be
required by the city where the building sewer is exposed to damage or stoppage
by tree roots. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe shall be used in filled
or unstable ground, in areas where the cover over the building sewer is less
than three feet, or in areas where the sewer is subject to vehicular or other
external loads.
   (E)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the local and state building and plumbing codes and other applicable rules and
regulations of the city. Manholes may be required at all commercial and
industrial connections to the Eminence municipal sewer system. The owner of the
facility shall be responsible for all costs associated with installation of the
manhole(s). Specifications for manholes may be obtained by contacting the
Public Works Director.
   (F)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall
indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. Fees for connection shall
be as established by the city.
   (G)   The owner shall ensure that all excavations for building sewer
installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the city.
   (H)   In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the same building sewer.
Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary drainage shall be above
basement floor or in separately watertight or drained sump or channel.
   (I)   The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the
easement or property line. Where no property located service branch is
available, an authorized agent of the city shall cut a neat hole into the main
line of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle installed to receive
the building sewer. The invert of the building sewer at such point of
connection with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant of the main line of the
public sewer. A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner
surface of the public sewer, shall be made and the saddle made secure and
watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A
wye and H bend fitting shall be installed at the property line between the
public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a
cleanout and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After
testing, a cast iron or ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and
brought flush with the ground surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type
joint applicable to the pipe used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion
of ground or surface water.
   (J)   All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet or
exceed the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code.

for residential and (2) for service to commercial and industrial
establishments. In either case, the owner(s) or his agent shall make
application on a special form furnished by the city. Applicants for service to
commercial and industrial establishments shall be required to furnish
information about all waste producing activities, wastewater characteristics
and constituents. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of
the Superintendent. Details regarding commercial and industrial permits
include, but are not limited to those required by this chapter. Permit and
inspection fees shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed.
   (B)   Users shall promptly notify the city in advance of any introduction of
wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character of
the wastewater constituents being introduced into the POTW. The Superintendent
may deny or place conditions on the new introduction or change in discharge
based on the information submitted in the notification or additional
information as may be requested. Significant Industrial Users are required to
notify the Superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting
the potential for a slug discharge.
   (C)   No person(s) shall uncover, plug or make any connection with or
opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining permission from the Superintendent.

turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. Any such
connections which already exist on the effective date of this chapter shall be
completely and permanently disconnected within sixty (60) days of the effective
date of this chapter. The owner(s) of any building sewers having such
connections, leaks or defects shall bear all costs incidental to removal of
such sources. Pipes, sumps, and pumps for such sources of ground and surface
water shall be separate from wastewater facilities. Removal of such sources of
water without presence of separate facilities shall be evidence of drainage to
public sanitary sewer.
   (B)   All building sewers shall be smoke tested through the wye branch at
the public sewer connection, with public sewer tightly plugged off, after
connections at both ends are made and after all pipe is properly bedded and
backfilled at least to top of pipe and if backfill is completed, within two (2)
weeks after completion of backfill. At time of test, any openings into the
building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any
leakage of smoke from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be
located at test and repaired to stand repetition of smoke test without leakage.
When smoke testing is completed, the temporary flow line plug shall be removed
and a permanent watertight plug shall be placed in branch of test wye-branch
and carefully backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six (6) inches above
the top of the branch.

§ 51.67 COMPLIANCE DATA REPORTING.
   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards or, in the case of a new user,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards and Requirements
shall submit, to the Superintendent, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process
which are limited by Categorical Pretreatment Standards and Requirements and
the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's
facility which are limited by such Categorical Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable Categorical
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional pretreatment and time schedule is necessary to bring
the user into compliance with the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards
or Requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the user. Where compliance schedules are required, the following conditions
shall apply:
   (A)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable Pretreatment Standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
   (B)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
   (C)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Public Works Director
no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule.
(Ord. 92-015, passed 12-14-92; Am. Ord. 2012-001, passed 1-9-12)
§ 51.68 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   All significant industrial users shall submit, to the Public Works
Director, every six (6) months (on dates specified in the Industrial User
Permit) unless required more frequently by the Permit, a report indicating, at
a minimum, the nature and concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which
are limited by such Pretreatment Standards or discharge permit. The report
shall also include the chain-of-custody (COC) forms, field data and any other
information required by the Public Works Director. In cases where the User is
required to comply with a Best Management Practice, the User must submit
documentation required by the Public Works Director as deemed necessary to
determine the compliance status of the User. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all daily flows or the average daily flow. At the
discretion of the Public Works Director and in consideration of such factors as
local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Public Works
Director may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be
submitted. All periodic Compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.12 and Division VI, §
51.76 of this chapter. The city may authorize an Industrial User subject to a
categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the Industrial User. This authorization is subject to the
conditions as given in 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2).
   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the User's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge. All analyses shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to
the city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures
established by the U.S. EPA Administrator pursuant to Section 304 (g) of the
Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto and 40 CFR 261 or
with any other test procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator. Except
as indicated in subsection (A) and (B) below, the User must collect wastewater
samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the Superintendent, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the composting
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
Superintendent, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to
show compliance with instantaneous limits, (1) Samples for oil and grease,
temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides and volatile organic
compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques, (2) For sampling
required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports
required in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must
be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by 40
CFR 403.12(6) and (h), the Industrial User is required to collect the number of
grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
   (C)   Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant(s) in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication.
"Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants," April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
   (D)   A Baseline Monitoring Report (BMR) must be submitted to the Public
Works Director by all categorical industrial users at least ninety (90) days
prior to initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. Submittal of the Permit
Application required by the city shall also satisfy this requirement. The BMR
or Permit Application must contain, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Production data: a process description, SIC code number, raw
materials used, chemicals used, final product, pretreatment industrial category
(if applicable), and a schematic which indicates points of discharge to the
sewer system.
      (2)   Identifying information to include name, address of facility, owner
(s), contact person and any other permits held by the facility.
      (3)   Wastewater characteristics: total plant flow, types of discharges,
average and maximum flows from each process.
      (4)   Nature/concentration of pollutants: analytical results for all
pollutants regulated by this chapter and/or any applicable federal pretreatment
standard and sample type and location. All analyses must conform with 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto.
      (5)   Information concerning any pretreatment equipment used to treat the
facility's discharge.
      (6)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the User's
authorized representative as defined in §
51.26 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the Pretreatment Standards, the shortest schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable Pretreatment
Standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in §
51.67.
   (E)   New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in
subsections (C) and (D) above, but at no time shall a new source commence
discharge(s) to the public sewer of substances that do not meet provisions of
this chapter. All new sources must be in compliance with all provisions of this
chapter, state and federal pretreatment regulations prior to commencement of
discharge to the public sewer.
   (F)   Compliance schedule progress reports.
      (1)   The following conditions shall apply to all compliance schedules
required by this chapter:
         (a)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the User to
meet the applicable Pretreatment Standards.
         (b)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
      (2)   The User shall submit a progress report to the Public Works
Director no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule
and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the User to return to the established
schedule; and in no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Public Works Director.
   (G)   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements and
documentation associated with Best Management Practices as may be required.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for
a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall automatically be
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User or the city or
where the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention by the
Public Works Director.

§ 51.70 MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   The city shall require significant industrial users to provide
and operate, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or
internal drainage system. The monitoring facility should normally be situated
on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in a public right-of-way. The Superintendent shall review and
approve the location, plans, and specifications for such monitoring facilities
and may require them to be constructed to provide for the separate monitoring
and sampling of industrial waste and sanitary sewage flows.
      (2)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility shall be designed and maintained in a manner such that the safety
of city and industrial personnel shall be foremost. The facility, sampling, and
measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a proper operating
condition at the expense of the user.
      (3)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days
following approval of the location, plans and specifications.
   (B)   All sampling analyses done in accordance with approved federal EPA
procedures by the industrial user during a reporting period shall be submitted
to the Superintendent regardless of whether or not that analysis was required
by the industrial user's discharge permit.
   (C)   The industrial user must receive the approval of the Superintendent
before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring facilities to be used in
all required sampling.
(Ord. 92-015, passed 12-14-92; Am. Ord. 2012-001, passed 1-9-12)
§ 51.71 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether
the purposes of this chapter are being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the Superintendent or his representative ready access at
all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, copying records, records examination or in the
performance of any of their duties.
   (B)   The city, Approval Authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, Approval Authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.

treatment as required to comply with this chapter and achieve compliance with
any applicable Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time
limitations as specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. The city may
require the development of a compliance schedule for installation of
pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any industrial user that cannot
meet discharge limits required by this chapter. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level required by this chapter shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an effluent that complies with the provisions
of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to
the user's initiation of the changes.

Enforcement
§ 51.95 GENERAL.
   (A)   The city, through the Superintendent or his designee, to insure
compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40 CFR Subchapter N, and
401 KAR 5:055, may take the following enforcement steps against users in non-
compliance with the chapter. The remedies available to the POTW include
injunctive relief, civil and criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of
discharges and/or water service and the publishing of the list of significant
violators annually. The enforcement authority shall be vested in the
Superintendent or their designee.
   (B)   The Superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or
an Industrial User Permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of
the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the POTW
to violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES Permit.
   (C)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the Industrial User Permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall
reinstate the Industrial User Permit and/or the wastewater treatment service
upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed
written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be
submitted to the city within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence.
(Ord. 92-015, passed 12-14-92; Am. Ord. 2012-001, passed 1-9-12)
§ 51.96 ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
   (A)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   Any user found to be violating any provisions of this chapter,
wastewater permit, or any order issued hereunder, shall be served by the city
with written notice stating the nature of the violation(s). Within ten (10)
days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted to the Superintendent. Submission
of this plan in no way relieves the user of potential liability for any
violation occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation.
      (2)   If the violations persist or the explanation and/ or plan are not
adequate, the city's response shall be more formal and commitments (or
schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in an enforceable
document. The enforcement response selected will be related to the seriousness
of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if compliance is not
achieved expeditiously after the initial action. A significant non-compliance
as defined in §
51.74, will require a formal enforcement action.
      (3)   The full scale of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the
Enforcement Response Plan.
   (B)   Administrative orders. Any user who after receiving a Notice of
Violation shall continue to discharge in violation of this chapter or other
pretreatment standards or requirements or is determined to be a chronic or
persistent violator or who is determined to be a significant violator, shall be
ordered to appear before the city. At said appearance, a compliance schedule
will be given to the non-conforming user and an administrative fine assessed.
The fine shall be determined on a case-by-case basis which shall consider the
type and severity of violations, duration of violation, number of violations,
severity of impact on the POTW, impact on human health, users economic benefit
from violation, history of violations, good faith of the user, and shall be a
non-arbitrary but appropriate amount. The administrative order may take any of
the following three forms:
      (1)   Consent Orders. The Superintendent or their designee is hereby
empowered to enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user
responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to
be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period also specified by the order. Consent Orders shall have the same force
and effect as orders issued pursuant to subsection (B)(3) below.
      (2)   Compliance Orders. When the Superintendent or their designee finds
that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the chapter or a
permit or order issued hereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user
responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are
properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be
reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including
the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and
management practices.
      (3)   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit
or order issued hereunder, the Superintendent may issue an order to cease and
desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to: (a)
comply forthwith, or (b) take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and terminating the discharge.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The Superintendent or their designee may issue to any user who
causes or contributes to violations of this chapter, wastewater permit or order
issued hereunder, an order to appear and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Superintendent
regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the
proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause, before the
Superintendent, why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent or officer of the industrial user. Whether or
not a duly notified industrial user or its representative appears, immediate
enforcement action may be pursued.
      (2)   The city may, itself, conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or
designate a representative to:
         (a)   Issue, in the name of the city, notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in such hearing;
         (b)   Take the evidence;
         (c)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city for
action thereon.
      (3)   At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony may be
taken under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded,
will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing
upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
      (4)   After the city has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified
time period, the sewer service will be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly operated.
Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
   (D)   Additional enforcement remedies.
      (1)   Performance bonds. The Superintendent may decline to reissue a
permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of
this chapter or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such user
first files with it a satisfactory bond, payable to the POTW, in a sum not to
exceed a value determined by the superintendent to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
      (2)   Liability insurance. The Superintendent may decline to reissue a
permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of
this chapter or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless the
industrial user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge.
   (E)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The Public Works Director may take any, all, or combination of
these actions against a noncompliant User. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the city's Enforcement Response
Plan. However, the Public Works Director may take other action against any User
when the circumstances warrant. Further the Public Works Director is empowered
to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant User.

CROSS-CONNECTION PREVENTION PROGRAM
§ 51.110 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this resolution to establish a program to assure
that the public water supply is protected from any auxiliary water supply which
may cause contamination due to backflow or cross connections. The city
recognizes that contamination of the public water supply presents and imminent
health hazard to the residential and non-residential water users and the
potential liability to The city.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this resolution to meet the requirements
of 401 KAR 8:020 as enacted by the Kentucky Natural Resource and Environmental
Protection Cabinet.
(Res. 2012-005, passed 11-12-12)
§ 51.111 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this resolution, unless the context clearly requires a different
meaning:
   (A)   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water supply on or available to the
premises other than the city’s public water supply. These auxiliary waters may
include water from any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream, or
body of water or any water or other substance of unknown or questionable
quality that may present a health or system hazard to the potable public water
supply.
   (B)   BACKFLOW. The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either
back pressure or back siphonage.
   (C)   BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An assembly or means designed to prevent
backflow. A listing of acceptable backflow prevention assemblies and degree of
hazard is available in the Kentucky State Plumbing Law, regulations and Code.
   (D)   CONTAMINATION. An impairment of the quality of the potable water
supply by any waste product, fluid, substance, compound or other material to a
degree which creates and actual or potential hazard to the public health
through poisoning or through the spread of disease.
   (E)   CROSS CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems one of which contains
potable water and the other non-potable water or substance of questionable
quality, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur into the
potable water system.
   (F)   THERMAL EXPANSION TANK. A device installed on the cold water supply
line near a water heater to compensate for the expansion of water within a
water system when such water is heated.
(Res. 2012-005, passed 11-12-12)
§ 51.112 REQUIREMENTS.
   The city shall provide protection to the public water system against
backflow by implementing the following requirements.
   (A)   Residential. Buildings used for habitation or occupancy shall be
considered as residential buildings. No new water service connection to any
premises shall be installed or allowed to be installed by the city unless such
service connection is protected by a backflow prevention assembly. Residential
service connections shall be considered as low hazard applications and all such
connections shall have at a minimum a dual check valve backflow preventer
installed between the water meter and the residence. The city may require
additional or alternate backflow prevention assemblies if the degree of hazard
constitutes a higher level of protection for the public water system.
   (B)   Non-Residential. No new water service connection to any non-
residential facility shall be installed or allowed to be installed by the city
unless such water service connection is protected by a backflow prevention
assembly. The type of protective device required shall be determined at the
time of installation of the service connection and shall be commensurate with
the degree of hazard at the point of such service connection. At a minimum the
service connection shall be installed with a dual check valve backflow
preventer. In the event activities to occur within a non-residential facility
change and creates a higher degree of hazard, then the backflow prevention
assembly shall be replaced with an assembly which provides acceptable
protection.
   (C)   Inspections. The customer's water system shall be open for inspection
at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to determine
whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including
violation of this resolution, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the
city may deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a
physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the
condition in conformance with the state and local statutes relating to
plumbing, water supplies, and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. Water
service to any premises shall be discontinued if it is found that a backflow
prevention assembly required by this resolution has been removed, bypassed, or
if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be
restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
   (D)   Existing service connections. All existing water service connections
which do not have backflow prevention assemblies or existing water service
connections which have less than the minimum required backflow prevention
assemblies, shall, except for the inspection requirements, be excluded from the
requirements of this resolution so long as the city is assured that the public
water system is satisfactorily protected. However, if the city determines that
a hazard to health exists, then a backflow prevention assembly meeting the
requirements of this resolution may be installed on such existing service
connection. Backflow prevention assemblies shall not be installed on existing
service connections until after the property owner of such residential or
commercial property has been informed of the actual and potential hazards that
may be created as a result of such backflow assembly installation. Notices
provided to such property owners shall include the following language as
adopted in 815 KAR 20:120 Section 2. Item (6): When the cross connection
control devices are properly installed, they create a closed water system. A
properly sized thermal expansion tank shall be installed in the cold water
supply located as near the water heater as possible.

follows:
   (A)   Green alone or “Go”: Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed

either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or “Caution” when shown following the green or
“Go” signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned

clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or “Stop”: Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain
standing until green or “Go” is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop

surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,

tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of

   (A)   Except as provided in division (D), net profit shall be apportioned as
follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the

section, plus the sales factor, described in subsection (3) of this section,
and the denominator of which is two (2); and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C).
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (A) thru (D), the business entity
shall file an apportionment form provided by the occupational tax office.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual’s
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sales, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than

         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenue from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income- producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will
fairly represent the business entity’s business activity in the city; or

city in accordance with §
110.03.
   (B)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter ending
thereafter, on or before the end of the month following the close of each
quarter, make a return and report to the city, and pay to the city, the tax

required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the city.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any sums
required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to be
withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational

withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor the cessation of holding
any corporate office, shall discharge that liability of any person; provided
that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each or every person
holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became obligated.

divisions (G) and (H) of this section. In all cases where the employer does not
withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the employee, such employee or
employees shall be responsible for filing with the city each quarter in the
same manner as if they were the employer. If an employer fails to or is not
required to withhold, report, or pay the license fee it shall become the duty
of the employee to file with the city. The only employer that is not required
to withhold, report, and pay the occupational license tax is the Federal
Government including the United States Postal Service. The payment required to
be made by an employee, can be made quarterly, for the periods ending March

year, giving the amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation
earned during such preceding year by each such employee. This list shall
include all current full time employees, part time employees, temporary
employees, and terminated employees whether it be voluntary or involuntary.

bodies of New Castle, Pleasureville, Campbellsburg, Eminence, and Smithfield

and intensity of land use in order to provide for adequate light and air, and
to maintain the status quo pending completion of the final master or
comprehensive plan for this planning unit.
