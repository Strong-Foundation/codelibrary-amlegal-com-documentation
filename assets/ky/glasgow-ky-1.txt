GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 39.01 TITLE.

Ethics.”

§ 39.02 FINDINGS.
   The legislative body of the city finds and declares that:
   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of the city depends upon
the public’s confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers
and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the private
interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled.
   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards with which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply while
conducting their public duties.
(1989 Code, § 41.02) (Ord. 2085, passed 11-28-1994; Am. Ord. 2882, passed 5-23-
2016; Am. Ord. 2020-2983, passed 3-22-2021)
§ 39.03 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring that
standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for officers
and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in their
application and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
KRS 65.003, as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly, and any
amendments made subsequent to that date.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

home-rule class.
   (C)   In addition to the constitutional and statutory provisions, there are

with another, when there arises an implication that the duties and
responsibilities of both cannot be performed at the same time with a necessary
degree of impartiality and honesty.

failing to act on the matter may personally or financially benefit any of the
persons or entities listed in §

withdrawal occurs at a public meeting, or leave the room if it is a legally
conducted closed meeting (executive session) under KRS 61.810 and KRS 61.815.

withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is in such a situation, he or
she should not accept the position with the city.

requested to withdraw from participation in a matter, for the reason that he or
she has a conflict of interest, by:
      (1)   Another member;
      (2)   A party to the current matter; or
      (3)   Anyone else who may be affected by a decision relating to this
matter;
the member must decide whether to withdraw, and then have this decision noted
on the official record. If the member decides not to withdraw, the challenging
member(s) may file a complaint with the Ethics Board.

within ten working days from the date of its receipt. Within ten working days,
the Board shall forward to each officer or employee of the city or city agency
who is the subject of the complaint, a copy of the complaint and a general
statement of the applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The Ethics Board may, on its own initiative, determine through an
inquiry into informal allegations or information provided directly to the
Board, by referral, in the public news media or otherwise, that a violation of
this code may exist and prepare a complaint of its own. The Ethics Board may
also amend a complaint that has been filed with it by adding further
allegations, by adding respondents involved in the same conduct, directly or
indirectly, by action or inaction, or by deleting allegations that would not
constitute a violation of this code, have been made against persons or entities
not covered by this code, or do not appear to be supported by the facts. The
Ethics Board may also consolidate complaints where the allegations are
materially related. The Ethics Board must send amended complaints to the
complainant and respondent.
   (C)   Within 30 days of the receipt of a proper complaint, the Ethics Board
shall conduct a preliminary inquiry concerning the allegations contained in the
complaint. The Board shall afford a person who is the subject of the complaint
an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the complaint. The person shall
have the right to be represented by counsel, to appear and be heard under oath,
and to offer evidence in response to the allegations.
   (D)   The person who is the subject of the complaint (respondent) may file
with the Ethics Board a response to the complaint within 30 days after his or
her receipt of the complaint. The response, if any, must be sent to the person
filing the original complaint (complainant) by the Ethics Board within five
days after its filing. Within 15 days after receipt, the complainant may also
file with the Ethics Board a response to the respondent’s response, which the
Ethics Board must send to the respondent within five days after its filing.
   (E)   Extensions of time to any of the time limitations specified in this
section may be granted by the Ethics Board, upon a vote of the majority of the
members. If no meeting can be held before such time limit runs out, the chair

give written notice of any extension(s) of time to the respondent and the
complainant.
   (F)   All proceedings and records relating to a preliminary inquiry being
conducted by the Ethics Board shall be confidential until a final determination
is made by the Board, except:
      (1)   The Board may turn over to the Commonwealth's Attorney or County
Attorney evidence that may be used in criminal proceedings;
      (2)   If the complainant or alleged violator publicly discloses the
existence of a preliminary inquiry, the Board may publicly confirm the
existence of the inquiry, and, at its discretion, make public any documents
issued to either party.
   (G)   The Board shall make a determination, based on its preliminary
inquiry, whether the complaint is within its jurisdiction and, if so, whether
it alleges a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation of this chapter.
If the Board concludes that the complaint is outside of its jurisdiction,
frivolous or without factual basis, the Board shall immediately terminate the
inquiry, reduce its conclusion to writing, and transmit a copy of its decision
to the complainant and to all officers or employees against whom the complaint
was filed.
   (H)   If the Ethics Board concludes, based upon its preliminary inquiry,
that the complaint is within its jurisdiction and contains allegations
sufficient to establish a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation, the
Board shall notify the officer or employee who is the subject of the complaint,
and may initiate a hearing to determine whether there has been a violation.
   (I)   If a complaint is accepted or prepared pursuant to division (A), the
Ethics Board must conduct an investigation. From this point on, the complainant
may not withdraw his or her complaint, although he or she may request that the
Ethics Board make a finding of either no probable cause or no violation.
   (J)   In conducting an investigation, the Ethics Board may administer oaths
or affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, and require the
production of any books or records it deems relevant and material. The Police
Department and all city agencies, bodies, officials and employees are required
to respond fully and truthfully to all inquiries, and to cooperate with all
requests of the Ethics Board or its agents relating to an investigation. It is
a violation of this code for any official or employee to deny access to
information requested by the Ethics Board in the course of an investigation or
a public hearing, except to the extent that such denial is required by federal,
state or local law.
   (K)   Nothing in this section may be construed to permit the Ethics Board to
conduct an investigation of itself or of any of its members or staff. If the
Ethics Board receives a complaint alleging that the Board or any of its members
or staff have violated any provision of this code, or any other law, the Board
must promptly transmit a copy of the complaint to the legislative body.
   (L)   Any person who knowingly files with the Board a false complaint,
alleging a violation of any provision of this chapter by an officer or employee
of the city or any city agency, shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.

      (2)   The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional O & M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into
compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial
user and certified to by a qualified professional.
   (B)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   All categorical industrial users shall submit to the pretreatment
coordinator during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently by a pretreatment standard or the industrial user discharge permit,
a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent
which are limited by the pretreatment standards or the industrial user
discharge permit. At the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles and the like, the pretreatment coordinator may agree to alter the months
during which the above reports are to be submitted.
      (2)   All analyses shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to the
city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures established
by the U.S. EPA pursuant to § 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 C.F.R. Part
136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
U.S. EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
approved by the U.S. EPA.
      (3)   Where 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication
Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA.
      (4)   All industrial users shall retain all pretreatment records for a
minimum of three years, as required by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(o)(2).
   (C)   Baseline monitoring.
      (1)   A baseline monitoring report (BMR) must be submitted to the
pretreatment coordinator by all categorical industrial users at least 90 days
prior to initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. The BMR must contain,
at a minimum, the following:
         (a)   Production data including a process description, SIC code
number, raw materials used, chemicals used, and final product(s) produced;
         (b)   Name of facility contact person;
         (c)   Wastewater characteristics such as total plant flow, types of
discharges, average and maximum flows from each process;
         (d)   Nature and concentration of pollutants discharged by the public
sewer system that are regulated by this chapter, state and/or federal
pretreatment standards and sample type and location; and
         (e)   Information concerning any pretreatment equipment used to treat
the facility’s discharge.
      (2)   All new sources of industrial discharge must be in compliance with
all provisions of this chapter prior to commencement of discharge.

industrial users must notify the pretreatment coordinator within 24 hours of
first becoming aware of a permit violation. This notification shall include the
date of the violation, the parameter violated and the amount in exceedance.
Within 30 days of first becoming aware of a permit violation, the significant
industrial user must resample for the parameter violated and submit this sample
analysis to the pretreatment coordinator, unless the pretreatment coordinator.
Resampling by the industrial user is not required if GWSC performs sampling at
the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the GWSC performs sampling at
the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time
when the user or the GWSC receives the results of this sampling, unless the
pretreatment coordinator, on behalf of the city, conducts monitoring of this
parameter within that 30-day period.
(1989 Code, § 52.073) (Ord. 1619, passed - -1984; Am. Ord. 1948, passed 3-9-
1992; Am. Ord. 2647, passed 1-26-2009; Am. Ord. 2752, passed 7-25-2011)
§ 51.088 MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The city shall require significant industrial users to provide and
operate, at the user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
system. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s
premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in a public
right-of-way. The pretreatment coordinator shall review and approve the
location plans and specifications for the monitoring facilities and may require
them to be constructed to provide for the separate monitoring and sampling of
industrial waste and sanitary sewage flows. There shall be ample room in or
near the sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis. The facility and sampling and measuring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the user.
   (B)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
approval of the location plans and specifications.
   (C)   All sampling analyses done in accordance with approved U.S. EPA
procedures by the significant industrial user during a reporting period shall
be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator regardless of whether or not that
analysis was required by the user's discharge permit.
   (D)   The significant industrial user must receive the approval of the
pretreatment coordinator before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring
facilities to be used in all required sampling.
   (E)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (1)   The user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the pretreatment coordinator. Where
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
GWSC, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols
(including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field, for volative organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited
in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by GWSC, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required
to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four
grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the pretreatment coordinator may authorize a lower
minimum. For the reports required, the industrial user is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
(1989 Code, § 52.074) (Ord. 1619, passed - -1984; Am. Ord. 1948, passed 3-9-
1992; Am. Ord. 2752, passed 7-25-2011)
§ 51.089 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The pretreatment coordinator shall inspect the facilities of any user to
ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements
are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access
at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of
inspection, sampling, copying and examination of records or in the performance
of their duties. “Reasonable times” shall include any time during which the
user is discharging to the public sewer system and/or operating any
manufacturing process. The city, approval authority and U.S. EPA shall have the
right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspections, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where
a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification
and clearance before entry onto their premises, the user shall make the
necessary arrangements with their security guards so that, upon presentation of
suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and U.S.
EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing
their specific duties.

of pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any significant industrial user
that is not meeting discharge limits established in the user’s industrial user
discharge permit.
      (2)   Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's
expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator before
construction of the facility.
      (3)   The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this
chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the
user’s initiation of the change.
   (B)   (1)   The city is required by federal regulations to keep the public
informed of all cases of significant violations. To accomplish this, the city
shall annually publish in the largest daily newspaper published in the
municipality in which the POTW is located, a list of the users which are in
significant noncompliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at
any time during the previous 12 months.
      (2)   Significant noncompliance is any significant violation that meets
one or more of the following conditions:
         (a)   Results in the exercise of emergency authority by the
pretreatment coordinator;
         (b)   Remains uncorrected 45 days after notice of noncompliance is
given;
         (c)   Involves failure to report noncompliance accurately;
         (d)   It is a chronic of technical review criteria violation:
            1.   Chronic violations: 66% or more of all measurements taken for
the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed, by any
magnitude, a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits as defined in 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(a) and (f)(2)(viii)(A) and
(B);
            2.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations: 33% or more of all
measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal
or exceed the product of numeric pretreatment standard or required including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(a) and (f)(2)(viii)(A)
and (B), multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils
and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
            3.   Any violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(a) and (f)(2)(viii)(A) and (B) (daily maximum,
long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the
pretreatment coordinator determines has caused, alone or in combination with
other discharges, interference or pass-through or has endangered the health of
the POTW personnel or the public;
            4.   Any discharge causing imminent endangerment to human health or
to the environment or resulting in the pretreatment coordinator’s use of his or
her emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
            5.   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, failure to
comply with schedule milestones for starting or completing construction or
attaining final compliance by 90 days or more after the schedule date;
            6.   Failure to provide required reports within 30 days of the due
date;
            7.   A group of violations which the pretreatment coordinator
determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program. The public notification shall also summarize any
enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same 12 months. All
records relating to the pretreatment program of the city shall be made
available to officials of the U.S. EPA or approval authority upon request. All
records shall be maintained for a minimum of three years in accordance with 40
C.F.R. § 403.12(o)(2).

§ 51.149 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.
   The City of Glasgow shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions
of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2727, passed 12-13-2010)
§ 51.150 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this subchapter
are minimum standards; therefore, this subchapter does not intend nor imply
that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution or unauthorized discharge of pollutants or hazardous materials.
(Ord. 2727, passed 12-13-2010)
§ 51.151 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS/EXCEPTIONS.
   Other than naturally-occurring stormwater, no person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged into the MS4 or any conveyance any materials, including
but not limited to, pollutants or hazardous materials or waters containing any
pollutants or hazardous materials that cause or contribute to a violation of
applicable water quality standards. Allowable discharges that create or have
the potential to create unsafe conditions on city streets or other public
rights-of-way are prohibited. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any
illegal discharge to the MS4 or any conveyance is prohibited except that the
following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this
subchapter, if such discharges do not violate applicable water quality
standards:
   (A)   Water line flushing or water from other potable sources, landscape
irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground
water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water,
uncontaminated ground water infiltration, foundation or footing drains, air
conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural
riparian habitat or natural wetland flows, swimming pools if discharged to the
ground, not to a city street or directly to any part of the MS4 or any
conveyance, fire fighting activities, street wash water and any activity
related to normal performance of municipal operations such as street sweeping.

provided that the permit holder is in full compliance with all requirements of
the permit, waiver or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and
provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the MS4 or
any conveyance.
(Ord. 2727, passed 12-13-2010)
§ 51.152 PROHIBITION OF ILLICIT CONNECTIONS.
   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the MS4 or any conveyance is prohibited. This prohibition
expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices
applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to
be in violation of this section if the person connects a line conveying sewage
or any other pollutant or hazardous materials to the MS4 or any conveyance or
allows such a connection to continue.
(Ord. 2727, passed 12-13-2010)
§ 51.153 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS DUE TO ILLICIT DISCHARGES IN EMERGENCY
SITUATIONS.
   The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of persons, to the MS4, or to water of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4, or water of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
(Ord. 2727, passed 12-13-2010)
§ 51.154 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS DUE TO THE DETECTION OF ILLICIT DISCHARGE.
   Any person discharging to the MS4 or any conveyance in violation of this
section may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The city shall require the violator to disconnect
access to the MS4 at their cost or take corrective action to eliminate the
source of the illicit discharge. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this subchapter
without the prior approval of the city.
(Ord. 2727, passed 12-13-2010)
§ 51.155 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
city prior to the allowing of discharges to MS4 or any conveyance. However,
should an illicit discharge be detected from such activities, the city shall
have the authority to regulate the site per the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 2727, passed 12-13-2010)
§ 51.156 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges
associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.
   (A)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this subchapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
that require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the city.
   (B)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying
of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
   (C)   The city shall have the right to install on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement
agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s discharge.
   (D)   The city shall the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
   (F)   Any interference with allowing the city access to a permitted facility
is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this subchapter. A
person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person
denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this subchapter.
   (G)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged and is able to demonstrate probably cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter, or any order issued
hereunder to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, the city may seek all appropriate remedies from any court of
competent jurisdiction, including the issuance of a search warrant.

§ 51.157 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BMPS.
   (A)   The city shall review and approve BMPs for any activity, operation or
facility that may cause or contribute to pollution, discharge of hazardous
materials or has the potential to contaminate naturally occurring stormwater or
waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of these structural and non-structural
BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise which is, or
may be, the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at
such person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent
the further discharge of pollutants or hazardous materials to the MS4 or any
conveyance. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
   (B)   Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a
watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part
of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation and other obstacles that would pollute or contaminate the
watercourse. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes,
or such person’s lessee, shall significantly maintain existing structures
within or adjacent to a watercourse so that such structures will not become a
hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2727, passed 12-13-2010)
§ 51.158 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
or hazardous materials discharging into naturally occurring stormwater, the MS4
or any conveyance, such person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the even of such a
release of hazardous materials, such person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of nonhazardous materials, such person shall notify the
authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone and shall be confirmed by
written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of
the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.
(Ord. 2727, passed 12-13-2010)
§ 51.159 COST OF ABATEMENT OF A VIOLATION.
   Any person causing a violation of this subchapter which requires the city to
expend public funds for the response to the violation, its abatement or the
cleanup or removal of any prohibited discharges, pollutants or hazardous
materials shall be liable to the city for all recoverable costs incurred by the
city for such response, cleanup and removal, including but not limited to,
personnel costs of the Police Department, Fire Department, Public Works
Department and other responding city departments, replacement costs of supplies
and equipment contaminated as a result of the discharge, proper disposal of
contaminated materials, cleanup, evacuation and administrative and other
expenses, including legal expenses, incurred in recovering such costs. Any such
illegal discharges shall be considered a public health hazard and the city
shall have a lien against the property for its recoverable costs.

§ 51.190 HARMFUL CONTRIBUTIONS; SUSPENSION OF WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION PERMIT.
   (A)   The Manager of the GWSC may suspend the wastewater treatment service
and/or a wastewater contribution permit when suspension is necessary, in the
opinion of the Manager, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the
POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
   (B)   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Manager shall take those steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The Manager shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit
and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
non-complying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Manager within 15 days
of the date of occurrence.

sign or signs exhibiting the words “Go,” “Caution” or “Stop,” or exhibiting
different colored lights for purposes of traffic control, the following colors
only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows.
   (A)   Green alone or “Go.” Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time
the signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or “Caution” when shown following the green or
“Go” signal. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or “Stop.” Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line and shall remain
standing until green or “Go” is shown alone.
   (D)   Flashing red alone. Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point
as may be indicated by a clearly visible line and shall not again proceed until
it can do so without danger.
   (E)   Flashing amber alone. Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall reduce
its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection controlled by the
signal.
   (F)   “Yield Right-of-Way.” Vehicular traffic facing the “Yield Right-of-
Way” sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within the primary
intersecting or merging right-of-way. No vehicle facing a “Yield Right-of-Way”
sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a speed in excess
of 15 mph, except that this speed limit shall not apply to vehicles entering an
expressway.
   (G)   Lane lights.
      (1)   When lane lights are installed over any street for the purpose of
controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic shall move only
in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear.
      (2)   However, when flashing amber lights appear above a lane all left
turns shall be made from that lane. Where red arrows appear above such lanes,
vehicles shall not move against them. If flashing amber lights show above a
lane, that lane shall be used only for passing and for left turns unless a sign
at such place prohibits the turn.

railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the movement of
traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or signal. No
person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority permit on any

public utility of the city in any emergency or temporarily from marking or
erecting any traffic barrier or sign whose placing has been approved by the
city.

§ 91.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing

aggrieved”) may file a complaint with the Mayor. Complaints shall be in writing
and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Mayor requires.
Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Mayor shall furnish a copy of the same to
the person or persons who allegedly committed or are about to commit the
alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within 30 days after receiving a
complaint, or within 30 days after the expiration of any period of reference
under division (C) below, the Mayor shall investigate the complaint and give
notice, in writing, to the person aggrieved whether he or she intends to
resolve it. If the Mayor decides to resolve the complaints, he or she shall
proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing
practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion.
Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made
public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter
without the written consent of the persons concerned. No employee of the Mayor
shall make public any information in violation of this provision.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) above shall be filed within 180 days
after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be
in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegation of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint
against him or her and with the leave of the Mayor, which shall be granted
whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his or her answer
at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the Mayor, the Mayor
has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this chapter, the person
aggrieved may, within 30 days thereafter, file a complaint with the Secretary
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Mayor will assist in
this filing.
   (D)   If the Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance within 30
days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days hereafter,
commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the respondent named
in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected by this chapter,
insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint. If the court
finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur,
the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in the practice or order such
affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the

reasonable times, to premises, records, documents, individuals and other
evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy such
materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as
are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation. The Mayor
shall first comply with the provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to
unreasonable searches and seizures. The Mayor may issue subpoenas to compel
access to or the production of the materials or the appearance of the persons
and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject
to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were
issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States district court
for the district in which the investigation is taking place. The Mayor may
administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the Mayor, a respondent shall be entitled
to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the
Mayor to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas
issued by the Mayor himself or herself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a
respondent shall show on their face the name and address of the respondent and
shall state that they were issued at his or her request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Mayor shall be entitled to the
same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United States
district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the
request of a respondent, shall be paid by him or her.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the
person may petition the Mayor to revoke or modify the subpoena. The Mayor shall
grant the petition if he or she finds that the subpoena requires appearance or
attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of
evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does
not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that
compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Mayor or other
person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the
state court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was
addressed resides, was served or transacts business.
   (F)   No person shall willfully fail or neglect to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence,
if in his or her power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order
of the Mayor. No person shall, with intent thereby to mislead the Mayor, make
or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any report,
account, record or other document submitted to the Mayor pursuant to his or her
subpoena or other order or willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be
made full, true and correct entries in the reports, accounts, records or other
documents, or willfully mutilate, alter or by any other means falsify any
documentary evidence.

participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this chapter.

discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that, the court
shall continue the civil case brought pursuant to this section or §
91.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial, if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the Mayor are likely to result in satisfactory
settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained of in the
complaint made to the Mayor and which practice forms the basis for the action
in court.
      (3)   Any sale, encumbrance or rental consummated prior to the issuance
of any court order issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a
bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer or tenant without actual notice of the
existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of
this chapter shall not be affected.
   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $l,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of
a prevailing plaintiff; provided that, the plaintiff in the opinion of the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 99.01 INTENT AND DECLARATION OF PUBLIC POLICY.
   (A)   The City Council finds that buildings within the city having historic,
architectural or cultural value have been significantly altered or destroyed
notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of preserving these buildings
or altering them in an appropriate way.
   (B)   The Council finds that the historic and architectural character of
Glasgow is of vital importance in maintaining the economy of the city.
   (C)   The Council finds that Glasgow has played an important role in the
development of Kentucky and that the history of the city is shown today through
buildings representing the activities and events during its growth. The Council
finds that the city has buildings that represent the persons who live or have
lived in Glasgow during a period of more than 100 years. It is the finding of
the City Council that the distinctive and significant character of the city can
only be maintained by protecting and enhancing its historic, architectural and
cultural heritage and by preventing unnecessary injury to its historic
districts and its landmarks which are a civic and community asset. The Council
finds that the Federal and Kentucky Governments have passed laws to protect
historic districts and landmarks and that the national Historic Preservation
Act was amended in 1980 to establish a certified local government program
creating a new federal-state-local partnership to encourage the efforts by
cities to protect and preserve their historic districts and landmarks.
   (D)   The Council finds that the adoption of an ordinance to provide a
historic preservation program will benefit all the residents of Glasgow and all
the owners of property.
   (E)   The City Council declares as a matter of public policy that the
preservation, protection and use of historic districts and landmarks are a
public benefit because they have a special character and historic,
architectural and cultural value and thus serve as visible reminders of the
history and heritage of the city, state and nation. The Council declares as a
matter of public policy that this chapter is required in the interest of the
health, prosperity, safety, welfare and economic well-being of the people.
   (F)   The Council finds that the Main Street program will contribute to the
revival of the central business district in Glasgow, that it will increase the
awareness of the value of the older buildings in the city, and that the
historic preservation program will strengthen the current revitalization work
in the city.
   (G)   The purpose of this chapter is to effect the goals as set forth in the
above findings and declarations of public policy and specifically, but not
exclusively, to:
      (1)   Protect, enhance and perpetuate the distinctive historical and/or
architectural characteristics of Glasgow which represent elements of the city’s
social, cultural, economic, political and architectural history;
      (2)   Promote the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of
the people and safeguard the city’s history and heritage as embodied and
reflected in its historic districts and landmarks;
      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values of Glasgow’s landmarks and
historic districts;
      (4)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable accomplishments of the
past;
      (5)   Strengthen the economy of the city;
      (6)   Protect and enhance the city’s attractiveness to tourists and
visitors and the support of business and industry thereby provided; and
      (7)   Promote and assist in the development and growth, where the
development or growth is consistent with the inherent value of the historic
buildings, places or areas of Glasgow.

individual landmarks and landmark sites and historic districts, and the City
Council may make these designations by the enactment of ordinances.
Consideration of the designation of a landmark and landmark site or a historic
district may be originated by the Commission or by filing of an application for
designation by a property owner, any resident of Glasgow or any organization in
Glasgow. A person or organization proposing a designation shall give the
Commission the names and addresses of the owners of the affected property and
the owners of all adjoining property as listed on the tax rolls of the city.
   (B)   To start the designation process, the Commission shall assemble
information about the district or property being considered for designation and
shall schedule a public hearing on the proposed designation. Advertised notice
of the hearing shall be given, including conspicuous posting on the property or
in the proposed district for 15 consecutive days immediately prior to the
hearing. At least 15 days prior to the public hearing written notice shall be
given by registered mail to the owners of property under consideration and the
owners of all adjoining property. Written notice shall be considered sufficient
when it is mailed to the person listed on the tax rolls of the city.
   (C)   Before its first public hearing on a designation, the Commission shall
adopt general guidelines, which shall be approved by the City Council, that
will apply to Glasgow’s historic districts and landmarks and will assist owners
in the preservation and rehabilitation of their property. The general
guidelines shall include The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and may
include other guidelines that will apply to all designated property in the
city. Before each public hearing on a designation, the Commission may adopt
additional guidelines that will apply to the property under consideration if it
is designated. The guidelines shall not limit new construction to any one
architectural style, but shall seek to preserve the character and integrity of
the landmarks or the historic districts. The guidelines shall suggest changes
that would be appropriate for landmarks or for property in historic districts.
After a designation, the Commission may expand or amend the guidelines it has
adopted provided it holds a public hearing on the changes and submits the
proposed changes to the Planning Commission for its comments and the City
Council for its approval.
   (D)   A landmark or historic district shall qualify for designation when it
meets one or more of the following criteria which shall be discussed in a
Commission report making its recommendations to the City Council:
      (1)   Its value as a reminder of the cultural or archaeological heritage
of the city, state or nation;
      (2)   Its location as a site of a significant local, state or national
event;
      (3)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the city, state or nation;
      (4)   Its identification as the work of a master builder, designer or
architect whose individual work has influenced the development of the city,
state or nation;
      (5)   Its value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that retains sufficient elements showing its architectural
significance;
      (6)   Its distinguished characteristics of an architectural style
valuable for the study of a period, method of construction or use of indigenous
materials;
      (7)   Its character as a geographically definable area possessing a
significant concentration or continuity of sites, buildings, objects or
structures united by past events or aesthetically by its plan or physical
development; or
      (8)   Its character as an established and geographically definable
residential neighborhood, united by culture, architectural styles or physical
plan and development.
   (E)   After evaluating the testimony at its public hearing, survey
information and other material it has assembled, the Commission shall make its
recommendation to the City Council with a written report on the area or
property under consideration. The report shall also contain information about
the buildings and sites that have been identified for inclusion in the proposed
designation. The recommendation and the report shall also be sent to the
Planning Commission.
   (F)   The Planning Commission shall then report on the relationship between
the proposed historic district designation and existing and future plans for
the development of the city. If the Planning Commission approves of the
proposed designation, it shall amend the Comprehensive Plan to include the
proposed historic designation. The Planning Commission shall forward its
comments, the Comprehensive Plan amendment, and the zoning map change to the
City Council. If the Planning Commission does not approve of the proposed
designation, it shall forward its comments to the City Council in the form of a
recommendation.
   (G)   The City Council shall approve, modify or disapprove the proposed
designation and the map amendment within 60 days after receiving the
recommendation of the Commission and the material from the Planning Commission.
If the City Council decides to make a designation and no Comprehensive Plan
amendment has been adopted and no zoning map change has been recommended, the
City Council shall request the Planning Commission to reconsider its earlier
decisions and shall provide that the designation shall take effect after these
preliminary steps have been approved.
   (H)   (1)   The property in a historic district shall be subject to the
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations and other rules of its underlying
zoning district. A landmark shall be subject to the Zoning Ordinance and
Subdivision Regulations and other rules of its zoning district. When there is a
conflict between this chapter and the Zoning Ordinance or Subdivision
Regulations, the higher standard shall govern.
      (2)   Upon establishment of an overlay district, development within the
area shall conform to all zoning regulations applicable to the area and shall
also conform to all historic overlay district regulations.
   (I)   The Commission shall notify each owner of the decision relating to his
or her property and shall arrange that the designation of a property as a
landmark or as a part of a historic district be recorded in the land records of
the county by owner’s name and tax district lot and block number. The
Commission shall also give notice of the decision to the government offices in
the city and county, which shall retain them for future reference.
   (J)   The amendment or rescission of any designation shall be accomplished
through the same steps as were followed in the original designation.

            10.   Fire-time painting or permanent removal of paint;
         (b)   New construction;
         (c)   Demolition; or
         (d)   Relocation.
      (2)   A certificate of appropriateness is required even when the proposed
work does not require a building permit. When seeking a building permit for a
project involving designated property, a person must submit a certificate of
appropriateness approving any of the work listed in this division (A).
   (B)   (1)   When a person wishes to undertake an exterior alteration visible
to the public affecting a landmark, a landmark site or a property in a historic
district that does not require a building permit, that person shall apply
directly to the Commission for a certificate of appropriateness. The applicant
shall provide, where applicable, drawings of the proposed work, photographs of
the existing building or structure or site and adjacent properties, and
information about the building materials to be used.
      (2)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall forward to the Commission every
application for a permit that would authorize an exterior alteration visible to
the public, new construction, demolition or relocation affecting the landmark,
a landmark site or a property in a historic district. The Code Enforcement
Officer shall give the applicant a form from the Commission requesting
additional information from the applicant.
   (C)   (1)   In the event work is being performed without the required
certificate of appropriateness, the Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a stop
work order. In the event that work requiring a certificate of appropriateness,
but not a building permit is being performed without the required certificate
of appropriateness, the Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a stop work order.
In the event work is being performed which is not in accordance with the
certificate, the Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a stop work order and any
law enforcement officer may cite violators in District Court.
      (2)   No additional work shall be undertaken as long as a stop work order
shall continue in effect.
      (3)   The city may apply to Circuit Court for an injunction to enforce
its stop work order and any other appropriate relief in order that the intent
of this chapter shall be carried out.
      (4)   The Commission shall meet with the owner or his or her agent to
resolve the problem.
      (5)   The City Attorney may seek in Circuit Court an injunction.
   (D)   (1)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing on each certificate
of appropriateness within 45 days after a completed application is received by
the Commission. The Commission shall make a decision on the application within
45 days after the receipt of a completed application; provided that, the
Commission may extend the time for decision an additional 60 days when the
application is for demolition or new construction. The Commission shall approve
or disapprove each application and it shall give its reasons for its decision
using the criteria contained in this section and in its guidelines. The
Commission may suggest modifications to an application and may then approve a
certificate of appropriateness providing for revisions in the plans submitted.
If the Commission fails to decide on an application within the specified time
period, the application shall be deemed approved.
      (2)   Applicants shall be given notice of the public hearings and
meetings relating to their applications and shall be informed of the
Commission’s decision. When an application has been approved, the applicant
shall be given a certificate of appropriateness. Advertised notice of the
public hearing shall be given, including conspicuous posting on the property
for five consecutive days immediately prior to the hearing.
   (E)   (1)   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall use
the general guidelines and the guidelines it has adopted for that landmark or
historic district. The Commission shall consider:
         (a)   The effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the property
upon which the work is to be done; and
         (b)   The relationship between the work and other structures on the
landmark site or other property in the historic district.
      (2)   In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the Commission shall
consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style,
design, texture, materials and color. The certificate of appropriateness from
the Commission shall not relieve the applicant from complying with the
requirements of other state and local laws and regulations.
   (F)   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall be aware
of the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the applicant.
The Commission shall also recognize the importance of approving plans that will
be reasonable for the applicant to carry out. Before an applicant prepares his
or her plans, he or she may bring a tentative proposal to the Commission for
its comments.
   (G)   (1)   The Commission shall prepare a list of routine alterations that
shall receive immediate approval without a public hearing when an applicant
complies with the written guidelines of the Commission. At each meeting, the
Commission shall be informed of the certificates of appropriateness that have
been issued under this provision. The Commission shall not regulate the color
of paint used on designated property, but it may prepare and distribute
material on paint colors appropriate for different types and styles of
buildings.
      (2)   Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a landmark, a landmark
site or a property in a historic district does not change its exterior
appearance that is visible to the public. Every person in charge of a landmark
or a property in a historic district shall keep it in good repair:
         (a)   All of the exterior portions of the buildings or structures; and
         (b)   All interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may
cause the buildings or structures to deteriorate, to become damaged or
otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair. The purpose of this provision is
to prevent a person from forcing the demolition of his building by neglecting
it and by permitting damage to the building because of weather or vandalism.
      (3)   No provision in this chapter shall be interpreted to require an
owner or tenant to undertake an alteration or to restore his building to its
original appearance. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to the
provisions of the Kentucky Building Code requiring buildings and structures to
be kept in good repair.
   (H)   The Commission shall request a meeting with a property owner when his
or her landmark or his or her building in a historic district is in poor repair
and the Commission shall discuss with the owner ways to improve the condition
of his or her property. After this step, the Commission may request the Code
Enforcement Officer to take action to require correction of defects in any
building or structure designated under this chapter, so that the building or
structure shall be preserved in accordance with the purposes of this chapter.
Action taken by the City may include boarding up the doors, windows and other
parts of the building and additional steps to stabilize walls, roofs and other
parts of the building or structure in accordance with
Chapter 95 of this code of ordinances. The Commission shall request a meeting
with the owner of properties within a historic district that it considers to be
vacant or underutilized, and the Commission shall discuss with each owner ways
to better their property so that it might better contribute to the economic
well- being and preservation of the historic district.
   (I)   (1)   When a property is damaged by fire, storm or other unexpected
events, the owner or tenant may receive approval from the Chairperson or Vice-
Chairperson of the Commission for the work to be done in response to this
emergency. At its next meeting, the Commission shall be informed of the
certificates of appropriateness that were issued. In situations requiring
temporary action, an owner may do work in order to temporarily protect the
property from further damage provided the owner reports this work to the
Commission within two business days.
      (2)   An owner shall immediately notify the Code Enforcement Officer of
emergency conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting a
landmark, a landmark site or a property in a historic district and the owner
shall promptly provide evidence of the dangerous conditions that has been
prepared by a person with professional qualifications in evaluating buildings
and structures.
      (3)   In any case where the Code Enforcement Officer determines that
there are emergency conditions dangerous to life health, or property affecting
a landmark, a landmark site or a property in a historic district, he or she may
order remedying of these conditions without the approval of the Commission. The
Code Enforcement Officer shall promptly notify the Chairperson of the
Commission of the action being taken.
   (J)   (1)   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark, a building or
structure on a landmark site or a building or structure in a historic district,
the Commission shall negotiate with the applicant to see if an alternative to
demolition can be found. The Commission may ask interested individuals and
organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to demolition and in
obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs for the threatened building. After
its public hearing, the Commission may decide that a building or structure in a
historic district or on a landmark site may be demolished because it does not
contribute to the historic district or to a landmark site.
      (2)   On all other demolition applications, the Commission shall study
the question of economic hardship for the applicant and shall determine whether
the landmark or the property in the historic district can be put to reasonable
beneficial use without the approval of the demolition application. In the case
of an income-producing building, the Commission shall also determine whether
the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from his building. The Commission
may ask applicants for additional information to be used in making these
determinations. These determinations shall be in addition to the points
contained in division (E) above. If economic hardship or the lack of a
reasonable return is not proved, the Commission shall deny the demolition
application unless the Commission finds grounds to grant the demolition
application under the points contained in division (E) above.
   (K)   (1)   When the applicant wishes to move a landmark, a building or
structure on a landmark site or a building or structure in a historic district
or wishes to move a building or structure to a landmark site or to a property
in a historic district, the Commission shall consider:
         (a)   The contribution the building or structure makes to its present
setting;
         (b)   Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated;
         (c)   Whether the building or structure can be moved without
significant damage to its physical integrity; and
         (d)   The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed
site and adjacent properties.
      (2)   These considerations shall be in addition to the points contained
in § 99.31(E).
   (L)   (1)   A certificate of appropriateness shall remain valid for one year
after it is issued. Work is required to start before the end of the one-year
period. If actual work is not commenced within one year the certificate is
invalid.
      (2)   For the purpose of this division (L), the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
         ACTUAL WORK. Includes the placing of construction materials in
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or
demolition is required preparatory to rebuilding, the excavation or demolition
shall be deemed to be actual work; provided that, it shall be carried out
diligently.
   (M)   The applicant shall have an appeal to the City Council from a decision
of the Commission denying an application for a certificate of appropriateness.
The appeal must be filed, in writing, with the City Clerk within 14 days after
the decision of the Commission. The City Council shall hold a public hearing
and shall vote on the appeal within 60 days of its receipt. The City Council
shall transmit its decision, in writing, to the applicant, the Commission and
the Code Enforcement Officer.
   (N)   New owners. Purchase of a building in the downtown historic district
requires:
      (1)   Communication with the Historic Preservation Commission to ensure
all requirements of the Historic Preservation District are understood and to
acknowledge any outstanding business or violations with the Historic
Preservation Commission; and
      (2)   A good faith effort by the property owner to communicate with the
Commission regarding any proposed alterations and/or maintenance beyond that
what is defined by this chapter as ordinary.

§ 99.33 CONFORMITY WITH THE CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   (1)   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness
shall conform to the provisions of the certificate.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the Zoning Administrator and the
Commission to inspect from time to time any work being performed to assure the
compliance in the event work is being performed which is not in accordance with
the certificate, the Commission shall direct the Code Enforcement Officer to
issue a stop work order.
      (3)   All work shall cease on the designated property.
   (B)   No additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order
shall continue in effect. The Commission shall meet with the owner or tenant to
resolve the problem. The City Attorney may seek in Circuit Court an injunction
and any other appropriate relief in order that the intent of this chapter shall
be carried out.
(Ord. 2400, passed 1-28-2002)
§ 99.34 EMERGENCY CONSIDERATION.
   In the case of unusual circumstances whereby the normal process for
obtaining a certificate of appropriateness as set forth in this chapter creates
undue hardship for the health, safety and welfare of an applicant, the
Commission may, at its discretion, waive the normal process and give immediate
approval for a certificate of appropriateness. The Commission shall site its
reasons, in writing, for the immediate approval.
(Ord. 2400, passed 1-28-2002)
§ 99.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
fined not less than $50, nor more than $500 for each offense. Each day’s
violation shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   Within 30 days of notice the city shall levy a fine on the property of
such a person or entity committing the violation for all unpaid fines,
penalties, charges, and fees imposed pursuant to this chapter. The lien shall
be superior to and have priority over all other subsequent liens on the
property, except state, county, school and city taxes.
   (C)   Civil penalties imposed for violation of this chapter shall be
enforced by and through the provisions of
Chapter 36 regarding the Code Enforcement Officer and Code Enforcement Board.

shall be apportioned as follows:
         (a)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in

section, plus the sales factor, described in division (C) of this section, and
the denominator of which is two; and

      (2)   For the purposes of divisions (A) through (D) of this section, the
business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the Occupational
Tax Office.

amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.

sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sales, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:

         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenue from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city, or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or

110.03.
   (B)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter ending
thereafter, on or before the end of the month following the close of each
quarter, make a return and report to the city, and pay to the city, the tax
required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is permitted or
required to report within a reasonable time after some other period as
determined by the city.
   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any sums
required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to be
withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section

a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the city, shall be submitted.

person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to

severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid to one or
more employees of any business entity, and neither the corporate dissolution or
withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor the cessation of holding
any corporate office, shall discharge that liability of any person; provided
that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each or every person
holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became obligated.
No person shall be personally and individually liable under this division who
had no authority to collect, truthfully account for, or pay over any tax

   (I)   Every employee receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax
imposed under §
110.03 shall be personally liable for the tax notwithstanding the provisions of
divisions (G) and (H) of this section. In all cases where the employer does not
withhold the tax levied under this section from the employee, such employee or
employees shall be responsible for filing with the city each quarter in the
same manner as if they were the employer. If an employer fails to or is not
required to withhold, report, or pay the license fee it shall become the duty
of the employee to file with the city. The only employer that is not required
to withhold, report, and pay the occupational license tax is the Federal
Government including the United States Postal Service. The payment required to
be made by an employee, can be made quarterly, for the periods ending March

Security number of each employee of the employer during the preceding calendar
year, giving the amount of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation
earned during such preceding year by each such employee. This list shall
include all current full-time employees, part-time employees, temporary
employees, and terminated employees whether it be voluntary or involuntary.

persons or business entities is subject to the license fee and tax imposed by
this chapter, with the following exception: Natural persons who offer no more
than five residential units for rent. A UNIT shall be considered one
residential dwelling, regardless of its configuration. In other words, a unit
could be a rental home, or a single dwelling within a multi-dwelling structure
such as an apartment complex or duplex. If this applies, then no license fee
shall be imposed.

   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax governed
by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under oath
statements, make returns, and comply with rules as the city from time to time
may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may require a
business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a return,
render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems sufficient to
determine the tax liability the business entity.
   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the taxable income
of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of the business
entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.
   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business entity, as
appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the city at the time
prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return, determined without
regard to any extension of time for filing the return.
   (F)   It shall be the responsibility of persons who make Federal Form 1099
"non-employee compensation" payments to natural persons other than employees
for services performed within the city, to maintain records of such payments
and to report such payments to the city. Said payments must be reported on by
remitting Federal Form 1099 by February 28 of the year following the close of
the calendar year in which the non-employee compensation was paid. If a

IRS, including but not limited to payments less than $600, they are still
liable to remit the equivalent information to the city. The information
required to be reported by said licensee shall include:

identification number;
      (2)   Recipient's name and address;

115.42 within 12 months of the award of a franchise. Each initial franchise
shall require as a condition of the franchise the posting of a performance bond
for the city's benefit in an amount equal to one-half of the estimated
construction cost for reimbursement of any city expenses incurred in the event
of default, including, but not limited to the removal of partially constructed
facilities. The franchise agreement shall specify that failure to timely comply
with the franchise construction conditions will cause the franchise to become
null and void without further action by the city.
   (C)   In evaluating an application for an initial franchise, the city shall
consider the applicant's character; the applicant's technical, financial and
legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed cable system; the
nature of the proposed facilities, equipment and services; the applicant's and
its principals' record in other communities, if any; the impact of construction
on public rights-of-way in the city. including any disruption or adverse effect

impact upon public and private property within the city; the economic
feasibility of the application; impact on the city's obligation to assure the
broadest possible access to cable service; and whether the proposal will meet
anticipated community needs and serve the public interest.
   (D)   Based upon the application, the written and oral testimony and other
material presented at a public hearing before the Council, and any other
information relevant to the application, the Council shall decide whether to
grant or deny an initial franchise application. If two or more competing
applications are filed in response to a request for proposals, the Council
shall grant the application that it considers to represent the highest and best
bid in terms of the overall public interest. However, the Council is not
obligated to grant any application for an initial franchise if it considers
that the public interest is not served thereby.
   (E)   If the Council grants an initial franchise application, the Mayor and
the applicant must agree on the terms of a franchise agreement within 90
calendar days from the date of the resolution making the grant. This period may
be extended for good cause by the Council. If agreement is not reached with the
Mayor within 90 calendar days or if the period is not extended by the Council,
the franchise grant will be null and void without further action by the city.
   (F)   The text of a proposed franchise agreement must be consistent with the
requirements of this chapter and be made available by the city to the public
and advertised as required by city procedures. A proposed franchise agreement
shall not be deemed inconsistent with this chapter by virtue of authorizing or
permitting the provision of services other than cable service over the cable
system and its facilities.
   (G)   After complying with the applicable requirements of divisions (C)
through (F) of this section, the Council shall, following a public hearing,
approve or disapprove the proposed franchise agreement by resolution.
   (H)   The grant of an initial or renewal franchise may be subject to a
franchise acceptance fee in an amount not to exceed the city's out-of-pocket
costs in considering the application, less the amount of the filing fee. Within
30 calendar days of the date the resolution approving the initial or renewal
franchise agreement, the city shall notify the approved applicant of the amount
of any franchise acceptance fee and its method of calculation. If the franchise
acceptance fee is not paid within 60 calendar days of the date of the Council
resolution approving the franchise agreement, the grant will be null and void.
Prior to the franchise becoming effective, the approved applicant must
demonstrate compliance with the surety, insurance, bonding and similar
provisions of the franchise agreement.
(1989 Code, § 115.20) (Ord. 1988, passed 11-9-1992)
§ 115.21 SECURITY FUND.
   (A)   Prior to the franchise becoming effective, the city may require a
franchisee to post a cash security deposit as specified in the franchise
agreement to be used as a security fund to ensure the faithful performance of
all provisions of law and the franchise agreement and compliance with all
orders, permits and directions of the city, and the payment by the franchisee
of any claims, liens or taxes due the city which arise by reason of the
construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system.
   (B)   The city shall place any such security deposit in an interest bearing
account. The interest will accrue to the benefit of the franchisee but may not
be withdrawn; all interest will be added to and become part of the original
security fund during the term of the franchise.
   (C)   If a franchisee fails to pay the city any fees or taxes due,
liquidated damages, damages or costs or expenses incurred by the city by reason
of any act or default of the franchisee, or if the franchisee fails to comply
with any provision of the franchise agreement that the city reasonably
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of the security fund, the city
may, after ten calendar days notice to the franchisee, withdraw that amount
with any interest from the security fund. Upon the withdrawal, the city shall
notify the franchisee of the amount and date of the withdrawal.
   (D)   Within 30 calendar days after notice to it that an amount has been
withdrawn by the city from the security fund, the franchisee must deposit a sum
of money sufficient to restore the security fund to the original amount. If the
franchisee fails to restore the security fund to the original amount within 30
calendar days, the entire security fund remaining may be forfeited, and/or the
failure may be considered a material breach of this chapter and may be used as
grounds for revocation of the franchise.
   (E)   The security fund will become the property of the city in the event
the franchise is revoked. The franchisee is entitled to the return of the
security fund that remains following termination of the franchise, less any
outstanding default or unpaid amounts owed to the city by the franchisee.
   (F)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are
in addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by this chapter or
authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with
respect to the security fund will affect any other right the city may have.
   (G)   Notwithstanding the above, a franchise shall not be revoked because of
a franchisee's failure to comply with this section while the franchisee is
challenging the city's exercise of its rights under this section by arbitration
or to an agency or court of appropriate jurisdiction.

employees against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and
judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction,
maintenance or operation of the franchisee's cable system regardless of whether
the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the
franchise. This provision includes, but is not limited to claims arising out of
copyright infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure consents from
the owners, authorized distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by
the cable system. This section shall not require a private franchisee to
indemnify the city (or its agents, including those enumerated above) for any
liabilities incurred by a municipally-owned cable system, or where the
liability results from the intentional wrongdoing or misconduct of the city (or
its agents, including those enumerated above).
   (C)   (1)   The franchise agreement may require the franchisee to have in
force at all times a performance bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in an
amount as necessary to ensure the faithful performance by the franchisee of its
obligation under the franchise agreement.
      (2)   The surety instruments must be provided by an entity qualified to
do business in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and in a form approved by the City

   (B)   Any payment of franchise fees to adjust for a shortfall in the
quarterly payments for the preceding year must be made no later than the filing

for each type of service for which a separate charge is made, during the period
covered by the payments and the number of subscribers served, with subtotals
reflecting the number for each type of service, at the end of the period. The
financial statement shall be certified as accurate by an official of the
franchisee who is knowledgeable and responsible for its preparation.
   (D)   The city may inspect any and all books and records of the franchisee
specifically relating to its compliance with its franchise fee obligations, and
recompute any amounts determined to be payable under the franchise. The cost of
the inspection will be borne by the franchisee if the annual payment to the
city is increased by more than 10% as a result of the inspection.
   (E)   (1)   In the event that a franchise payment is not received by the
city on or before the due date, interest will be charged from the due date at
an interest rate of 1.5 % per month. Interest will not be imposed for any

year. Adjustments will be made at that time for franchise fees due to the date
that the franchisee's operations ceased.

the city must notify the franchisee that it may file a renewal application. The
notice must specify the information to be included in the renewal application
and the deadline for filing the application, which must be no earlier than 45
calendar days following the date of the notice. If the franchisee does not
submit a renewal application by the specified date, it will be deemed not to be
seeking renewal of its franchise.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the renewal application, the city shall publish
notice of its receipt and may schedule one or more public meetings or implement
other procedures under which comments from the public on the application may be
received.
   (B)   In considering a renewal application, the city must consider whether:
      (1)   The franchisee has substantially complied with the material terms
of the existing franchise and with applicable law;
      (2)   The quality of the franchisee's cable service, including signal
quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices (but without
regard to the mix, quality or level of cable service provided over the cable
system has been reasonable in light of community needs;
      (3)   The franchisee has the financial, legal and technical ability to
provide the services, facilities and equipment set forth in its proposal; and

the needs and interests.
   (C)   The Council shall hold at least one public hearing to consider the
application. An advisory committee or a committee of the Council may make
recommendations to the Council prior to its consideration, a copy of which
recommendations shall be made available to the franchisee at least seven days
in advance of the Council's consideration. Following the public hearing on the
renewal application, the Council must either:
      (1)   Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise, subject to the
negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the city and the
franchisee, or
      (2)   Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the
franchise should not be renewed.
   (D)   The Council's action under division (C) above must be taken within
four months after the date of the submission of a renewal application in
accordance with division (A)(2) above.

renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, the city
must commence an administrative proceeding in accordance with § 626(c) of the
Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c).
   (F)   The city shall commence an administrative proceeding, initiated by a
hearing order which establishes the issues to be addressed in the hearing and
the procedures to be followed and appoints a presiding officer acceptable to
the franchisee, who shall be unaffiliated with either the city or the

provided adequate notice and the franchisee and city shall be afforded fair
opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence,
including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under division
(A)(1) of this section, to require the production of evidence, and to question
witnesses. A transcript shall be made of the hearing. Upon the completion of
the hearing, the presiding officer shall issue a recommended written decision.
Parties to the hearing and the public shall have 30 calendar days to comment on
the recommended decision after its issuance.

presented, and other evidence of record, the Council, following a public
hearing, shall make a final determination on whether to grant or deny the
renewal application. The Council shall issue a written decision setting forth
the reasons for its decision. Any denial of a proposal for renewal shall be
based upon one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors
described in divisions (B)(1) through (4) of this section, pursuant to the
record under divisions (A) through (F) above. The city shall not base a denial
of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the
franchise or on events considered under division (B)(2) of this section in any
case in which a violation of the franchise or the events considered under
division (B)(2) of this section occur after the effective date of the Cable

franchisee may submit a proposal for renewal of a franchise in accordance with
47 U.S.C. § 546(h) at any time. The city must hold one or more public hearings
or implement other procedures under which comments on the proposal from the
public may be received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the
Council shall determine whether the franchise should be renewed and the terms
and conditions of any renewal in making its determination, the Council shall
not consider the pendency of any other application for a franchise. The denial
of a renewal pursuant to this division shall not affect action on a renewal
proposal that is submitted in accordance with divisions (A) through (G) above.
   (I)   Once the Council grants a renewal application, the city and the
franchisee must agree on a franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures
specified in §
115.20 (E) through (J), before the renewal becomes effective.
   (J)   If renewal of a franchise is denied, the city may require the former
franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment; provided, however, that, a
franchisee may not be required to terminate or alter its cable service or
remove its facilities and equipment until the franchisee's right to judicial
review of the city's renewal decision has been exhausted. If the former
franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may have
the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense.

§ 115.25 TRANSFERS.
   (A)   A transfer of a franchise must not occur without prior approval of the
city, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld consistent with the
considerations specified in division (C) below.
   (B)   An application to transfer a franchise must meet the requirements of §
115.19 and provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including
details on the legal, character, financial, technical and other pertinent
qualifications of the transferee. At minimum, the information required in §
115.19(E)(1) through (4) must be provided by the proposed transferee. The
information required in §
115.19(E)(5) through (10) must also be provided whenever the proposed
transferee expects material changes to occur in those areas.
   (C)   Final action on an application for transfer of a franchise shall be
taken by the Council within 60 days after the submission of the application
unless extended for good cause by the Council, such as the need for additional
information. Absent such action or extension, the application shall be deemed
granted on the sixty-first day following its filing. In making a determination
on such an application, the Council will consider the legal, financial,
technical and character qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable
system and whether such a transfer would be consistent with the public
interest. The approval shall not be conditioned upon modification of the
franchise agreement. In addition, to the extent that effective competition
exists in the city, information pertaining to the financial terms of a pending
transfer shall not be relevant to the approval process.
   (D)   Where an application involves a pro forma transfer, the transfer
application shall be considered automatically granted on the eleventh business
day after its filing with the city unless the city notifies the applicant
otherwise prior to that date.
   (E)   Approval by the city of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute
a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this chapter or the
franchise agreement.
(1989 Code, § 115.25) (Ord. 1988, passed 11-9-1992)
§ 115.26 REVOCATION OR TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   A franchise may be revoked by the Council for material failure to
construct as required, operate or maintain the cable system as required by this
chapter or the franchise agreement or for other material breach of this chapter
or the franchise agreement. However, where the city has issued a franchise
specifically conditioned upon the completion of construction or other specific
obligation by a specified date pursuant to §
115.20(B), failure of the franchisee to complete construction or comply with
other specific obligation as required will result in the automatic forfeiture
of the franchise without further action by the city, unless the city, at its
discretion and for good cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an
extension of time. If within 60 calendar days following written notice from the
city to the franchisee that it is in substantial and material breach of this
chapter or the franchise agreement, the franchisee has not taken corrective
action or corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued,
the Council, acting on its own motion or upon the recommendation of the Mayor,
may give written notice to the franchisee of its intent to consider revocation
of the franchise, stating its reasons therefor.
   (B)   Before final action can be taken, the city shall commence an
administrative proceeding, initiated by a hearing order which establishes the
issues to be addressed in the hearing and the procedures to be followed and
appoints a presiding officer acceptable to the franchisee, who shall be
unaffiliated with either the city or the franchisee, for the hearing. In any
such hearing, the franchisee shall be provided adequate notice and the
franchisee and city shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation
including the right to introduce evidence, to require the production of
evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of the hearing.
Upon the completion of the hearing, the presiding officer shall issue a
recommended written decision. Parties to the hearing and the public shall have
30 calendar days to comment on the recommended decision after its issuance.
Based on the recommended decision, the comment and arguments presented and
other evidence of record, the Council, following a public hearing, shall make a
final determination on whether to revoke the franchise. The Council shall issue
a written decision setting forth the reasons for its decision.
   (C)   Any franchise may, at the option of the city be revoked 120 calendar
days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or other action or proceedings unless within that 120-day period:
      (1)   The assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or
      (2)   The assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms
and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and has executed an
agreement, approved by the court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to
be bound by the terms, and conditions of the franchise.
   (D)   In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the
facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the city may revoke the
franchise by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at
the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the
franchise will be revoked 30 calendar days after serving the notice, unless:
      (1)   The city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the
successful bidder; and
      (2)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise.
   (E)   If the city revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a
franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to its
subscribers, the following procedures and rights are effective.
      (1)   The city may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities
and equipment. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable
period of time, the city may have the removal done at the franchisee's and/or
surety's expense.
      (2)   If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the city may sell,
assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system.
(1989 Code, § 115.26) (Ord. 1988, passed 11-9-1992)
§ 115.27 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Rates and charges must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner
consistent with the requirements of §
115.46.
   (B)   To the extent practicable, rates may be changed by the franchisee
following a minimum 30 days prior notice to the city and the customers.
   (C)   The city reserves the right to implement rate regulation when and if
permitted by federal law or regulations, and to amend this chapter to establish
applicable procedures.

of a municipal entity, that entity shall establish an independent citizens'
advisory committee which shall be responsible for selecting the identity of the
signals.

establish the selection parameters, such as the number of signals to be carried
of each general type, and impose cost limits. (1989 Code, § 115.40) (Ord. 1988,
passed 11-9-1992)
§ 115.41 COMPETITIVE CABLE OPERATIONS.
   Where the city has authorized two or more franchisees to provide cable
service on a competitive basis, the city shall make every reasonable effort to
ensure that its regulation does not unfairly or unreasonably burden one
competitor to the advantage of the other. Further, the city shall require the
competitors to adhere to conduct which constitutes fair competition and
comports with applicable antitrust laws.
(1989 Code, § 115.41) (Ord. 1988, passed 11-9-1992)
§ 115.42 MINIMUM FACILITIES AND SERVICES.

   (B)   Subject to the provisions of §
115.17(C), the city may waive minimum requirements of this section where, in
the judgment of the city, the waiver is justified in the public interest.
(1989 Code, § 115.42) (Ord. 1988, passed 11-9-1992)
§ 115.43 USL OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY; CONDITIONS OF ACCESS.

upon reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, conditions and rates.
      (3)   Copies of agreements for use of poles, conduits or other such
facilities must be filed with the city.
   (B)   All transmission lines, equipment and structures must be installed and

agreement.
   (C)   Suitable safety devices and practices as required by local, city,
state and federal laws, ordinances, regulations and permits must be used during
construction, maintenance and repair of a cable system; provided, however, the

compared to another.
   (D)   Upon 60 days prior notice by city to a franchisee, a franchisee must
remove, replace or modify, at its own expense, the installation of any of its
facilities within any public right-of-way when required to do so by the city to

   (E)   On streets and roads where electrical and telephone utility wiring are
located underground, at the time of initial construction, the cable must also
be located underground at the franchisee's expense. Between a street or road
and a subscriber's residence, the cable must be located underground if the
electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground if either
electrical or telephone utility wiring is aerial, a franchisee may install
aerial cable except where a property owner or resident requests underground
installation and agrees to bear the additional cost over aerial installation,
and to pay such additional cost in advance.
   (F)   A franchisee must obtain any required permits before causing any
damage or disturbance to public thoroughfares or private property as a result

   (I)   In addition to the provisions of §
115.15, no person who owns or controls any residential multiple dwelling unit,
trailer park, condominium or apartment complex, or subdivision shall
discriminate among cable television franchisees in providing them access to
lawful residents or tenants of the MDUs, parks, complexes or subdivisions.
(1989 Code, § 115.43) (Ord. 1988, passed 11-9-1992)
§ 115.44 REPORTS AND RECORDS.
   Within three months of the close of its fiscal year, a franchisee must file

the cable system;
   (B)   A financial statement, reporting the gross revenues for the cable

and practices upon which it is based.)
   (C)   A copy of updated maps depicting the location of all trunks where

any such entity has fewer than ten persons holding 5 % ownership interest, the
ten largest such holders. Notwithstanding the above, if a franchisee is a
publicly traded company or controlled by a publicly traded company, a copy of
relevant portions of company proxy statements which disclose ownership

preferences or advantages to any subscriber or potential subscriber to the
cable system, including preferences based on the geographic location of the
subscriber. Notwithstanding the above, franchisees shall be permitted to engage
in campaigns that result in different rates being temporarily offered to
subscribers for the promotion of new or additional services or service packages
for up to six months. Nothing herein shall prevent franchisees from offering
bulk billing rates.
   (B)   A franchisee must not deny cable service to any potential subscribers
because of the income of the residents of the area in which the subscribers

         (b)   For the purpose of this division (B)(1)(a), the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

charge for any cable service.
      (4)   No person shall resell a franchisee's cable services without the
franchisee's express, written consent.
      (5)   A franchisee may bring an action to restrain or enjoin a violation
or threatened violation of this section and for damages resulting from the
violation. A franchisee shall be entitled to issuance of such an injunction
upon a showing that a violation has occurred or will occur, without the need
for demonstrating irreparable injury, inadequacy of legal remedies or

damages and reasonable attorneys' fees to a franchisee if the franchisee
prevails in an action hereunder.
      (6)   A knowing violation of this section shall be deemed a misdemeanor
and shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $500 for each day of
infraction.
      (7)   If an unauthorized device designed to intercept, descramble or
decode a cable television signal is present on the premises or property
occupied and used by a person, it is presumed that the person knowingly used
the device to intercept, descramble or decode cable signals. If an unauthorized
cable connection is present on the premises or property occupied and used by a
person, it is presumed that the person knowingly used the connection to
intercept cable signals. If equipment of a franchisee which has been tampered
with, changed or modified is present on the premises or property occupied by a
person, it is presumed that the person knowingly used the equipment to
intercept, descramble or decode cable signals.
      (8)   Franchisees are expressly reserved their applicable rights and
remedies available in law or in equity.

all state and local regulations and good and accepted industry practices. Any
cable system owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by any utility shall
be subject to the same NESC and NEC standards as an unaffiliated franchisee's
cable system, and no application of different NESC and NEC standards to a
utility affiliated franchisee's cable system shall be justified because that
cable system also is utilized for utility or related services.
      (2)   Any franchisee in violation of this division shall indemnify any
other franchisee who incurs any necessary and reasonable expense due to the
non-compliance of a franchisee with this division.

request.
   (E)   All costs and expenses arising from the use of city-owned property or
facilities incident to inspections, makeready and construction of an additional
cable system in the city, including placing facilities underground, and all
other related costs including those of existing franchisees, city and
utilities, shall be borne by such additional cable system franchisee, and the
additional franchise shall be conditioned on the payment of these costs and
expenses by the franchisee.

a city official or employee to solicit or accept any such thing of value, for
the purpose of influencing the grant, modification, renewal, transfer or any
other matter affecting a franchise or the administration or enforcement of this
chapter. This provision shall not restrict attendance by representatives of the
city at occasional social gatherings where food and/or beverages may be served
by a franchisee where the intent of the functions is not directed at
influencing any specific action by the city.

provide studio space for access use. Access channels shall be carried on the
franchisee's lowest priced service offering.
      (2)   The franchisee shall have no control over the content of any
programming carried on access channels. The city may require a franchisee, or
select a non-profit corporation or other entity, to manage the access program
and to establish reasonable rules for the use of access channels consistent
with the requirements of this chapter, the franchise agreement and the intended
purpose of such channels. The rules shall be subject to review and approval by
the city and franchisee.
      (3)   The use of any public access channel shall be made available to any
city resident on a nondiscriminatory basis at no charge for channel use. Where
access studio facilities are located on a franchisee's premises, the franchisee
shall make its personnel available for consultation and assistance to access
users at no charge provided that such personnel can be spared from their normal
duties.
(1989 Code, § 115.50) (Ord. 1988, passed 11-9-1992)
§ 115.51 LINE EXTENSIONS.
   Unless a franchise agreement specifies otherwise, it shall be the obligation
of a franchisee to serve every residential area of the city and provide cable
service to all residents who reasonably request service to the extent

115.26.
   (B)   In determining which remedy or remedies are appropriate, the city must

REGULATIONS OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES
§ 116.10 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations relating to sexually oriented businesses. The provisions of this
subchapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this
subchapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials
protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and
exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither
is it the intent nor effect of this subchapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in reports made available to the
Common Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v.
Play Time Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young vs. American Mini Theaters,
426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and
on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix,
Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier,
California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the report of
the Attorney General's Working Group on the regulation of sexually oriented
businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Common Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented business defined in this
subchapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, non-A, non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and
shigella infection.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. Through December 31, 1997,
there have been 619,690 reported cases of AIDS in the United States.
      (8)   As of December 31, 1997, there have been 2,583 reported cases of
AIDS in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
      (9)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (10)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (11)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities
and maintain those facilities.
      (12)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented
films.
      (13)   The findings noted in divisions (1) through (12) raise substantial
governmental concerns.
      (14)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (15)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (16)   The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the city
will be promoted by the enactment of this subchapter.
   (C)   The harmful secondary effects which sexually oriented businesses have
on communities in which they locate include inappropriate exposure of children
and teenagers to graphic sexual images, increased incidence of crime,
diminished property values, discouragement of residential, educational,
religious, and recreational uses. The cumulative effect of the location of
sexually oriented businesses, especially in concentration, is a change in the
perceived community character and the diminishment of the quality of life or
business for other uses in the neighborhood in which the sexually oriented
businesses are located. Regulation of sexually oriented businesses is necessary
to reduce secondary harmful effects of these businesses, including, but not
limited to, the decline of community health and safety and the blighting of
surrounding neighborhoods and uses. Regulation of sexually oriented businesses
is also necessary for the integrity of residential areas, schools, churches or
other places of worship, libraries, child care centers, parks, and playgrounds,
all of which are areas in which minors congregate, a segment of the community
particularly at risk when in proximity to sexually oriented businesses.

   (H)   Access to license premises. The application for or the granting of a

law enforcement officers, or other persons designated or authorized by the
city, of all areas of any establishment requiring a license under this chapter
for the purpose of verifying compliance with the terms and conditions of this
chapter. It shall be unlawful for an applicant, licensee, owner or operator of

spirits and wine, the regulatory license fee shall be 5% of gross sales. The
regulatory license fee shall be 5% on gross retail sales of package malt
beverages. These regulatory license fees may be addressed and modified each
fiscal year when the city adopts its annual budget and such annual rate for the

reimbursement to the city for the cost of any additional policing, regulatory,
or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the
city. Should the city not address the regulatory' license fee in any given
budget, then the regulatory license fee shall remain at the level at which it
was last fixed in this ABC Ordinance until such time as the City Council shall
adjust the fee.
      (2)   Payment of said regulatory fee shall be remitted to the City ABC
Administrator, who shall transmit all fees to the City Clerk, or his designee,
for deposit into the appropriate designated account. The city may use said fees
as permitted by law, including but not limited to, any cost of additional
policing, regulatory or administrative expenses related to the sale of
alcoholic beverages in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in
addition to any other fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit
against a regulatory license fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount
equal to any license fee paid by licensee and shall be based on paperwork
required by the local and/or state ABC Administrator, which may include but is
not limited to tax returns and financial statements. Said paperwork and payment
will be due according to the schedule set forth by the Mayor, or his designee,
which may be set at, but is not limited to. time periods consisting of a
monthly or quarterly billing by the local ABC office and/or the city.
      (3)   Failure to pay such remittance within ten days of the due date
constitutes a violation and shall subject a licensee to suspension or
revocation.

date is 5% of the regulatory fee for each 90 days or fraction thereof. The
total late filing penalty shall not exceed 25% of the regulatory fee; provided,
however, that in no case shall the penalty be less than $10.

payments.

City ABC Administrator. Applications for the issuance of new licenses and for
renewals of existing licenses shall be in writing and upon the forms provided
by the Kentucky ABC Board and/or the city, both of which may be amended and
supplemented from time to time by each respective agency.
      (2)   The application shall be verified and shall set forth in detail
such information concerning the applicant and the premises for which the
license is sought, as required by the Kentucky Revised Statutes, the state ABC
Board, and the city, including as follows:
         (a)   Name and address;
         (b)   Nature of interest;
         (c)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         (d)   Date of birth;
         (e)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of
Kentucky;
         (f)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license
or LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license under this chapter;
         (g)   Extent of stock or company ownership; and
         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or LLC,
corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license in
any other state or province.
      (3)   Each application shall be accompanied by a certified check, cashier
check, or money order for the amount of the license fee, less the $50
application fee.
      (4)   In addition to the above specified information, the applicant shall
file with the application responses to any additional questions as may be posed
or prescribed by the City ABC Administrator. The City Council has adopted a
statement of guidelines and priorities for the issuance of licenses within this
chapter to determine the extent to which applications may further, or impede,
the objectives of those guidelines. Therefore, in addition to the information
contained in the application, the City ABC Administrator may require such other
information as the Administrator may, in his or her discretion, deem desirable,
reasonable, or appropriate to the consideration of the application.
   (D)   Other Conditions. In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or
considerations required or permitted by law:
      (1)   The City ABC Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage
license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his or her
place of business shall have been approved by a licensed building inspector,
and any and all other inspections required by the Kentucky Building Code or
other applicable law;
      (2)   All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal background
check and shall sign a waiver allowing the release of this information to the
City ABC Administrator; and
      (3)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be granted or
renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any property taxes,
both real and personal, any other taxes due to the city, fees of any type, or
charges due to any department of the city at the time of issuing the license,
nor may any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or
property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any of the
above delinquent payments due and owing to the city. Further, if a licensee
becomes delinquent in the payment of any of the above at any time during the
license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be subject
to revocation or suspension.
      (4)   No person, whether applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in
any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the City
ABC Administrator, or any member of the city's staff, or any state ABC
Administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This provision is not intended to stifle expressions of
opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law,
both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or state ABC
Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a
license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for
appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this
chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit monetary
settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order
or revocation or suspension, where the ordinance and applicable statutes allow
for such payments in settlement.
   (E)   Form of license. All city licenses shall be in such form as may be
provided by the ABC Administrator, but at the least shall contain:
      (1)   The name and address of the licensee;
      (2)   The number of the license;
      (3)   The type of license;
      (4)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the licensed
premises;
      (5)   The name and address of the owner of the building in which the
licensed premises are located;
      (6)   The expiration date of the license; and
      (7)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a property
or vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to law.
   (F)   Change of information.
      (1)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been
issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall
be filed with the City ABC Administrator within ten days of the change.
      (2)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of
corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership
changes in such organizations be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The
City ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the
ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that
person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic
beverage license.
      (3)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation. LLC or other
business organization herein, the word "change" is construed to include any
change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the
corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures 10% of
the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than 10% of the total
ownership or stock shall require a new license.
      (4)   The following information shall be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
         (a)   Name and address;
         (b)   Nature of interest;
         (c)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         (d)   Date of birth;
         (e)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of
Kentucky (If a Glasgow resident, indicate when residence was established);
         (f)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license
or in any LLC. corporation, partnership or other business organization holding
a license under this act;
         (g)   Extent of stock or company ownership; and
         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in
any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license in any other state or province.
      (5)   This information shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator as
a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten days of any change of required
information.
   (G)   Renewal of license.
      (1)   Every year, except in the case of the temporary licenses, each
licensee shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the
City ABC Administrator no less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the
license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except
where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises
licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act
of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the
premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private
organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew
exiting lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less than 20 days from the expiration date of the license, setting
forth these facts, and the City ABC Administrator is hereby authorized to
extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a reasonable length
of time within the sound discretion of the City ABC Administrator; provided,
however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from the expiration date of the
former license or licenses. Said license fee shall not be payable until
application is made for the transfer of said license to a new location.
      (2)   The renewal by the City ABC Administrator of the license shall not
be construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior
to such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the
licensee.
      (3)   Any other provisions contained herein notwithstanding, a licensee
who elects to renew his or her licenses by batch at the same time, shall do so
in conformity with the applicable Kentucky Administrative Regulation.
   (H)   Lost or destroyed license. When a license shall be lost or destroyed
without fault on the part of the licensee or his or her agent or employee, a
duplicate in lieu of the original license shall be issued by the City ABC
Administrator after the Administrator shall have been satisfied as to the
facts; provided, however, that the applicant for said duplicate license shall
pay a fee of $10 for the duplicate license.
   (I)   Revocation or suspension.
      (1)   Any license may be revoked or suspended by the City ABC
Administrator if the licensee shall have violated any of other provisions of
KRS Chapters 241 thru 244, or any rule or regulation of the ABC Board, or of
the Kentucky Department of Revenue, relating to the regulation of the
manufacture, sale, and transportation, or taxation, of alcoholic beverages or
if such licensee shall have violated or shall violate any act of Congress or
any rule or regulation of any federal board, agency or commission, or this
chapter now, heretofore, or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of
the manufacture, sale, and transportation, or taxation, of intoxicating
liquors, or any rules or regulations of the city heretofore in existence or
authorized by the terms of KRS Chapters 241 through 244 to be created,
irrespective of whether the licensee knew of or permitted the violation or
whether the violation was committed in disobedience of his or her instructions,
or any such license may be revoked or suspended for any cause which the City
ABC Administrator in the exercise of his or her sound discretion deems
sufficient.
      (2)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the City
ABC Administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had
been known.
      (3)   In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be
revoked or suspended for the following causes:
         (a)   Conviction of the licensee or his or her agent or employee for
selling any illegal beverages on the premises licensed.
         (b)   Making any false, material statements in an application for a
license.
         (c)   If within a period of two consecutive years, any licensee or any
clerk, servant, agent or employee of the licensee shall have been convicted of
two violations of the terms and provisions of KRS Chapters 241 through 244 or
any act heretofore or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the
manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages or if within such
period, any licensee or any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the license
shall have twice been convicted of any felony or of any misdemeanor directly or
indirectly attributable to the use of alcoholic beverages, or of one such
felony and one such misdemeanor.
         (d)   Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee to pay
an excise tax or any part thereof, or any penalties imposed by or under the
provisions of any statutes, this chapter, or acts of Congress relative to
taxation or for a violation of any rules or regulations of the Kentucky
Department of Revenue made in pursuance thereof.
         (e)   Setting up, conducting, operating or keeping, on the licensed
premises, any gambling game, device, machine or contrivance, or lottery or gift
enterprise, or handbook or facility for betting or transmitting bets on horse
races; or permitting to be set up, conducted, operated, kept, or engaged in, on
the licensed premises, any such game, device, machine, contrivance, lottery,
gift enterprise, handbook or facility.
   (J)   Proceedings for revocation or suspension of license.
      (1)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of
any law enforcement officer, or of the City ABC Administrator, the City ABC
Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license
granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after
the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered
mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such
proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in
opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or
in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed.
      (2)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall be those set out in the Kentucky Administrative
Procedure Act (KAR Chapter 13B).
      (3)   A decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or suspending a
license may be appealed as provided in KRS 243.550.
      (4)   Within three days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the City ABC Administrator. If the revoked or
suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of
Police, at the request of the City ABC Administrator, shall immediately cause
one of his or her officers to take physical possession of the license and
return it to the City ABC Administrator.
      (5)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee
may, with prior approval of the City ABC Administrator, dispose of and transfer
his or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
      (6)   Appeal from the decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or
suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing of an appeal
shall stay further proceedings for revocation.
      (7)   If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the City ABC
Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at once
suspend all operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the entry of a
final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on
appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under this
license.
   (K)   Transfer or assignment. No license issued under this chapter shall be
transferred or assigned either as to licensee or location except with prior
approval of the City ABC Administrator and not then until a payment of $100
shall be made to the City ABC Administrator.
   (L)   Refusal of license; guidelines for approval of quota licenses.
      (1)   The City ABC Administrator may refuse to issue a license for any of
the following reasons:
         (a)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for
suspension or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for
state licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as
violation of any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or
the administration thereof;
         (b)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of
license would be authorized under local, state, or federal law; or
         (c)   If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or
her application.
      (2)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the City ABC
Administrator may appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KRS 241.200.
   (M)   Review of license; books, records and reports.
      (1)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter
shall provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions
of any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a
minimum percentage of the applicants business income is earned from the sale of
food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated with
the applicants quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide the
form schedule to the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to
manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the
filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly
report shall identity each catered event by type of event, date and address of
the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of
food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for
filing of reports notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the
premises of any licensee and examine the books and records to determine whether
the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this chapter. In the event the
conditions of any license requirement are not met during any particular
quarter, the City ABC Administrator shall have discretion in determining
whether revocation is appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a
reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is
demonstrated by the licensee, the City ABC Administrator may apply an
accounting period of at least one year in determining whether or not the food
sale percentage requirement has been met.
      (2)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain, upon the
licensed premises, adequate books and records of all transactions involved in
the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the City ABC Administrator and such city
employees who may assist the City ABC Administrator in his or her review.
      (3)   For the purpose of assisting the City ABC Administrator in
enforcement of this chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC Board
under KRS 243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the City ABC
Administrator. Copies of any and all reports and correspondences to the ABC
Board required by statute shall be furnished to the City ABC Administrator.
   (N)   Dormancy.
      (1)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after 90 days. Such is the intent of this section.
Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her business
interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various exceptions to
the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
      (2)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period
of 90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in
division (N)(3) below are proved to the satisfaction of the City ABC
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the City
ABC Administrator.
      (3)   The provisions of division (N)(2) above shall not apply to any
licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a
license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing
lease. Prior to the expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall
furnish to the City ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the
fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the
specific reasons set forth herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an
extension of the dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect
during the license period or until same is transferred to another premises,
notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted during said period;
provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid unless business is
conducted thereunder within 12 months from the date of notice to the City ABC
Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of
his or her sound discretion.

drive-through outlet. This prohibition shall not apply to a drive-up window at

including retail beer, where the primary sales area is arranged for and
utilized by persons entering the premises on foot and manually carrying out the

may file a notice of appeal from a decision or order of the Building Inspector.
This notice shall be in writing and filed within ten days after the decision or
order of the Building Inspector has been made.

§ 152.16 REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TIMING OF DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.
   (A)   Approval of development plan and soil erosion control before
disturbance of natural ground cover.
      (1)   (a)   For any case where the subject property is one acre or more
in area, no grading, stripping, excavation, filling or other disturbance of the
natural ground cover shall take place before the Joint City-County Planning
Commission has approved a development plan (preliminary or final as
appropriate).
         (b)   In any case where a single-family dwelling unit is proposed on
one or more acres of disturbed ground, grading and erosion control plans are
required to be housed in the office of the Joint City-County Planning
Commission. However, formal approval of the Joint City-County Planning
Commission is not required.
      (2)   In any case where the subject property is less than one acre, but
more than 10,000 square feet in area or increase the impervious area by more

required), but before the Joint City-County Planning Commission has approved a
final development plan and, if applicable, a preliminary subdivision plat.
Detailed engineering requirements for streets and other public facilities may
necessitate additional changes to site topography beyond those already made by
the developer.
   (C)   Approval of development plan before building permit. For any case
where a development plan is required by this subchapter, no building permits
shall be issued until a final development plan is approved by the Joint City-
County Planning Commission and a copy of that plan is certified to the Building

development plan shall limit and control the issuance of all building and
occupancy permits and restrict the construction, location and use of all land
and structures to the conditions as set forth in the plan.
   (D)   Payment of cost of special meeting of Planning and Zoning Commission.
If approval of a development plan requires a special meeting of the Joint City-
County Planning Commission, held at the request of the applicant, the cost of
the meeting shall be paid by the applicant.
   (E)   Temporary, limited purpose building permit. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this subchapter, the Building Inspector is authorized to issue a
temporary, limited purpose building permit, valid for a period of 30 days,
which may not be renewed or extended, under the following conditions:
      (1)   The area to which the temporary, limited permit applies must be
zoned for industrial purposes at the time, and the purpose of issuance must be
to facilitate the current construction of an industrial facility;
      (2)   A meeting be held with the city’s planning staff, Building
Inspector and the Superintendent of Public Works and all parties must have
reviewed the preliminary plans (including grading, drainage, site layout,
parking configuration and erosion control measures to be implemented) for site
improvement, and have determined that no significant flood, drainage,
topographic or other similar problems will be occasioned by permitting site
improvement work to proceed prior to the submission and approval of preliminary
and final development plans;
      (3)   The grant of a temporary, limited purpose permit shall not in any
way exempt the developer from the requirements of submitting preliminary and
final development plans, as required by ordinance, and modifying any work done
under the temporary permit to conform to the final requirements of the approved
development plan;
      (4)   The temporary, limited purpose permit limits the developer to site
work only, which does not entail building construction, finalized entrances or
street networks, finalized grading or landscaping; and
      (5)   The strict conformance to the temporary, limited purpose building
permit guidelines does not relinquish the developer from adhering to any and
all regulations in the Development Ordinance, zoning ordinance, subdivision
regulations, BMP Manual or any findings of the Joint City-County Planning
Commission when preliminary and final plans are presented to them.

1993; Am. Ord. 2026, passed 8-23-1993; Am. Ord. 2667, passed 7-13-2009; Am.
Ord. 2801, passed 10-22-2012)
§ 152.17 WHERE REQUIRED.
   Development plans shall be required as follows.
   (A)   Development plans are encouraged and may be required for all zoning
map amendments or approval of a subdivision plat. If the proposed zoning is not
in compliance with the approved Comprehensive Plan or further explanation and
details about the proposed use are needed in order for the Joint City-County
Planning Commission to make an informed decision on the proposed zone change, a
detailed development plan and any additional details deemed necessary by the
Planning Commission will be required. All applications for zoning map
amendments and approval of subdivision plats that meet the aforementioned
criteria shall require the submission and approval of both a preliminary
development plan and a final development plan prior to development of the
property.
   (B)   Preliminary development plan may be waived under certain conditions.
If recommended by the planning staff of the city, the Planning Commission may
waive the filing and approval of a development plan in connection with a zoning
proposal, if the Planning Commission finds that development of the subject
property would neither involve nor create significant flood, drainage, sewage,
traffic, topographic or other similar problems; provided, however, if the city
planning staff, the Superintendent of the Street and Sanitation Department, the
Manager of the City Water and Sewer Commission and the Superintendent of the
city’s Electric Plant Board all concur that no significant problems related to
flood, drainage, sewage, traffic, topographic or other similar problems are
presented or created affecting the subject property or other property in the
area in connection with a proposed zoning map amendment for which no present
development is proposed for the property, then no preliminary development plan
shall be required for a zoning map amendment.
   (C)   Development plans are required by the zoning ordinance to permit more
than one principal structure and its accessory structures on a lot or parcel of
land and shall be submitted to the Joint City-County Planning Commission, in
accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.
   (D)   (1)   Development plans required for multi-business structures.
      (2)   Development plans are required by the zoning code to permit
construction of multi-business structures and shall be submitted to the Joint
City-County Planning Commission, in accordance with the provisions of this
subchapter.
   (E)   Development plans required whenever building permit issued. A
development plan shall be required to accompany any building permit application
filed to construct a building on property zoned anything other than
residential; provided, however, the city Building Inspector may issue a
building permit without approval of the Joint City-County Planning and Zoning
Commission if the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   If and only if the parcel on which the building is to be
constructed contains one acre or less, in which case a grading plan with
proposed erosion control plans will be required in accordance with §
152.16(A)(2);
      (2)   A plan has been submitted and reviewed by the city’s Building
Inspector, the Superintendent of the Street and Sanitation Department, the
manager of the city’s Electric Plant Board, the Manager of the city’s Water and
Sewer Commission and Fire Chief of the city’s Fire Department; and
      (3)   Each certifies that there are not existing or potential substantial
flood, drainage, sewage, traffic, topographic or other similar problems
relating to the development of the subject property that could have an adverse
influence on existing or future development of the subject property or other
property in the neighborhood.
   (F)   Borrow/back fill sites are classified as any site over 10,000 square
feet where fill material is either being excavated or deposited with no
intention of any immediate site development improvements to the site. Approval
of any such site shall be at the discretion of the Planning Commission Staff,
city Building Inspector and the Superintendent of Public Works and must adhere
to the following:
      (1)   Borrow/back fill sites are only allowed in commercial and
industrial zones; and
      (2)   Plans be submitted to the aforementioned city officials which
include existing topography, final grading, erosion control measures, including
measures to ensure no substances of any kind be tracked onto public roadways.
(1989 Code, § 152.17) (Ord. 1975, passed 9-28-1992; Am. Ord. 2026, passed 8-23-
1993; Am. Ord. 2667, passed 7-13-2009)
§ 152.18 DEVELOPMENT PLAN PROCEDURES.
   The procedure for Joint City-County Planning Commission consideration of any
development plan shall be as follows.
   (A)   Pre-application meeting. Prior to development plan submittal and
filing of an application, the developer, or party representing the developer,
the developer’s engineer, and the general contractor, or representative of the
general contractor, shall schedule a pre-application meeting with the Joint
City-County Planning Commission staff. The purpose of the pre-application
meeting is to allow the Joint City-County Planning Commission staff to discuss
the effect of the Comprehensive Plan, zoning ordinance, subdivision
regulations, Best Management Practices Manual and any other land development
regulations upon the proposed development. This meeting will also provide the
applicant with a general idea of the feasibility of the project before making
commitments for more extensive project planning and development with regards to
drainage, construction and sediment control measures.
   (B)   Filing. To request the Joint City-County Planning Commission official
action on the development plan, the developer shall file with the Joint City-
County Planning Commission a completed application form, filing fee and copies
of the plan as required by the terms and conditions of the Joint City-County
Planning Commission’s application form. The Joint City-County Planning
Commission staff will make the submitted copies of the plan available to all
other concerned agencies.
   (C)   Review. The Joint City-County Planning Commission staff and concerned
agencies shall review the development plan and seek a consensus on all issues.
Documentation of agency review shall be available upon request. The Joint City-
County Planning Commission staff will then forward its recommendations and
those of the concerned agencies to the Joint City-County Planning Commission.
   (D)   Joint City-County Planning Commission action.
      (1)   No development plans shall be considered for action by the Joint
City-County Planning Commission until they have been reviewed by the Joint
City-County Planning Commission staff and concerned agencies (including, but
not limited to all utilities, the Street Department, Fire Department and the
like), and recommendations have been forwarded to the Joint City-County
Planning Commission. All development plans shall be approved or disapproved
within 90 days of the date they are formally filed for Joint City-County
Planning Commission action unless the developer agrees to a longer time period.
      (2)   The Joint City-County Planning Commission will review
recommendations of the staff and concerned agencies and then act for approval,
conditional approval with the conditions noted, postponement or disapproval.
The Joint City-County Planning Commission may modify or disapprove the
development plan if it finds the plan does not comply with the requirements of
the zoning ordinance, and when applicable, the subdivision regulations; or if
it finds there are existing or potential substantial flood, drainage, sewage,
traffic, topographic or other similar problems relating to the development of
the subject property. Reasons for action of postponement or disapproval shall
be fully incorporated in the Joint City-County Planning Commission’s minutes.
The following actions by the Joint City-County Planning Commission shall have
the meaning so stated.
         (a)   Approval. The development plan is ready to be certified by the
Joint City-County Planning Commission Chair and Secretary with no further
corrections or revisions of the plan required from the developer.
         (b)   Condition approval. The development plan cannot be certified by
the Joint City-County Planning Commission Chair and Secretary until the
developer has complied with the conditions of approval set forth in the record
of the Joint City-County Planning Commission action on the plan.
         (c)   Postponement.  The Joint City-County Planning Commission has
deferred action until some future Joint City-County Planning Commission meeting
in order that certain clarification can be made in regard to the development
plan. No completely new resubmittal is required of the developer as is the case
for disapproval.
         (d)   Disapproval. The Joint City-County Planning Commission has
disapproved the plan. To request a new review and action, the developer must
file a new application along with a filing fee, plan copies and other material
as required under this subchapter.
   (E)   Certification of approval. Within six months of Joint City-County
Planning Commission approval, unless a time extension has been granted previous
to the expiration date, the following steps shall be completed or else Joint
City-County Planning Commission approval becomes null and void.
      (1)   The developer shall fully comply with any conditions of approval
placed on the plan by the Joint City-County Planning Commission and submit the
completed original tracing of the plan to the Joint City-County Planning
Commission.
      (2)   The plan shall be certified by the Joint City-County Planning
Commission Chair and Secretary if it is in conformance with all requirements.
The Joint City-County Planning Commission staff shall have copies of the plan
prepared and distributed to other public agencies at the expense of the
developer and return the original plan tracing to the developer.
      (3)   In conjunction with any request by the developer for a time
extension or re-approval of an expired plan, the Joint City-County Planning
Commission may require changes in the development plan when it finds that time
has necessitated such changes for the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the community, or when applicable ordinances and regulations have
been changed.
   (F)   Timing restrictions. The following timing restrictions shall be
applicable to development plans:
      (1)   Final development plans shall be submitted for Joint City-County
Planning Commission consideration within two years of the date of Joint City-
County Planning Commission action on a preliminary development plan, otherwise,
no further building permits shall be issued unless and until the plan is re-
approved by the Joint City-County Planning Commission.
      (2)   The developer shall be required to obtain building permits for all
structures shown on a final development plan within five years of the date of
Joint City-County Planning Commission action on the development plan,
otherwise, no further building permits shall be issued unless and until the
plan is re-approved by the Joint City-County Planning Commission.
(1989 Code, § 152.18) (Ord. 1975, passed 9-28-1992; Am. Ord. 2026, passed 8-23-
1993; Am. Ord. 2667, passed 7-13-2009)
§ 152.19 TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   There shall be a preliminary development plan and a final development plan,
defined as follows:
   (A)   Preliminary development plan. A preliminary development plan is a site
plan by which, at the early stages of development design, the Joint City-County
Planning Commission may consider, approve and restrict many major aspects of
the development without requiring an undue amount of final design work on the
part of the developer. The preliminary development plan is less detailed and
specific than a final development plan in terms of exact arrangement of
buildings, parking areas, open spaces, access points and any other site design
features. No building permits can be issued based upon a preliminary
development plan.
   (B)   Final development plan. A final development plan is a site plan from
which a building permit will be sought. A final development plan is intended to
deal with site design issues at a detailed level and to actually dictate the
approved locations of buildings, parking areas, open spaces, access points and
any other site design features.
(1989 Code, § 152.19) (Ord. 1975, passed 9-28-1992; Am. Ord. 2026, passed 8-23-
1993)
§ 152.20 CONTENT AND FORMAT OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   (A)   All development plans shall be designed with the following criteria in
regards to storm water management.
      (1)   The developer is responsible for all surface and sub-surface
drainage of the proposed development. The developer shall provide for such
drainage in a manner as to properly relieve storm waters from the development
without obstructing existing drainage patterns or increasing runoff onto
adjacent properties, including city maintained right-of-way.
      (2)   In any case where post development storm water runoff is determined
by the developer’s engineer to exceed pre-development runoff on-site detention,
either by means of drainage structures, underground detention or a detention
basin, will be required.
         (a)   All development plans and grading plans required by §
152.16(A)(2) shall have both pre-development and post-development storm water
runoff calculations clearly indicated on the plans.
         (b)   All drainage structures and facilities (pipes, culverts, drop
boxes, ditches and the like) shall be designed to accommodate 100 year rain
event.
         (c)   Detention basins shall be designed by a professional engineer
licensed in the State of Kentucky. Design calculations for detention basins
shall be provided to the Joint City-County Planning Commission.
            (1).   The detention facilities shall be of sufficient height to
provide necessary water detention. It shall consist of an inlet structure, low
flow pipe, emergency spillway and energy dissipater if required to control
discharge.
            (2).   Side slopes shall not exceed maximum slope of three foot
horizontal to one foot vertical (3:1) on the upstream side of the dam if it is
to have a grass covering or a maximum slope of two
foot horizontal to one foot vertical (2:1) if it is to be rock. The downstream
side of the dam shall have a maximum slope of three foot horizontal to one foot
vertical (3:1).
            (3).   A standard concrete headwall to disperse the water flow from
an outlet structure will be sufficient if outlet velocities do not exceed four
feet per second.
            (4).   Energy dissipaters will be required for all outlet
structures where outlet velocity exceeds four feet per second to protect the
downstream channel from eroding. Reference the adopted Best Management
Practices Manual for additional erosion control requirements regarding
detention basins.
            (5).   No overtopping of the emergency spillway is to occur and
detention facilities are to be designed in such a way as to prevent it.
            (6).   Refer to Article 1004.1 of the subdivision regulations for
additional detention basin requirements.
         (d)   In the event that pre-development and post development
calculations provided by the developer’s engineer are found to be inaccurate
any time after approval of the final development plan, the developing property
owner shall be held liable for any and all damages incurred and corrective
measures to be initiated.
         (e)   The developing property owner shall be held liable for any and
all failures of drainage structures, underground detention or detention basins
resulting from any on-site occurrences resulting from design flaws of the
development plans.
         (f)   In the event that drainage structures, underground detention or
detention basins fail due to improper installation, the developing property
owner shall be held liable for any and all damages incurred and corrective
measures to be initiated.
         (g)   In the event that any drainage structure or facility fails, the
city shall not be held responsible for any damages to adjacent properties
relating to the site at which the drainage structure or facility fails.
         (h)   Refer to Article 1004.2 of the subdivision regulations for
specifications regarding drainage ditch design.
         (i)   A means of access (easement or access ways) shall be provided to
all proposed storm water facilities for maintenance. Any and all easements to
be maintained (mowed, cleared of debris, standard up-keep) by the current
property owner.
         (j)   Maintenance (mowing, clearing of debris, standard up-keep) of
drainage structures or facilities is the sole responsibility of the current
property owners. However, in any case where events such as those mentioned in §
152.20(A)(2)(d), (e) and (f) occur, the developing property owner shall be held
liable for any corrective actions.
         (k)   If downstream or bordering drainage facilities on off-site
properties are found to be inadequate due to onside drainage improvements off-
site improvements may be required.
         (l)   Strict conformance to these regulations does not relinquish the
developer/property owner from liability concerning any damages to adjacent
property owners, including city maintained right-of-way that may occur.
         (m)   In the event that the Joint City-County Planning Commission or
the Superintendent of the Street Department present logical findings for not
having detention (soil conditions, excessive slopes and the like), the runoff
detention requirement may be waived.
   (B)   All development plans shall be prepared on Mylar or other material
capable of clear reproduction using Ozalid print process. Plans shall be
legible and of a size and scale (generally not exceeding one inch = 100 feet)
which enables clear presentation of required information.
   (C)   Required plan information shall be as follows:
      (1)   Contents of preliminary development plan. A preliminary development
plan shall contain the following information at a minimum:

(1989 Code, § 152.20) (Ord. 1975, passed 9-28-1992; Am. Ord. 2026, passed 8-23-
1993; Am. Ord. 2667, passed 7-13-2009)
§ 152.21 AMENDMENTS TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   (A)   Amendments to approved development plans can be made only by official
Joint City-County Planning Commission action in a public hearing. Contents,
format and procedures shall be as for the original submission.
   (B)   However, amendments which fully meet the requirements set forth
hereinafter for minor amendments may be approved and certified by the Joint
City-County Planning Commission’s designated agent without further action by
the Joint City-County Planning Commission.
      (1)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      MINOR AMENDMENTS. To expedite approval in those situations where
amendments are of minor significance and generally relate to the shifting of
previously approved spaces. The amendments:
            (1).   May be approved by the Planning Commission Director where
the amendments are not inconsistent with the adopted binding elements for the
general development plan and where the cumulative effect of the amendments
results in less than a 10% variation in gross floor area and/or less than 5% of
the total yard area provided in the adopted final development plan;
            (2).   Would eliminate, alter or add adopted binding elements or
which exceed the maximum variations which may be approved by the Planning
Director under division (B)(1)(a) of this section, shall be approved by the
Planning Commission only after a public hearing, properly held in the same
manner as for the original approval of the general development plan;
            (3).   Shall not change the location or cross section of any street
and shall not increase the number or change the location of street access
points on arterial or high traffic collector streets; and
            (4).   May include a reduction in parking spaces only when an
associated reduction in floor area or number of dwelling units would permit a
lesser number of minimum required off-street parking spaces than required for
the original development plan. To qualify as a minor amendment, this reduction
may be equal to but not exceed the difference in minimum required parking
between the original plan and the proposed minor amended plan. For any case,
where parking in excess of the minimum requirement was provided on the original
development plan, that same number of spaces shall be provided in excess of the
minimum requirement for the proposed minor amendment plan.
      (2)   Procedure for minor amendments.
         (a)   Filing. To request approval of minor amendments to development
plans, the developer shall file with the Joint City-County Planning Commission
a completed application form, filing fee and copies of the plan as required by
the terms and conditions of the Joint City-County Planning Commission’s
application form. The Joint City-County Planning Commission staff will make the
submitted copies of the plan available to all other concerned agencies.
         (b)   Review. Joint City-County Planning Commission staff shall review
the plan for compliance with all applicable requirements and ordinances and
shall consult with concerned agencies as appropriate to assure proper plan
review. Upon determination that all requirements have been met, the Joint City-
County Planning Commission or its authorized agent shall certify the plan as
approved. If any question arises as to compliance, however, the plan shall be
referred to the Joint City-County Planning Commission for action.
         (c)   Certification. Upon certification of approval by the Joint City-
County Planning Commission or its agent, Joint City-County Planning Commission
staff shall have copies of the plan prepared and distributed to other public
agencies at the expense of the developer and return the original plan tracing
to the developer.
      (3)   Content and format of minor amendments. Minor amendments shall have
the same content and format requirements as the original development plan,
except that:
         (a)   The title shall indicate the plan is a minor amendment;
         (b)   A note shall be added listing the exact nature of the requested
changes; and
         (c)   The following will be the required language for certification by
the authorized agent of the Joint City-County Planning Commission: “I do hereby
certify that this development plan amendment complies with Zoning ordinance
provisions regarding amendments to development plans.”
(1989 Code, § 152.21) (Ord. 1975, passed 9-28-1992; Am. Ord. 2026, passed 8-23-
1993)
§ 152.22 RELATIONSHIP TO SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS.
   The relationships between development plans and the subdivision regulations
are established as follows:
   (A)   Applicability of subdivision regulations. Although development plans
are not subdivision plats, quite often the development plan does indicate a
need or intent to subdivide property. For any such development plan, the design
and improvement standards contained within the subdivision regulations shall be
applied to proposals contained on the development plan.
   (B)   Development plans required by the subdivision regulations. Development
plans required by the subdivision regulations are required to conform with the
provisions of this subchapter.
   (C)   Plats; substitutions. Preliminary or final subdivision plat may be
substituted for development plans required in conjunction with map amendment
requests. It is recognized that in certain cases a preliminary or final
subdivision plat would be as appropriate or more appropriate to be considered
in conjunction with a map amendment request than would a development plan.
Generally, the situations involve developments where placement of structures
will be tightly controlled by the streets, lot pattern and requirements for
placement of structures within the zone and where the developer sees fit to
have plans prepared at the required level of detail for subdivision plats prior
to receiving a zone change approval. When a developer is required at the
discretion of the Joint City-County Planning Commission to provide a
development plan in conjunction with a zoning map amendment request, the
developer may file a subdivision plat in place of the development plan, if
deemed appropriate by the Joint City-County Planning Commission and Joint City-
County Planning Commission staff. In any disputed case, the Joint City-County
Planning Commission shall be the final judge as to whether a development plan
or a subdivision plat is required. Development plans required by this
subchapter for zoning change requests, all zoning map amendments or approval of
a subdivision plat may be combined with subdivision plats where appropriate,
but such a development plan shall not be replaced by a subdivision plat alone.
(1989 Code, § 152.22) (Ord. 1975, passed 9-28-1992; Am. Ord. 2026, passed 8-23-
1993; Am. Ord. 2667, passed 7-13-2009)
§ 152.23 APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS.
   This subchapter and the requirements thereof shall not apply to any
applications for zoning map amendment, approval of subdivision plats or
building permit applications filed on or before November 25, 1991; it shall
apply to all filings after November 25, 1991.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS 82.082 delegated
to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry
Therefore, the City Council of Glasgow, Kentucky, hereby adopts this chapter as
its floodplain management ordinance.
(1989 Code, § 155.01) (Ord. 2087, passed 1-9-1995; Am. Ord. 2743, passed 4-25-
2011)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Glasgow are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(1989 Code, § 155.02) (Ord. 2087, passed 1-9-1995; Am. Ord. 2743, passed 4-25-
2011)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(1989 Code, § 155.03) (Ord. 2087, passed 1-9-1995; Am. Ord. 2743, passed 4-25-
2011)
§ 153.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at die expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
special flood hazard area.
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(1989 Code, § 155.04) (Ord. 2087, passed 1-9-1995; Am. Ord. 2743, passed 4-25-

   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snow melt, or a
combination of both. In A ZONES, flood waters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   A1-30 AND AE ZONES. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   A99 ZONE. That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations arc  determined.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.

(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three

Map (FIRM) for zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and AR/
AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a
1% or greater chance of being equated or exceeded in any given year,
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade
facility or infrastructure. See definition for STRUCTURE.

of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows). See MUDSLIDES.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See FLOOD-
RELATED EROSION.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special

   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components arc capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as the REGULATORY FLOODWAY.

regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. FREEBOARD must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, and the like.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
153.28, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100
years Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY. A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or

shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that
is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The HAZARD POTENTIAL classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;

states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).
      (1)   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE coverage provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws
or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by
a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state
or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged,
ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish,
or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.
   KRS 151.250 - PLANS FOR DAMS, LEVEES, ETC. TO BE APPROVED AND PERMIT ISSUED
BY CABINET - (ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC PROTECTION CABINET).
      (1)   (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no
city, county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee
districts, drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar
bodies, shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or
improvement of any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other
obstruction, except those constructed by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet,
in the floodplain or floodway of any stream, unless the plans and
specifications for such work have been:
         (a)   Submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement; and
         (b)   Approved in writing by the Cabinet and a permit issued.
         However, the Cabinet by administrative regulation may exempt those
dams, embankments or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as
to require approval by the Cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of
water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the
state shall commence the filling of, or place a building, barrier, or
obstruction of any sort in, any area in the floodplain or floodway, unless
plans and specifications for such work have been submitted to and approved by
the Cabinet and a permit issued as required in division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this definition is intended to give the Cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system
established for agricultural purposes. However, the Cabinet may require
approval prior to construction of structures, dams, embankments, levees,
bridges, fill, or other construction related to agricultural operations that
impact the base flood of a stream.
      (4)   The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall
lave exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of
dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across
or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are
permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal-mining operations.

not located in a SFHA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION - FILL (LOMR F). A determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above
the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA.
   LEVEE. A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment designed and
constructed m accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM.
      (1)   A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
      (2)   For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be
met:
         (a)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage,
whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially
adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the
operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised).
         (b)   All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or
state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a
community participating in the NFIP.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material void
of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support or
basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of
construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or
landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or
properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure’s foundation
system.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a structure’s LOWEST FLOOR, provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required utilities, The
term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable
structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to
be improved property. The term MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a

(FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter
suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.
(The letter “A” is not used by FEMA; the letter “B” is the first revision.)
   MARKET VALUE. The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or
adjusted assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL). The average height of the sea for all stages of the
tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used
as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as
shown on a community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is
synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold; to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of
disaster response and recovery.
   MUDSLIDE (I.E., MUDFLOW). A condition where there is a river, flow, or
inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
MUDSLIDE (I.E., MUDFLOW) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator
only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage
that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (I.E., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT. The operation of and overall
program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.

of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRMs. Refer to
FIRM legend panel for correct datum.)

on or after the effective date of Glasgow’s floodplain management regulations
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of Glasgow’s adopted floodplain management ordinances.
   NON-RESIDENTIAL. Structures that are not designed for human habitation,
including but is not limited to: small business concerns, churches, schools,
farm structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses,
recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial
structures, warehouses, and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less
than six months duration.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD). As corrected in 1988, a vertical
control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the
floodplain. (Generally used on the newer FIRMs and Digitally Referenced FIRMs
(DFIRMs). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM legend panel for correct datum.)
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment,
levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge,
conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in. along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or
collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.

§ 153.26 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
153.07. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be
processed. Specifically, the following information is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation to relation to mean sea level to which any non-
essential structure will be floodproofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential floodproofed structure will meet
the floodproofing criteria in §§
153.41(B) and
153.43(B);
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development;
      (5)   Where a building permit a requested within a designated flood zone
according to the adopted FIRM maps, a plot plan with a certificate of elevation
one foot above base flood elevation shall be required prior to construction.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder’s
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and
floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions.
         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
153.28(C)(6);
         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with §
153.07, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably

§ 153.28 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature of variance.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature, A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements of this chapter are quite rare.
The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be
met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that
must be met before a variance can be property granted. The criteria are
designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a
variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The City Council of Glasgow
shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of members of the Board of Building
and Housing Appeals.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local District Court, as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes.
   (D)   Appeal variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum accessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in §
153.05 under “public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization of the
public (as defined in §
153.05) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of division (D)(1)
through (11) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Glasgow Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

provided, as set forth in §
153.07, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction.
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, mechanical equipment and ductwork elevated no lower than one foot
above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used
to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of
division (C) below.
         (a)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified.
         (b)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use
of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title
401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states
as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: The
applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and
thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA
maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths
foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent
significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of
the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire
base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by
the Cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not
occur, the Cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site
elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory
floodway boundary calculations.
         (c)   In all other zones, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) above or together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment,
and ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
elevation; or
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
153.26(A)(3).
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division (D) below.
      (6)   All new obstruction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed
areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to
flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an elevation
one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood water. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin
1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less

coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood water.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or

by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
153.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply.
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If division (E)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
153.40 through

where base flood dm has been provided without floodways, the following
provisions apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be
located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be
elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with §
153.07.

   (A)   The city will replace all occupied and vacant occupiable low/moderate
income dwelling units demolished or converted to a use other than low/moderate
income housing as a direct result of activities assisted with funds provided
under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, as
described in 24 C.F.R. § 570.488a(c)(1).
   (B)   All replacement housing will be provided within three years of the
commencement of the demolition or rehabilitation relating to conversion. Before
obligating or expending funds that will directly result in such demolition or
conversion, the city will make public and submit to the Department of Local
Government the following information in writing:
      (1)   A description of the proposed assisted activity;
      (2)   The general location on a map and approximate number of dwelling
units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be demolished or converted to a
use other than as low/moderate income dwelling units as a direct result of the
assisted activity;
      (3)   A time schedule for the commencement and completion of the
demolition or conversion;
      (4)   The general location on a map and approximate number of dwelling
units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be provided as replacement
dwelling units;
      (5)   The source of funding and a time schedule for the provision of
replacement dwelling units; and
      (6)   The basis for concluding that each replacement dwelling unit will
remain a low/moderate income dwelling unit for at least ten years from the date
of initial occupancy.
   (C)   The City of Glasgow will provide relocation assistance, as described
in 24 C.F.R. 570.488a(c)(1) to each low/moderate income household displaced by
the demolition of housing or by the conversion of a low/moderate income
dwelling to another use as a direct result of assisted activities.
   (D)   Consistent with the goals and objectives of activities assisted under
the Act, the city will take the following steps to minimize the displacement of
persons from their home:
   “The City of Glasgow will seek to undertake projects that will not create
the displacement of persons from their homes. When the displacement of persons
cannot be avoided, the project will be designed to minimize the number of the
affected parties and will follow all requirements to mitigate the effect upon
those impacted.”

cuttings at or above existing ground level and logging operations leaving the
stump, ground cover and root mat intact;
   (B)   Installation of lateral sewer lines, telephone lines, water lines,
electric lines, gas lines or other public service facilities;
   (C)   Excavations for cemeteries for human or animal burial; and
   (D)   Grading as a maintenance measure or for landscaping purposes on
existing developed lots or parcels, provided:

not exceed 10,000 square feet, and is not within a natural drainage way (i.e.
designated flood plain);
      (2)   Proper vegetative cover is re-established as soon as possible on
all disturbed areas; and
      (3)   No significant erosion and sediment problems result from grading of
the natural ground cover.
(Ord. 2424, passed 6-25-2002)
§ 156.05 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   (A)   (1)   The Site Construction Best Management Practices Manual, a
specimen copy of which is located at the City Clerk’s office, shall be, and
hereby is, approved and adopted in all respects in order to provide guidance on
best management practices selection, design, and implementation to plan
submitters, reviewers, construction site operators, and site inspectors.
      (2)   Should any development, having storm water run-off issues, fail in
any respect to comply with the Manual, with the Mayor’s written approval,
either the Street Department or the Joint City- County Planning and Zoning
Commission shall have the authority to issue a stop-work order requiring the
developer, or anyone with a business relationship with the developer, to
immediately cease and desist further work on the project until there is full
compliance with the Manual, at which time a written directive shall be issued
authorizing the work to begin again.
   (B)   Dust control shall be utilized in association with all earth moving
and site grading activities and in areas with frequent construction traffic.
   (C)   A stabilized construction entrance shall be constructed wherever
vehicles are leaving a construction site to enter a public road or at any
unpaved entrance/exit location where there is a risk of transporting mud or
sediment on paved roads. The developer shall remove all loose soil, mud or
sediment from any public road at the end of each days work.
   (D)   The following best management practices shall be used to achieve soil
stabilization:
      (1)   Mulch. Areas requiring stabilization during December through
February shall receive only mulch (hay, straw or other natural fiber) spread
for a 75% or greater ground coverage. Mulching shall be used whenever permanent
or temporary seeding is used.
      (2)   Temporary seeding. Temporary seeding shall be used for soil
stabilization when grades are not ready for permanent seeding, except during
December through February. Only rye grain or annual rye grass seed shall be
used for temporary seeding.
      (3)   Permanent seeding.
         (a)   Permanent seeding shall be applied within 14 days after final
grade has been reached, except December through February.
         (b)   Permanent seeding shall also be applied on any areas that will
not be disturbed again for a year, even if final grades have not been reached.
(Ord. 2424, passed 6-25-2002; Am. Ord. 2548, passed 2-13-2006)
§ 156.06 CONTROL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The natural ground cover shall not be disturbed until proper on-site
erosion and sediment control best management practices are implemented.
   (B)   (1)   Where a development plan is not required by any applicable
zoning ordinance or subdivision regulation, soil stabilization, as described in
§
156.05(D), shall be required for all disturbed areas where the natural ground
cover has been graded and inactive for 14 days.
      (2)   Where a development plan is required by any applicable zoning
ordinance or subdivision regulation permanent soil stabilization, as described
in §
156.05(D), shall be required for all graded areas 14 days after final grade is
reached.
   (C)   On any property on which grading or other disturbance of the natural
ground surface has been performed pursuant to this chapter, the owner or the
owner’s agent shall, at a minimum, daily inspect and maintain all erosion and
sediment control devices or other protective devices, plantings and ground
cover installed while construction is active. After construction is complete,
the owner or the owner’s agent shall continue to regularly inspect and maintain
all erosion and sediment control devices and any soil stabilization measures
until adequate turf cover is established to prevent soil erosion and
sedimentation.
   (D)   The Building Inspector, Code Enforcement Officer or any city official
charged with the enforcement of this chapter may periodically visit any
disturbed area where the natural ground cover has been graded to inspect the
effectiveness of the soil erosion and sediment control measures. The
enforcement official may, at any point, make recommendations to improve
measures.
(Ord. 2424, passed 6-25-2002)
§ 156.07 LIABILITY OF CITY.
   (A)   Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to be nor shall be

first obtaining express permission from the Code Enforcement Officer, shall be
permitted to place an auction sign within the city’s right-of-way, so long as
the sign is removed within 24 hours of the conclusion of the auction sale. This
exception shall not apply to any other rights-of-way but city rights-of-way.
   (E)   No sign shall be erected or placed in such a fashion or in such a
location as to obstruct the flow or view of traffic.
   (F)   Special events signs shall be removed within five calendar days from
the final day of the event and all special events signs shall contain the event
date on the sign itself.

placed in any residential zone, with the exception of real estate signs
advertising the sale, rental or lease, and signs relating to home occupations,
which are governed by §
158.078, or signs for permanent identification for the dwelling (i.e., house
number).
   (H)   All signs as defined herein shall be kept and maintained in a good
state of repair.
   (I)   With the exception of billboards, which may only be erected adjacent
to the rights-of-way of U.S. Highway 31-E, Kentucky Highway 68-80, Kentucky
Highway 90, and the Cumberland Parkway pursuant to §§
111.20 et seq. of the City of Glasgow Code of Ordinances, all signs, as defined
herein, shall not exceed six feet in height and ten feet in width, inclusive of
all mounting apparatus, unless another ordinance, relating to a specific
application or circumstance, provides otherwise.
   (J)   So long as it complies with all other provisions of this section, and
so long as it is constructed and placed with the express permission of the
property owner, a permanent, off-premises, free standing, directional sign or
outdoor advertising display relating to a business, or grouping of businesses,
whose offices, stores or facilities are at another location, may be larger than
the dimensions set forth in division (G) above, but shall not exceed 12 feet in
height and 20 feet in width and shall comply with all other applicable planning
and zoning regulations. All permanent, off-premises, free-standing, directional
signs or outdoor advertising displays shall be constructed with substantial,
permanent, weather-resistant materials.
   (K)   Any sign located, or left remaining, in violation of this section
shall be immediately removed by the city’s Code Enforcement Officer, or his or
her designee, if the sign’s removal may be accomplished by simply pulling it
from the ground or removing it from a pole, tree, post and the like and any
such sign shall be temporarily retained at the city landfill for a period of 14
days to allow the rightful owner an opportunity to reclaim it. After 14 days,
the sign shall be disposed of at the city landfill. In the event the sign is
affixed by a more permanent means, and its owner can be readily identified, the
Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the owner, in writing, of the violation,
and further notify the owner that the sign must be removed within ten days from
the receipt of the written notification and it shall be assumed that the
notification is received with five days from the date affixed to the
notification. If the sign’s owner cannot be readily identified, or if the sign
is not so removed by the owner within the prescribed time period after written
notification, the Code Enforcement Officer or his or her designee, shall remove
the sign by all necessary means and the owner, if readily identifiable, shall
be liable to the city for the costs associated therewith, including the cost of
labor.

§ 158.023 BUILDING LINE SETBACK.
   (A)   A building line to establish a front yard for all buildings and
structures shall be established at a distance from the street right-of-way
equivalent to one-half the width of the right-of-way of the street on which the
building fronts. In no case shall this distance be less than 35 feet.
   (B)   Any lot, other than corner lots, which abuts on two streets shall have
a building line to establish a front yard setback for both streets. However,
any lot, other than corner lots, which abuts on two streets and the street
located at the rear of the property is classified as limited or controlled
access (no access is permitted) by the governing body, the building line
established along said street shall be considered a rear yard setback.
   (C)   The front yard setback requirement may be varied without Board of
Adjustment approval for new residential developments proposed on existing lots
of record in a R-1, Low Density Residential District, and R-2, Medium Density
Residential District, where the depth of principal buildings on adjoining
properties is less than the depth prescribed else where in this chapter. In
such case the front yard in question shall not be less than the shorter depth
of existing front yards on the two lots immediately adjoining the subject
property. Corner lots shall conform to applicable front yard setbacks of the
zoning district and commercial buildings shall not be used in analysis of front
yard setbacks.

§ 158.028 LANDSCAPE AND BUFFER AREA MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   The purpose of this section is to improve the appearance of vehicular use
areas and property abutting public right-of-ways; to buffer residential areas
from proposed commercial and industrial developments; to protect, preserve and
promote the aesthetic appeal, character and value of the community, and to
promote the public health and safety through the reduction of noise pollution,
air pollution, visual pollution, and artificial light glare.
   (A)   Conflicting regulations.  Should the requirements set forth in this
section be found in conflict with other provisions of these regulations,
building code, or other regulations, law, or ordinance, the regulations which
are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
   (B)   Landscaping requirements.
      (1)   Applicability. The landscaping provisions of this section are
applicable to the B-3, Highway Service Business District, I-1, Light Industrial
District, and I-2, Heavy Industrial District.
         (a)   New development. No new site development, building, structure,
or vehicle use area (VUA) shall hereafter be constructed unless landscaping is
provided as required by the provisions of this section.
         (b)   Change to existing development. No building, structure, or VUA
shall be expanded, moved, or reconstructed and no use shall be changed to
another use or increased in intensity unless landscaping is provided as
required by the provisions of this section. Landscaping shall be provided only
for any additional buildings, structures, or VUAs over and above that of the
existing development.
      (2)   Landscaping for vehicular use areas (VUAs). Any open VUA (excluding
loading, unloading, and storage areas in an industrial zone) containing 6,000
or more square feet of area, or 23 or more vehicular parking spaces, shall
provide and maintain landscaped areas equal to 10% of the VUA (i.e. for each
100 square feet, or fraction thereof, of VUA, ten square feet of landscaped
areas shall be provided).
         (a)   Minimum area. The minimum landscape area permitted shall be 60
square feet with a six feet minimum dimension to all trees, measured at the
center of the tree, from edge of pavement where vehicles overhang.
         (b)   Maximum contiguous area. In order to encourage the required
landscape areas to be properly dispersed, no required landscape area shall be
larger than 350 square feet in VUAs under 30,000 square feet in size, and no
required area shall be larger than 1,500 square feet in VUAs over 30,000 square
feet. The maximum distance between landscape areas shall be 120 feet measured
from the perimeter of the landscape areas edge of pavement. Landscape areas
larger than above are permitted as long as the additional area is in excess of
the required minimum.
         (c)   Minimum trees. A minimum of two trees shall be required for each
250 square feet, or fraction thereof, of required landscape area. Trees shall
have a clear trunk of at least five feet above the ground and be located at
least six feet, measured at the center of the tree, from the VUA edge of
pavement. The remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs or ground cover,
not to exceed two feet in height.
         (d)   VUA landscape islands. Landscape islands are required at the
ends of all parking bays within the VUA. A minimum of one tree shall be planted
within each landscape island. There shall be no more than 30 parking spaces in
a single row or 60 parking spaces in a double row between islands in a VUA.
Trees shall have a clear trunk of at least five feet above the ground and be
located at least four feet, measured at the center of the tree, from the VUA
edge of pavement.
         (e)   VUA setbacks. All VUAs shall be located no closer than five feet
of any property line or street right-of-way. Parked vehicles may hang over the
interior landscaped area no more than two and one-half feet, as long as
concrete or other wheel stops are provided to ensure no greater overhang or
penetration of the landscaped area. To assure that landscape materials do not
constitute a driving hazard, all landscape areas shall comply with the “sight
distance triangle” requirements of §
158.022.
         (f)   Credit for existing vegetation. Existing vegetation which is
proposed to be used to fulfill the landscape requirements shall be shown on the
required landscape plan, and may only be used when approved by the Planning
Commission. All vegetation to be used must be on the property requiring the
landscape plan. If in the future, the existing vegetation is removed, the
vegetation shall be replaced in compliance with this section.
      (3)   Screening for service structures. All service structures shall be
fully screened except when located in an industrial zone or when located more
than 30 feet above the established grade (roof-top structures). Service
structures in an industrial zone shall be fully screened when the development
is located adjacent to any zone except industrial. For the purpose of this
section, service structures shall include storage yards, propane tanks,
dumpsters, air conditioning units and condensers, electrical transformers and
other equipment or elements providing service to a building, structure, or VUA.
Permitted accessory structures shall not be considered as service structures.
         (a)   Location of screening. A continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall
or earth mound shall enclose any service structure on all sides unless such
structure must be frequently moved, in which case screening on all but one side
is required. The average height of the screening material shall be one foot
more than the height of the enclosed structure, but shall not be required to
exceed eight feet in height. Whenever a service structure is screened by plant
material, such material may not count toward the fulfillment of required
landscaping for VUAs.
         (b)   Protection of screening material. Whenever screening material is
placed around any trash disposal unit or waste collection unit which is emptied
or removed mechanically on a regularly occurring basis, a fixed barrier to
contain the placement of the container shall be provided within the screening
material on those sides where there is such material. The barrier shall be at
least 18 inches from the material and shall be of sufficient strength to
prevent possible damage to the screening when the container is moved or
emptied. The minimum front opening of the screening material shall be 12 feet
to allow service vehicles access to the container.
   (C)   Landscape buffer areas (LBAs). Landscape buffer areas (LBAs) shall be
provided for the purpose of minimizing conflict between commercial and
industrial developments adjoining residential areas.
      (1)   Applicability. The landscape buffer area (LBA) provisions of this
section are applicable to the B-2, General Business District, B-3, Highway
Service Business District, OP, Office and Professional District, I-1, Light
Industrial District, and I-2, Heavy Industrial District. No new site
development, building, structure, or vehicle use area (VUA) shall hereafter be
constructed unless LBAs are provided as required by the provisions of this
section.
      (2)   Responsibility of providing LBAs. The LBA requirements set forth in
this section shall be provided as a condition of development by the person in
charge of or in control of the property, whether as owner, lessee, tenant,
occupant, or otherwise, which proposes the use adjacent to any residential
district. A property owner securing a map amendment (zoning change) which
creates an incompatible situation shall be deemed the one who creates such
situation and shall immediately provide the LBA as a condition of the map
amendment (zoning change). If the incompatible situation already exists or is
created by a general map amendment (zoning change) sponsored by the Planning
Commission or Glasgow City Council, the LBA shall be provided as a condition of
the approval of any future subdivision or development plan of the affected
land.
      (3)   Minimum contiguous area. LBAs shall be contiguous and located along
the entire common property line of the subject property and any adjoining
residential district. An LBA within a B-2, General Business District, and OP,
Office and Professional District, shall have a minimum width of at least ten
feet. An LBA within a B-3, Highway Service Business District, shall have a
minimum width of at least 25 feet. LBAs located within an I-1, Light Industrial
District, shall have a minimum width of at least 35 feet and 50 feet when
located within an I-2, Heavy Industrial District. In situations where a slope
occurs along the LBA, the required landscaping and screening shall be placed
(in relation to the slope) where it will most effectively screen the more
intensive use from the adjoining property. The maximum allowed slope in an LBA
shall be three to one. No building, structure, or VUA shall be placed within an
LBA. LBAs shall not count toward required landscaping for VUAs.
      (4)   Planting materials and screening. The following table describes the
minimum landscape (planting materials and screening) requirements for a LBA
adjoining a residential area:
 
Zoning District Minimum Planting Materials and Screening
B-2 and OP      A double row continuous six feet high planting or hedge or a
                six feet high fence, wall, or earth mound.
                One deciduous shade tree and two evergreen trees per 120 linear
                feet of LBA, or fraction thereof, or four evergreen trees per
B-3             120 linear feet of LBA, or fraction thereof, and a double row
                continuous six feet high planting or hedge or a six feet high
                fence, wall, or earth mound.
 
 
Zoning District Minimum Planting Materials and Screening
                One deciduous shade tree and two evergreen trees per 100 linear
                feet of LBA, or fraction thereof, or four evergreen trees per
I-1 and I-2     100 linear feet of LBA, or fraction thereof, and a double row
                continuous six feet high planting or hedge or a six feet high
                fence, wall, or earth mound.
 
      (5)   Exceptions.
         (a)   Screening within an LBA may be waived by the Planning Commission
with the written concurrence of the adjoining property owner(s).
         (b)   LBAs may be waived by the Planning Commission when an arterial
or collector highway separates the subject property from an adjoining
residential district.
         (c)   LBAs are not required when a commercial property is used solely
for residential purposes. When a residential use within a commercial zone is
changed to another use, the LBA requirements of this section shall apply.
   (D)   Landscape materials. Landscape materials shall consist of the
following, and are described in more detail in the Plant Materials List, (see
Exhibit 1.0) and also available at the Planning Commission Office and Building
Inspection Department.
      (1)   Walls and fences. Walls shall be constructed of masonry and/or
concrete products and faced with natural stone, stone veneer, or brick. Fences
shall be constructed of wood or other weatherproof, durable materials generally
used in the exterior construction of buildings. Fence post shall be
structurally stable based on the material used, and shall have a maximum
spacing of eight feet on center. If wood is used, the posts shall be four-inch
by four-inch minimum. Posts shall be set in or anchored to crowned concrete
footers at least six inches larger in each direction than the post it supports.
The base of the footer shall be at least 24 inches below finished grade. If
wood is used for any member, it shall be softwood treated with water-borne
preservative to the American Wood Preservers Institute standard LP-2 for above
ground use or LP-22 for ground contact use, or all heart redwood, or all heart
cedar. All cut surfaces of pressure treated lumber shall be water-proofed. If
another material is used, it shall be weatherproof. Slats are to be minimum
one-half-inch in thickness and are to be placed on the outside of the fence
(decorative side facing residential area) unless the design is two-sided
(shadow-box, and the like). All hardware is to be galvanized or otherwise
rustproof. Chain link fencing without slats blocking public view may not be
used to meet the requirements of this section. Chain link fencing without slats
may be installed in the required landscape areas only if it is in addition to
the required continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall or earth mound. In
industrial zones, there shall be no height limitation on walls or fences; in
all other zones, however, there shall be an eight feet maximum height
restriction. All walls or fences shall have a minimum opacity of 80%. Walls and
fences allowed to meet the requirements of this section shall not be used for
the erection or display of any sign or other advertising device.
      (2)   Earth mounds. Earth mounds shall be physical barriers which block
or screen the view similar to a hedge, fence, or wall. Mounds shall be
constructed with proper and adequate plant material to prevent erosion. A
difference in elevation between areas requiring screening does not constitute
an earth mound. Maximum slope shall be three to one.
      (3)   Plants. All plant materials shall be living plants (artificial
plants are prohibited) and shall meet the requirements listed below. When plant
material is used for screening, the plant material must be able to provide the
required screening after three complete growing seasons. Trees are required to
provide the minimum required crown spread after four complete growing seasons.
         (a)   Quality. Plant materials used in conformance with provisions of
this section shall conform to the standards of the American Association of
Nurserymen and shall have passed any inspections required under State
regulations. Bare root plants, with the exception of shrubs and hedges, vines
and ground covers shall be prohibited.
         (b)   Deciduous trees (trees which normally shed their leaves in the
fall) shall be species having an average mature crown spread of greater than 15
feet and having trunk(s) which can be maintained with over five feet of clear
wood in areas which have visibility requirements. Trees having an average
mature spread of crown less than 15 feet may be substituted by grouping of the
same so as to create the equivalent of a 15 foot crown spread. A minimum
overall height of ten feet and a minimum caliper (trunk diameter, measured six
inches above ground) of at least one and three-fourths inches immediately after
planting shall be required. Trees of species whose roots are known to cause
damage to public roadways or other public works shall not be planted closer
than 15 feet to such public works, unless the tree root system is completely
contained within a barrier for which the minimum interior container dimensions
shall be five feet square and five feet deep and for which the construction
requirements shall be four inches thick, reinforced concrete.
         (c)   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of five feet
high with a minimum caliper of one and one-half inches immediately after
planting.
         (d)   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least 12 inches
in average height when installed. All plants shall be installed to provide a
minimum 50% winter opacity and an 80% summer opacity, between one foot above
finished grade level to the top of the required planting.
         (e)   Vines. Vines shall be at least 15 inches high at planting, and
are generally used in conjunction with walls or fences.
         (f)   Grass and ground cover. Grass of the fescus (Gramineak) or
Bluegrass (Poaceae) family shall be planted in species normally grown as
permanent lawns in Glasgow, and may be sodded, plugged, sprigged, or seeded;
except in swales or other areas subject to erosion, where solid sod, erosion
reducing net, or suitable mulch shall be used, nurse-grass seed shall be sown
for immediate protection until complete coverage otherwise is achieved. Grass
sod shall be clean and free of weeds and noxious pests or diseases. Ground
cover such as organic materials shall be planted not more than 15 inches on
center and in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and have 75% of
complete coverage after two complete growing seasons. In certain cases,
groundcover also may consist of rocks, pebbles, sand, and similar approved
materials.
   (E)   Maintenance and installation. All landscape materials shall be
installed in a sound, workmanship-like manner, and according to accepted, good
construction and planting procedures. Any landscape material which fails to
meet the minimum requirements of this section at the time of installation shall
be removed and replaced with acceptable materials. The person in charge of or
in control of the property whether as owner, lessee, tenant, occupant, or
otherwise shall be responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all
landscaping materials, and shall keep them in a proper, neat, and orderly
appearance, free from refuse and debris, at all times. All unhealthy or dead
plant material shall be replaced within one year, or by the next planting
period, whichever comes first; while other defective landscape material shall
be replaced or repaired within three months. Topping trees or the severe
cutting of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree
crown to such a degree as to remove the normal canopy shall not be considered
proper or permitted for the maintenance of trees as required by this section.
Violation of these installation and maintenance provisions shall be grounds for
the Building Inspection and/or Codes Enforcement Department to refuse a
building occupancy permit, require replacement of landscape material, or
institute legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of this section.
   (F)   Plan submission and approval.  
      (1)   Whenever any property is affected by the provisions of this
section, the property owner or developer shall submit a landscape plan for
review. The landscape plan shall be prepared and sealed by an architect,
landscape architect or engineer licensed to practice in the state when an open
VUA (excluding loading, unloading, and storage areas in an industrial zone) is
proposed which contains 6,000 or more square feet of area and/or 23 or more
vehicular parking spaces.
      (2)   The Building Inspection Department shall be the approving agency
where a landscape plan is required in conjunction with a building permit and/or
certificate of occupancy. The Planning Commission shall be the approving agency
where a landscape plan is required in conjunction with a subdivision plat,
development plan, and/or map amendment (zoning change).
   (G)   Building permit and certificate of occupancy.  
      (1)   When a landscaping plan is required for new development, no
building permit shall be issued until the required landscaping plan has been
submitted and approved, and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until
the landscaping is completed as certified by an on-site inspection by the
Building Inspection Department. When a landscaping plan is required for a
change to existing development, no use shall commence until the requirements of
this section have been satisfied.
      (2)   A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued prior to the
installation of a landscape plan, only with the submission of an acceptable
improvement guarantee. The person in charge of or in control of the property
whether as owner, lessee, tenant, occupant, or otherwise shall be responsible
for posting an acceptable improvement guarantee (surety bond, certified or
cashiers check, or irrevocable letter of credit from a banking institution with
offices in the state) with the Planning Commission. The amount of the
improvement guarantee shall be based upon the cost of the proper installation
of the uninstalled landscape material shown in the submitted plan with the cost
certified by a landscape contractor, architect, landscape architect or engineer
licensed to practice in the state. The amount of the improvement guarantee
shall also include an inflation factor and/or administrative contingency cost
of 15% of the base cost to complete the work in the event of the foreclosure of
the improvement guarantee.
   (H)   Posting of an improvement guarantee. After an improvement guarantee
has been posted, the landscaping material required in the approved landscaping
plan shall be installed within four months after the date of posting the
improvement guarantee. Extensions of the planting period may be granted by the
Planning Commission upon a demonstration by the property owner or developer
that such an extension is warranted because of adverse weather conditions or
unavailability of required plant materials. No more than three such two month
extensions may be granted. The improvement guarantee shall be called if the
required landscaping has not been installed by the end of the approved planting
period and the Planning Commission shall apply the proceeds of the improvement
guarantee to have the work completed. After the required improvements have been
constructed in accordance with the provisions of this section and upon final
inspection and approval, the Planning Commission shall release the improvement
guarantee.
   (I)   Plan content.  The contents of the plan shall include the following:
      (1)   Plot plan, drawn to an easily readable scale, showing and labeling
by name and dimensions, all existing and proposed property lines, easements,
buildings, and other structures, vehicular use areas (including parking stalls,
driveways, service areas, and the like) water outlets and landscape material
(including botanical name and common name, installation size, on center
planting dimensions where applicable, and quantities for all plants used).
      (2)   Typical elevations and/or cross sections as may be required.
      (3)   Title block with the pertinent names and addresses (property owner,
person drawing plan), scale, date, north arrow.

      (5)   The location and dripline of any existing significant trees or tree
stands, including those in fence rows and drainage areas, a general description
of type and size of trees, and any proposed provisions for preserving trees.
      (6)   Vehicle use areas, required and provided landscape areas, and
landscape buffer areas.
   (J)   Administration. The enforcement of this section shall be carried out
as set forth on the following section:
      (1)   Enforcement. The requirements of this section will be administered
by the Building Inspection Department and/or Planning Commission as outlined
above and enforced by the City Code Enforcement Officer. It shall be unlawful
to occupy any premises unless the landscaping provisions of this section have
been met.
      (2)   Violations. In cases where the person in charge of or in control of
the property whether as owner, lessee, tenant, occupant, or otherwise fails to
install required landscaping, or where the person in charge fails to properly
maintain required landscaping, the Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the
responsible party of such violation and order correction of the same. If
necessary, the appropriate authority shall institute appropriate action to
eliminate the violation.
      (3)   Penalties. Fines and other penalties may be imposed upon violators
in accordance with the provision of the Zoning Ordinance. After notification of
the responsible party, each day of continued violation shall constitute a
separate violation.
   (K)   Variances. In such individual situations where, by reason of
exceptional topographic, dimensional, shape, or other special circumstances of
the site, the enforcement of these requirements would create an undue hardship
on the applicant, that applicant may appeal an application for a variance to
the Board of Adjustment. In accordance with KRS 100.243 the applicant for a
proposed map amendment (zoning change), at the time of the filing of the
application for the map amendment (zoning change), may elect to have any
variances for the same development to be heard and finally decided by the
Planning Commission at the same public hearing set for the map amendment
(zoning change). The reviewing body may impose any reasonable condition or
restrictions on any variance it decides to grant.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
§ 158.225 PURPOSE.
   It is recognized that the Glasgow Zoning Ordinance provides zoning which
allows all types of residential, commercial, office and professional and
industrial uses and provides minimum standards in each zone to ensure the
health, safety, and welfare of the community. It is also recognized that such
traditional zoning practices can, at times, restrict and hamper innovative, but
proper approaches. This zoning classification is intended to establish areas
which allow for innovation which may not be accomplished through traditional
zoning techniques. Planned Unit Development zones are intended to: provide for
flexibility which would not be possible using traditional techniques; promote
the advantages of modern large-scale site planning for community development;
to promote the efficient uses of land and minimize land use conflicts; to
preserve, to the greatest extent possible, existing landscape features and
amenities; provide more usable and suitably located recreational, public, and
common facilities; to provide for development to further the implementation of
the adopted comprehensive plan.

PUBLIC SQUARE HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 158.290 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Cultural resource protection on the state and local level is growing
across the country. During the 1980s many states passed legislation that
mandated that preservation be integrated into local and state planning efforts.
An estimated 2,000 communities across the country have chosen to implement
historic preservation plans and design guidelines that preserve and protect the
historic integrity of their communities. The reasons for establishing design
guidelines are both aesthetic and economic. The preservation of historic
resources helps to enhance a community’s sense of character and identity. An
active preservation policy maintains and promotes property values and

considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter and no
portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in manner which diminishes

period of more than six months any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this chapter for the zoning district in which the

§ 158.417 NON-CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure existed at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of these
regulations by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height yards, its
location on the lot or other requirements concerning the structure, the
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (A)   No such non-conforming structure shall be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its non-conformity;
   (B)   Should the non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 55% of its
replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed, except
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter; and
   (C)   Should the non-conforming structure be moved for any reason for any

in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (B)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for the use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside the building.
   (C)   If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as a conditional use be changed to
another non-conforming use; provided that, the Board of Adjustment, either by
general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing non-conforming use. In permitting the change, the Board of
Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district and the non- conforming use may not
thereafter be resumed.
   (E)   When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18
months during any three year period, except when government action impedes
access to the premises, the structure or structure and premises in combination,
shall not thereafter be used, except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.

premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the non-conforming status of the land.

defined as damage to an extent of more than 55% of the replacement cost at time
of destruction.

applications for variances. The Board may impose any reasonable conditions or
restrictions on any variance it decides to grant. (KRS 100.241)

granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety or
welfare, will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will
not cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public, and will not allow an
unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In
making these findings, the Board shall consider whether:
         (a)   The requested variance arises from special circumstances which
do not generally apply to land in the general vicinity or in the same zone;
         (b)   The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an
unnecessary hardship on the applicant; and

taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is
sought.
      (2)   The Board shall deny any request for a variance arising from

regulation by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation
from which relief is sought.

§ 158.482 ISSUANCE OF A BUILDING PERMIT.
   (A)   In the application to the Building Inspector for a building permit,
the applicant shall submit a plat of the building lot prepared by a registered
land surveyor and a dimensioned sketch or scale plan indicating the shape,

building permit a certification from a registered land surveyor that the
proposed construction for which the permit is requested conforms with all
setback, side yard and rear yard requirements and that all buildings proposed
to be constructed are properly located on the lot for which the building permit
is sought, either one or both at the discretion of the Building Inspector.
   (B)   However, the Building Inspector may waive this request at his or her
sole discretion if the proposed construction does not require either a plat or
certificate. He or she shall also state the existing and intended use of all
such buildings and supply such other information as may be required by the
Building Inspector for determining whether the provisions of this chapter are
being observed. If the proposed excavation or construction as set forth in the
application are in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and other
ordinances of the city then in force, the Building Inspector shall issue a
building permit for the excavation or construction. If a building permit is
refused, the Building Inspector shall state this refusal, in writing, with the
cause, and shall immediately thereupon mail notice of the refusal to the
applicant at the address indicated upon the application. The Building Inspector
shall grant or deny the permit within a reasonable time from the date the
application is submitted.
   (C)   (1)   The issuance of a permit shall in no case be construed as
waiving any provisions of this chapter.

§ 158.498 ACTION BY THE HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION.
   (A)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing on each certificate of
appropriateness within 30 days after a completed application is received by the
Commission. The Commission shall make a decision on the application within 45
days after the receipt of a completed application provided that the Commission
may extend the time for decision an additional 60 days when the application is
for demolition or new construction. The Commission shall approve or disapprove
each application, and it shall give its reasons for its decision using the
criteria contained in these guidelines. The Commission may suggest
modifications to an application and may then approve a certificate of
appropriateness providing for revisions in the plans submitted. If the
Commission fails to decide on an application within the specified time period,
the application shall be deemed approved.
   (B)   Notice of the public hearing shall be given at least 14 days in
advance of the hearing by first-class mail, with certification by the
Commission secretary or other appointed officer that the notice was mailed to
the applicant and to an owner of every parcel of property adjoining the subject
property. It shall be the duty of the applicant to furnish the Commission the
names and addresses of the owners of all adjoining property. Records maintained
by the Property Valuation Administrator may be relied upon conclusively to
determine the identity and address of the owner. If the property is in
condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, the person notified by mail
shall be the president or chairman of the owner group which administers
property commonly owned by the condominium or cooperative owners. A joint
notice may be mailed to two or more co-owners of an adjoining property who are

§ 158.499 CRITERIA IN DECIDING ON APPLICATIONS.
   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall use design
guidelines adopted by the City Council. The Commission shall consider: the
effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the property in the historic
district upon which work is to be done; and the relationship between such work
and other structures on the landmark site or other property in the historic
district. In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the Commission shall
consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style,
design, arrangement, texture, materials and color. The certificate of
appropriateness from the Commission shall not relieve the applicant from
complying with the requirements of other state and local laws and regulations.

§ 158.500 CONSULTATION WITH APPLICANTS.
   In making a decision on an application, the Commission shall be aware of the
importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the applicant. The
Commission shall also recognize the importance of approving plans that will be
reasonable for the applicant to carry out. Before an applicant prepares his or
her plans, he or she may bring a tentative proposal to the Commission for its
comments.

§ 158.501 ROUTINE ALTERATIONS - ORDINARY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The Commission shall prepare a list of routine alterations that shall
receive immediate approval from the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Commission
without a public hearing when an applicant complies with the specifications of
the design guidelines. The list shall include suggested paint colors
appropriate for different types of building such as repairs to doors, windows,
awnings, roofs, etc. At each meeting the Commission shall be informed of the
certificates of appropriateness that have been issued under this provision.
   (B)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a landmark, a landmark
site or a property in a local historic district does not change its exterior
appearance that is visible to the public. Every person in charge of a landmark
or a property in a historic district shall keep in good repair: all of the
exterior portions of such buildings or structures; and all interior portions
thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause such buildings or structures to
deteriorate or become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair.
The purpose of this provision is to prevent a person from forcing the
demolition of his or her building by neglecting it and by permitting damage to
the building because of weather or vandalism. No provision in these Design
Guidelines shall be interpreted to require an owner or tenant to undertake an
alteration or to restore his or her building to its original appearance. The
provisions of these Design Guidelines shall be in addition to the provisions of
the Kentucky Building Code requiring buildings and structure to be kept in good
repair.

emergency conditions dangerous to life, health, or property affecting a
landmark, a landmark site, or a property in a local historic district and the
owner shall promptly provide evidence of the dangerous conditions that has been
prepared by a person with professional qualifications in evaluating buildings
and structures.
   (B)   At its next meeting the Commission shall be informed of the
certificates of appropriateness that were issued. In situations requiring
temporary action, an owner may do work in order to temporarily protect his or
her property from further damage provided he or she reports this work to the
Commission within two business days.
   (C)   In any case where the City Code Enforcement Officer determines that
there are emergency conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting
a landmark, a landmark site, or a property in a historic district, he or she
may order the remedying of these conditions without the approval of the
Commission. The City Code Enforcement Officer shall promptly notify the
Chairperson of the Commission of the action being taken. If consultation is not
possible, the city shall notify the Commission of the action taken after the
completion of the work.
   (D)   In the case of unusual circumstances whereby the normal process for
obtaining a certificate of appropriateness creates undue hardship for the
health, safety and welfare of the applicant, the Commission may at its
discretion waive the normal process and give immediate approval for a
certificate of appropriateness. The Commission shall site its reasons for such
immediate approval.

   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall
conform to the provisions of such certificate. It shall be the responsibility
of the Commissioners or its designee to inspect from time to time any work
being performed to assure such compliance. In the event work is being performed
which is not in accordance with such certificate, the city shall issue a stop
work order. All work shall cease in the designated property. No additional work
shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect.
The Commission shall meet with the owner or tenant to resolve the problem. The
City Attorney may seek in Circuit Court an injunction and any other appropriate
relief in order that the intent of these design guidelines shall be carried
out.

§ 158.504 LENGTH OF VALIDITY OF A CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   A certificate of appropriateness shall remain valid for one year after it is
issued. Work is required to start before the end of the one-year period. If the
approved work has not been completed within two years after the certificate of
appropriateness was issued, the Commission shall review the situation and may
require an application for a certificate of appropriateness for the work that
remains to be done.

§ 158.506 DEMOLITION.
   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark, a building or structure on
a landmark site or a building or structure in the local historic district, the
Commission shall negotiate with the applicant to see if an alternative to
demolition can be found. The Commission may ask interested individuals and
organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to demolition and in
obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs for the threatened building. After
its public hearing, the Commission may decide that a building or structure in
the historic district or on a landmark site in the local historic district may
be demolished because it does not contribute to the historic district or to a
landmark. On all other demolition applications, the Commission shall study the
question of economic hardship for the applicant and shall determine whether the
landmark or property in the local historic district can be put to reasonable
beneficial use without the approval of the demolition application. In the case
of an income-producing building, the Commission shall also determine whether
the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from his or her building. The
Commission may ask applicants for additional information to be used in making
these determinations. If economic hardship or the lack of a reasonable return
is not proved, the Commission shall deny the demolition application unless the
Commission finds grounds to grant the demolition application as outlined in §
158.499 “Criteria in Deciding on Applications”.

on a landmark site, or a building or structure in a local historic district or
when an applicant wishes to move a building or structure to a landmark site or
a lot containing a landmark or to a property in a local historic district, the
Commission shall consider:
      (1)   The contribution the building or structure makes to its present
setting;
      (2)   Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated;
      (3)   Whether the building or structure can be moved without significant
damage to its physical integrity; and
      (4)   The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed site
and adjacent properties.

(Ord. 2803, passed 12-10-2012) Penalty, see §
160.99
§ 160.21 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   The following rules shall govern the design of improvements with respect to
managing stormwater runoff:
   (A)   Methods of determining stormwater runoff rate and volume. The volume
of required stormwater storage and runoff shall be calculated on the basis of
the runoff from a 25-year frequency storm with 24-hour duration. The
calculations can be made in accordance with the instantaneous runoff factor
method, the rational method or other methods that may be deemed appropriate by
the Stormwater Manager.
   (B)   Release rate.
      (1)   All developments undertaken as outlined in that chapter shall be
done in such a way as to insure that stormwater falling on a given site shall
be absorbed or detained on site to the extent that the controlled release rate
of stormwater runoff from all developments shall not exceed the pre-development
stormwater runoff rate. The rate at which stormwater runoff is delivered to a
designated stormwater storage area shall be unrestricted.
      (2)   In the event that the Stormwater Manager determines that the
natural downstream channel or storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate
the release rate provided above, then the allowable release rate shall be
reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the downstream channel or
storm sewer system.
   (C)   Development design.
      (1)   Where it can be demonstrated by the developer that a higher storm
water release rate will not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this
chapter and where such proposed release rate will not adversely affect
properties in the downstream portion of the watershed, the Stormwater Manager
may permit such release to be used as deemed appropriate.
      (2)   Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be
located and laid out in such a manner as to minimize the velocity of overland
flow and allow maximum opportunity for infiltration of stormwater into the
ground and to preserve and utilize existing and planned streams, channels and
detention basins and include whenever possible, streams and floodplain within
parks and other public grounds.
   (D)   Excess stormwater passage.
      (1)   An excess stormwater passage shall be provided for all stormwater
areas. Such passage shall have the capacity to convey through the proposed
development the excess stormwater. The capacity for a passage shall be such
that it will be able to transport the peak rate of run-off from a 100-year, 24-
hour return frequency storm.
      (2)   There shall be no buildings or structures constructed within excess
storm water passage, however, parking lots, playgrounds and park areas, which
shall not impair or endanger the water holding capability of a development,
shall be considered compatible uses.
      (3)   Appropriate land planning shall be undertaken to preserve the
existing natural drainage of a proposed development as part of the excess
stormwater passage.
      (4)   Open channels shall be protected from erosion by appropriate
vegetative covers, lining or other treatment and earthen channel side slopes
shall be no steeper than two to one. Open channels with lining shall have a
maximum gradient on side slopes of 67% and channel side slopes steeper than 67%
shall be designed as structural retaining walls.
   (E)   Stormwater storage/detention areas. The increased stormwater runoff
resulting from the proposed development may be accommodated by the provision of
appropriate detention facilities including wet or dry bottom reservoirs, flat
roofs, parking lots or streets. Storage areas shall be designed, if possible to
provide secondary purposes for recreation, open spaces, parking lot or other
types of use that will not be adversely affected by intermittent flooding. The
following shall govern the design of detention facilities:
      (1)   Storage volume.
         (a)   All stormwater storage areas must be designed to contain and
safely pass stormwater runoff. The combined capacity of these storage areas
shall be sufficient to contain the storm from the development. The detention
facility must be designed for periodic maintenance and energy dissipaters shall
be provided at points necessary.
         (b)   The ponding of stormwater runoff shall not exceed a depth of one
foot on a pedestrian mall area or 1-1/2 feet maximum in parking lots. Where
these areas are used for ponding the maximum depth should occur in the most
remote and least used areas.
         (c)   The drainage and grading design shall be prepared to insure that
in a 100-year storm the depth of water run-off in any street, alley, or
pedestrian mall will not exceed the level of the first floor of any building.
         (d)   For wet pond storage areas when calculating the storage
capacity, only the volume available to store excess stormwater shall be
considered. Permanent water storage does not constitute control of excess storm
runoff.
      (2)   Release rate. At no time during the design storm shall the
stormwater runoff release rate exceed the allowable release rate as set forth
in division (B) of this section.
      (3)   Release velocity. Detention facilities shall release stormwater at
a non-erosive velocity. The protected channel receiving the detention discharge
shall incorporate features to reduce velocity to non-erosive levels at the
point where such discharge enters the unprotected channel. If release is into a
subsurface conduit the energy gradient in the receiving facility shall not be
increased beyond the slope of the conduit.
      (4)   Spillway.
         (a)   Overflow for each stormwater storage area shall be provided in
the event of a storm in excess of the design capacity occurs. Such overflows
shall be constructed to function without specific attention and shall become
part of the excess stormwater passage.
         (b)   Emergency spillways shall be provided to permit the safe passage
of runoff generated from a 100-year, 24-hour storm, or greater if required by
state law.
         (c)   Where rooftop storage or excess stormwater is provided, the
building shall be provided with adequate structural design to insure that roof
failure does not occur. Overflow areas shall be provided so that the weight of
stored stormwater will not exceed the structural capacity of the roof.
      (5)   Freeboard.  Detention facilities shall have adequate capacity to
contain storage volume of tributary stormwater runoff with at least one foot of
freeboard above the water surface of flow in the emergency spillway in a 100-
year, 24-hour storm or as required by state law.
   (F)   Sinkholes and subterranean water channels.
      (1)   The use of sinkholes or subterranean water channels for direct
drainage of excess stormwater shall not be permitted although they may be used
to drain a stormwater storage area. The introductions of any foreign matter or
the filling, clogging or interfering with the natural drainage capabilities of
the sinkholes shall not be permitted.
      (2)   Sinkholes shall not be altered in any way which would negatively
affect the drainage capabilities of the sinkhole. Development within the 100-
year floodplain of a sinkhole shall not be permitted.
(Ord. 2809, passed 12-10-2012) Penalty, see §
160.99
§ 160.22 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Stormwater channel location. Generally acceptable locations of
stormwater channels in the design of a subdivision may include but are not
limited to the following:
      (1)   Adjacent to roadways.
      (2)   In a depressed median of a divided roadway, provided the median is
wide enough to permit slopes of one foot drop in six feet horizontal or
flatter.
      (3)   Centered on lot lines or entirely within the rear yards of a single
row of lots or parcels.
   (B)   In each of the foregoing cases drainage easement with sufficient width

plat.
   (C)   Storm sewer outfall. The storm sewer outfall shall be designed to
provide adequate protection against downstream erosion and scouring.
   (D)   Lot lines. Whenever the plans call for the passage and/or storage of
stormwater runoff along lot lines, the grading of all such lots shall be
prescribed and established for the passage and/or storage of waters, and no
structure or vegetation which would obstruct the flow of stormwater shall be
allowed nor shall any change be made to the prescribed grades and contours of
the specified stormwater channels.
   (E)   Manholes. All utility sewer manholes constructed in an area designed
for the storage or passage of stormwater, shall be provided with either a
watertight manhole cover or be constructed with a rim elevation of a minimum of
one foot above the high water elevation of the design storm.
   (F)   Easements. Permanent easements for the detention and conveyance of
stormwater, including easements of access to structures and facilities, shall
be dedicated to the city.
   (G)   Obstruction of drainage. The keeping or disposal of grass clippings,
trash, debris, obstruction or unwanted materials into the storm sewers or
within or along stormwater channels or in adjacent floodplain areas which may
wash into sewers and channels is prohibited.
   (H)   Maintenance. Required maintenance for detention basins or other
structures shall be permanently provided by the developer with responsibility
becoming that of the private landowner after complete development, subject to
inspection of the Stormwater Manager. Every entity shall be specified. Refer to
§
160.31 for maintenance requirements.
   (I)   Encroachment permit (city right-of-way).
      (1)   All new construction projects (residential, commercial or
industrial) which require a permanent or temporary entrance onto an existing
city street or a newly developed street which is to be dedicated to the city at
a later time and which can impact proper street drainage shall apply for an
encroachment permit at the Office of Public Works. The encroachment permit form
will be supplied by the city. The encroachment permit should be complete in
sufficient detail to show the location of said entrance with respect to
property lines. The encroachment permit shall detail the pipe size, material
and slope/grade.
      (2)   This encroachment permit shall be obtained prior to issuance of a
building permit by the Planning and Zoning Office.
      (3)   The fee required for the encroachment permit shall be as listed in
§
97.17 Application Fee; Bond. This encroachment permit fee is fully refundable
provided the entrance is constructed as detailed and approved on said
encroachment permit.

160.99
§ 160.23 POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   Land development projects and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion and sediment
transport and deposition; this stormwater runoff contributes to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants and; stormwater runoff, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the
regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites.
      (2)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum post stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general
health, safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this
jurisdiction. The goal is to maintain or improve the quality of all streams
within the MS4 boundaries to meet their designated use. This chapter seeks to
meet that purpose through the following objectives:
         (a)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation and stream bank erosion and maintain the
integrity of stream channels;
         (b)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution cause by
stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
         (c)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable.
         (d)   Reduces stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution where possible, through stormwater management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are property maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
   (B)   The Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan shall be submitted
for all subdivisions that discharge to MS4 high quality waters. This includes
residential, commercial, and industrial developments. The PC-SWMP is required
for all sites one acre and larger in size, and all sites part of a greater
common development.
   (C)   The city reserves the right to develop or adopt other guidance
documents to serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance
documents distributed by the city should be reviewed and considered when
preparing the Post Construction SWMP. These documents may be applied as
standards by which designs are to be prepared and controls implemented.
   (D)   The city shall have the authority to implement this chapter by
appropriate regulations, guidance or other related materials. In this regard,
technical administrative or procedural matters may be modified as needed to
meet the objective herein.
(Ord. 2809, passed 12-10-2012)
§ 160.24 POST-CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   The city reserves the right to develop or adopt guidance documents to
serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance documents
distributed by the city should be reviewed and considered when preparing the
Post-Construction SWMP. Technical, administrative or procedural matters may be
modified as needed to meet the objectives defined in this chapter as long as
they are not contrary or beyond the intent of the objectives listed above. Such
documents given authority by this chapter include Best Management Practice
(BMP) manuals, design regulations and requirements, checklists that address
submittals, plan review and inspections certification, stormwater manuals, and
operation and maintenance manuals. Said documents may be updated periodically
to reflect the most current and effective design and construction practices and
be made available to the public. Failure to update the manual does not relieve
the applicant from complying with this chapter.
   (B)   Post-construction stormwater BMPs shall be designed in accordance with
the most current manual or requirements to achieve the following performance
standards:
      (1)   The development shall be designed with management measures that are
built and maintained to treat, filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen, evapo-
transpire, harvest and reuse stormwater runoff, or otherwise manage the
stormwater quality produced from the 80th percentile rain event (0.6 inches of
rainfall).
      (2)   BMP’s shall be designed to remove pollutants and reduce runoff
volume. The designated use and any existing in-stream use of the stream being
discharged to shall be protected. Some land uses produce higher concentrations
of certain pollutants such as hydrocarbons or heavy metals, than those normally
found in urban areas. These areas will be reviewed for effective removal of the
particular pollutant which they discharge. Effective removal will be that which
existed prior to development. Examples of land uses that produce higher levels
of pollutants are:
         (a)   Gas/fueling stations.
         (b)   Restaurant dumpster areas.
         (c)   Vehicle repair facilities.
         (d)   Vehicle washing/steam cleaning facilities.
         (e)   Auto recycling facilities.
         (f)   Outdoor material storage areas.
         (g)   Loading and transfer areas.
         (h)   Landfills.
         (i)   Industrial sites.
      (3)   BMPs shall reduce or buffer increases in stormwater runoff
temperature caused by contact with impervious surfaces as well as minimize
increases in stormwater runoff volume and flow rate caused by increases in
impervious surfaces.
      (4)   The PC-SWMP shall include provisions for buffers. A buffer shall be
defined as:
         (a)   Area contained within a boundary established by the FEMA
floodplain boundary or city master planning; or
         (b)   Where a floodplain is not defined or calculated, the buffer will
be 25 feet on each side from the top of waterway bank as defined by geomorphic
shape (not by current water surface elevation).
            1.   Buffers shall be provided to all blue-line streams as shown on
the USGS map.
            2.   Buffer areas and floodplain may be used for stormwater quality
devices provided erosion prevention, sediment control, cut-fill practices area
addressed appropriately as determined by the city to meet this chapter.
            3.   Exemptions can be granted to buffers so long as erosion and
sediment control, water quality are addressed. Exemptions for building in the
buffer area shall be granted for:
               a.   Roads and utilities crossing waterways.
               b.   Pedestrian trails and walkways adjacent to waterways.
               c.   Other exemptions may be made at the discretion of the city
representative.
      (5)   Redevelopment not previously addressing water quantity or quality
control shall reduce the discharge from their site according to the formula
below:
         Q(redeveloped) = Q(existing) + q(undeveloped)
                     2
         Q(redeveloped) = maximum discharge rate for the re-development
         Q(existing) = current discharge rate of the developed parcel
         Q(undeveloped) = discharge rate of the parcel prior to any development
         The reduction of allowable flow rate for redeveloped areas shall not
exceed more than 30% of the existing developed flow rate. These flow rates are
based on redevelopment sites that disturb one acre or more.
      (6)   The City of Glasgow reserves the right to require superseding or
additional treatment criteria or objectives for specific pollutants(s) as
necessary to meet overall stormwater quality management program objectives or
directives under a watershed improvement or Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)
program as administered by the USEPA or Commonwealth of Kentucky.
      (7)   The Stormwater Manager, in accordance with good engineering
practice, may exercise the following options:
         (a)   Off-site mitigation option: Entails infiltration/
evapotranspiration/reuse measures that may be implemented at another location
within the same watershed as the original project, approved by the city. The
city shall identify priority areas within the watershed in which mitigation
projects can be completed.
         (b)   Payment-in-lieu option: Allows the owner of a project that falls
within the quality criteria, to make a payment to the city in lieu of
implementing post-construction BMPs. The city will apply the in-lieu funds to a
public stormwater project. The fee shall be used for acquisition, design,
construction or maintenance of one or more such facilities in the same
watershed in which the development is located.
      (8)   Permanent easement for all stormwater drainage ways, quality and
quantity facilities shall be dedicated to the City of Glasgow. There shall also
be dedicated easement for access to all stormwater management facilities.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
§ 160.40 RESPONSIBILITY.
   The administration of this chapter shall be the responsibility of the
offices of the designated Stormwater Manager.
(Ord. 2809, passed 12-10-2012)
§ 160.41 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Standards. Variances from these standards, provisions, and
specifications may be granted when it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the SWAC (Stormwater Advisory Committee) that, owing to special conditions, a
strict adherence to the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship and that the spirit and intent of the chapter will be observed.
   (B)   Fee. The fee for a variance hearing is $335. Three hundred dollars for
the variance hearing and $35 for publication.
   (C)   Procedure.  
      (1)   A written request for variance shall be filed by the owner, seeking
to develop or change the use of his or her property, or his agent with the
Stormwater Manager and shall state specifically what variance is sought and the
public’s interest in granting the variance. The applicant must specify hardship
to result in following the prescribed regulations. The Stormwater Manager must
then examine and decides the validity of the proposed hardships. This request
is then submitted to the SWAC by the Stormwater Manger along with a
recommendation about granting the variance.
      (2)   The variance will be granted only upon showing that there is good
and sufficient cause and that the failure to grant a variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant. Financial hardships to the property
owners do not constitute operator appropriate grounds for a variance under this
chapter.
(Ord. 2809, passed 12-10-2012)
§ 160.42 DRAINAGE CONTROL.
   (A)   A record of all variance actions shall be maintained by the Stormwater
Manager including the justification for issuance.
   (B)   Variances may be considered for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the State Inventory of Historic Places.
(Ord. 2809, passed 12-10-2012)
§ 160.43 OFFICIAL MAPS AND PROFILES.
   Responsibility for all changes to official maps and profiles remains with
the Stormwater Manger.
(Ord. 2809, passed 12-10-2012)
§ 160.44 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   The Stormwater Manager shall be responsible for determining whether
the stormwater management plan is in conformance with requirements specified by
the city and whether the development is proceeding in accordance with the
approved stormwater management plan. Periodic inspection of the development
site shall be made by the Stormwater Manager to ensure that the stormwater
management plan is properly implemented.
   (B)   The Stormwater Manager, Planning and Zoning and other duly authorized
employees bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to
enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation and
measurement, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2809, passed 12-10-2012)
§ 160.45 CERTIFICATION.
   At the completion of the improvements approved in the stormwater management
plan, the applicant shall provide to the Stormwater Manager a certification by
a professional engineer that the improvements have been built in conformance
with the plan.
(Ord. 2809, passed 12-10-2012)
§ 160.46 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Work suspension.  In the event that work performed does not conform to
the provisions of the approved stormwater management plan and specification, a
written notice to comply shall be served upon the developer. Such notice shall
set forth the nature of the correction required and the time within which
corrections shall be made. Failure to comply with such notice shall result in
the issuance of a stop work order applicable to all construction activity
except that necessary for correction of the violation. Upon collection of the
violation the stop work order shall be voided and construction may resume.
   (B)   Appeals.  A developer may appeal any decision made by the Stormwater
Manager to the SWAC within 30 days of the date of notification.
   (C)   Bond forfeiture.
      (1)   In the event of continued violation of the approved stormwater
management plan, a public hearing on the matter shall be conducted by the SWAC.
      (2)   Written notice of such hearing shall be served upon the developer
by registered mail, and shall state:
         (a)   The grounds for complaint.
         (b)   The time and place such hearing is to be held.
         (c)   Such notice shall be served at least 15 days prior to the date
set for the hearing. At any such hearing, the developer shall be given an
opportunity to be heard, and he may call witness and present evidence on his or
her behalf. After such hearing, if the SWAC concludes that the issuance of
additional correction notices would be futile, any bonds or cash deposits
posted with the city shall be forfeited, whereupon said security shall be used
for completion of the stormwater management plan as approved.
   (D)   Post-construction stormwater management facilities/BMPs.
      (1)   When deficiencies are noted upon inspection by the city, the city
shall provide the property owner copies of the inspection report with findings
and evaluations. The owner then has 30 days to get the stormwater facilities in
working order as per its original design function.
      (2)   In the event the property owner neglects to make repairs upon
notification, and or fails to maintain the stormwater management facilities in
good working condition acceptable to the city, the city may enter upon the
property and take whatever steps it deems necessary to maintain said stormwater
management/BMP facilities and to charge the costs of the repairs to the
landowner, its successors and assigns. This provision shall not be construed to
all the City of Glasgow to erect any structure of a permanent nature on the
property of the landowner, outside of an easement for stormwater management/BMP
facilities. It is expressly understood and agreed that the city is under no
obligation to maintain or repair said facilities
      (3)   In the event the city performs work of any nature, or expends any
fund in performance of said work for labor, use of equipment, supplies,
materials and the like on account of the landowner, its successors and assigns,
the landowner shall reimburse the city upon demand, within 30 days of receipt
thereof for all costs incurred by the city.
(Ord. 2809, passed 12-10-2012)
§ 160.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates or fails to comply with any of
the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction, shall be subject to a fine not less than $25, nor more than $200. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a
violation occurs or continues.
