   DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC SECURITY

   Frankfort
   PLAN AND AGREEMENT
   City of Richmond, Kentucky
      (2)   Hereinafter called “political subdivision,” this shall hereby apply
to the state agency, pursuant to the provisions of KRS 61.460, to extend the
insurance system established by 42 USC 401 et seq. to services performed by
individuals as employees of the political subdivision.
   (B)   The political subdivision submits for the state agency's approval this
plan and agreement to become effective on the date hereinafter stated.
('79 Code, § 2-127) (Ord. A-25, passed 9-18-51)
§ 32.42 SERVICES COVERED.
   This plan and agreement includes all services performed by individuals for
the political subdivision except those officers elected by vote of the
qualified electors of said city.
('79 Code, § 2-128) (Ord. A-25, passed 9-18-51)
§ 32.43 ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN.
   The political subdivision agrees and has heretofore authorized and directed
the appropriate officers and employees to do and perform all things found
necessary by the state agency to the proper and efficient administration of the
plan, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of employment records
relating to both services and salaries, required contributions by both the
political subdivision and its employees and other data required by the state
agency or the federal security administrator, to make such reports in such form
and containing such information as the state agency may from time to time
require, and to comply with such provisions as the state agency or the federal
security administrator may from time to time find necessary to assure the
correctness and verification of such reports.
('79 Code, § 2-129) (Ord. A-25, passed 9-18-51)
§ 32.44 CONTRIBUTIONS BY CITY.
   (A)   The political subdivision shall pay into the contribution fund
established by KRS 61.470, with respect to wages as defined in KRS 61.420, at
such time or times as the state agency may by regulation prescribe,
contributions equivalent to the sum of the taxes which would be imposed by 26
USC 1401 or 3101, if the services covered by this plan and agreement
constituted employment as defined in 26 USC 3121 or 3306.
   (B)   (1)   The political subdivision agrees to levy a tax on all property
assessed for taxation by the political subdivision for each and every year this
contract shall be and remain in force, which levy shall be sufficient in
itself, or when added to any balance remaining from previous levies, to insure
the payment of the obligations of the political subdivision to the state agency
imposed by this contract for the ensuing fiscal year; and the payment of such
obligations shall be specifically provided for in the political subdivision's
budget for each and every year this agreement shall be and remain in force. In
determining the rate of taxation for such annual levies, the political
subdivision shall anticipate the collection of taxes in an amount not to exceed
90% of the levy. All collections pursuant to said levy shall be covered into a
revolving fund, to be created by the political subdivision, which shall be
devoted exclusively to the payment of the obligations imposed under this
contract, as and when the same shall become due and payable, until all of such
obligations shall have been satisfied in full.
      (2)   Provided, however, for the last six months of the fiscal year
commencing January 1, 1951 and ending December 31, 1951, or for any subsequent
full fiscal year hereunder, the foregoing requirements of this division may be
dispensed with by the political subdivision paying in advance into its
revolving fund an amount of money sufficient to meet the combined employer-
employees contributions for such fiscal year.
   (C)   The political subdivision agrees to and shall advance to the
contribution fund, provided for in KRS 61.470, an amount equal to the average
quarterly contributions provided for in division (A) of this section plus 10%
thereof, which shall be credited to the political subdivision in the
contribution fund account. The average quarterly contribution shall be arrived
at in the first instance by a fair estimate based on the payroll for the
previous calendar year; provided, however, that said advancement may be
adjusted from time to time as the state agency may require, and when adjusted
the estimate shall be based on the payroll for the calendar quarter immediately
preceding the date of the adjustment. The advancement provided for herein may
be used by the state agency to offset any unpaid financial obligation incurred
by the political subdivision hereunder, and for no other purpose, and may be
applied thereto summarily, but such use shall not relieve the political
subdivision of such obligation to the state agency; provided, however, no
advancement by the political subdivision shall be applied to the default of any
other political subdivision.
   (D)   The political subdivision shall pay to the state treasury, at such
time or times as the state agency may by regulation prescribe, an amount equal
to the political subdivision's share of the cost of administration of the state
agency, such amount to be not greater than 5% of the contributions made by the
political subdivision under division (A) of this section.
   (E)   The political subdivision agrees that it shall impose upon each of its
employees, as to services which are covered by this plan and agreement, a
contribution with respect to his wages, not exceeding the amount of the tax
which would be imposed by 26 USC 3101 if such services constituted employment
within the meaning of that statute, and to deduct the amount of such
contribution from his wages as and when paid. It is further understood that the
contributions so collected shall be paid into the contribution fund in partial
discharge of the liability of the political subdivision, but that failure to
make such deductions shall not relieve the employee or the political
subdivision from liability therefor.
('79 Code, § 2-130) (Ord. A-25, passed 9-18-51)
§ 32.45 DELINQUENT PAYMENTS.
   (A)   If more than the correct amount due of this plan and agreement is paid
with respect to any remuneration, proper adjustment, or refund, if adjustment
is impractical, shall be made without interest in such manner and at such times
as the state agency shall prescribe.
   (B)   If the political subdivision does not make, at the time or times due,
the payments required under this plan and agreement, there shall be added, as
part of the amounts due, interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or fraction
thereof.
   (C)   Without prejudice to other available methods of collection, the state
agency in its discretion may deduct such delinquent amounts plus interest from
any other money payable to the political subdivision by any department, agency
or fund of the state.
('79 Code, § 2-131) (Ord. A-25, passed 9-18-51)
§ 32.46 TERMINATION.
   (A)   The political subdivision may request the state agency to take all
necessary steps with the federal security administrator, pursuant to 42 USC 418
(d)(5)(B), to terminate this plan and agreement either in its entire
application to the political subdivision or with respect to any coverage group.
Upon good cause shown at a time and in a manner to be specified by the state
agency, the state agency shall give the notice to the federal security
administrator required by 42 USC 418 for purpose of granting the requested
termination to the political subdivision.
   (B)   If the state agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the
political subdivision, finds that there has been a failure to comply
substantially with any provision contained in this plan and agreement or KRS
Chapter 61, it may terminate this plan in its entirety, such termination to
take effect at the time prescribed in such notice and on such conditions as may
be provided by regulations of the state agency, and as may be consistent with
the provisions of the Social Security Act.
('79 Code, § 2-132) (Ord. A-25, passed 9-18-51)
§ 32.47 MODIFICATION.
   This plan and agreement may be modified, at the request of the political
subdivision, to include coverage groups or services in addition to those now

and the provisions of § 218 of the Social Security Act.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 33.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “City of Richmond,
Kentucky Code of Ethics.”
(Ord. 94-50, passed 12-6-94; Am. Ord. 15-08, passed 6-9-15)
§ 33.02 FINDINGS.
   The legislative body of the city finds and declares that:
   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.
   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of this city depends upon
the public’s confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers
and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the private
interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled.
   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens with
the standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects then to comply with while
conducting their public duties.
(Ord. 94-50, passed 12-6-94; Am. Ord. 15-08, passed 6-9-15)
§ 33.03 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of assuring that
standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure requirements for officers
and employees of the city shall be clearly established, uniform in their
application, and enforceable, and to provide the officers and employees of the
city with advice and information concerning potential conflicts of interest
which might arise in the conduct of their public duties.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the requirements of
KRS 65.003 as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly and any amendments
made subsequent to that date.
   (C)   This chapter is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003 and any amendments made
subsequent to that date.
(Ord. 94-50, passed 12-6-94; Am. Ord. 15-08, passed )

(Ord. 94-50, passed 12-6-94; Am. Ord. 15-08, passed 6-9-15)
§ 33.16 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN CONTRACTS.
   (A)   Pursuant to KRS 61.252, no officer or employee of the city or any city
agency shall directly or through others undertake, execute, hold, or enjoy, in
whole or in part, any contract made, entered into, awarded, or granted by the
city or a city agency, except as follows:
      (1)   The prohibition in division (A) of this section shall not apply to
contracts entered into before an elected officer filed as a candidate for city
office, before an appointed officer was appointed to a city or city agency
office, or before an employee was hired by the city or a city agency. However,
if any contract entered into by a city or city agency officer or employee
before he or she became a candidate, was appointed to office, or was hired as
an employee, is renewable after he or she becomes a candidate, assumes the
appointed office, or is hired as an employee, then the prohibition in division
(A) of this section shall apply to the renewal of the contract.
      (2)   The prohibition in subsection (A) of this section shall not apply
if the contract is awarded after public notice and competitive bidding, unless
the officer or employee is authorized to participate in establishing the
contract specifications, awarding the contract, or managing the contract
performance after the contract is awarded. If the officer or employee has any
of the authorities as set forth in the preceding sentence, then the officer or
employee shall have no interest in the contract, unless the requirements set

governing body of the city or city agency before the contract is executed.
         (c)   A finding is made by the governing body of the city or city
agency that the contract with the officer or the employee is in the best
interests of the public and the city or city agency before the contract is
executed.
         (d)   The finding is made a part of the official record of the
governing body of the city or city agency before the contract is executed.
   (B)   Any violation of this section shall constitute a Class A misdemeanor,

city.
(Ord. 94-50, passed 12-6-94; Am. Ord. 15-08, passed 6-9-15)
§ 33.17 INCOMPATIBLE OFFICES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 165 of the Kentucky Constitution, no officer or
employee of the city may also be a state officer, deputy state officer or
member of the General Assembly or may fill more than one municipal office at
the same time, whether in the same or a different city.
   (B)   Pursuant to KRS 61.080, no city officer may also hold a county office.
In addition, the statute also states that the following city and consolidated
local government offices are incompatible with any other public office:
      (1)   Member of the legislative body in cities of the first class;
      (2)   Mayor and member of the legislative council of a consolidated local
government;
      (3)   Mayor and member of the legislative body in cities of the home rule
class; and
   (C)   In addition to the Constitution and statutory provisions, there are
common law incompatibilities that have been defined by the courts. City
officers and employment positions are deemed incompatible when one office or
position of employment was inherently inconsistent in function with the other
when there arises an implication that the duties and responsibilities of both
cannot be performed at the same time with a necessary degree of impartiality
and honesty.
   (D)   KRS 61.090 provides that the acceptance of an incompatible office
operates to vacate the first office.
(Ord. 15-08, passed 6-9-15)
§ 33.18 WITHDRAWAL FROM PARTICIPATION.
   (A)   An officer or employee must refrain from acting on or discussing,
formally or informally, a matter before the city, if acting on the matter, or
failing to act on the matter, may personally or financially benefit any of the
persons or entities listed in §
33.15(C) above. Such an officer or employee should join the public if the
withdrawal occurs at a public meeting, or leave the room if it is a legally
conducted closed meeting (executive session) under KRS 61.810 and KRS 61.815.
   (B)   Withdrawal at a meeting requires the public announcement, on the
record, of the reason for withdrawal.
   (C)   Ongoing conflict. An officer or employee whose outside employment or
other outside activity or relationship can reasonably be expected to require
more than sporadic withdrawal must resign or cease such outside employment or
activity. An officer or employee should not begin employment or an activity or
relationship that can reasonably be expected to require more than sporadic
withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is in such a situation, he or
she should not accept the position with the city.
   (D)   Request to withdraw. If an officer or appointed board member is
requested to withdraw from participation in a matter, for the reason that he or
she has a conflict of interest, by:
      (1)   Another member,
      (2)   A party to the current matter, or
      (3)   Anyone else who may be affected by a decision relating to this
matter,
the member must decide whether to withdraw on the official record. If the
member decides not to withdraw, the unchallenged members must consider any
relevant evidence concerning such claimed conflict of interest, as defined in
this code, and vote whether or not to allow the request and require that the
member withdraw from participating in the matter.
   (E)   If withdrawal by the member would leave the body with less than a
quorum capable of acting, the member must disclose the conflict on the public
record, then the remaining members may vote to allow the member with the
disclosed conflict a vote. If the person is the only one authorized by law to
act, the person must disclose the nature and circumstances of the conflict to
the Board of Ethics and ask for a waiver or advisory opinion.
(Ord. 15-08, passed 6-9-15)
§ 33.19 RECEIPT OF GIFTS.
   No officer, employee or appointee of the city shall, directly or indirectly,
solicit any gift or accept or receive any gift having of $75 or more, whether
in the form of money, service, loan, travel, entertainment, hospitality, thing
or promise or any other form, under circumstances in which it could reasonable
be inferred that the gift was intended to influence, or could reasonably be
expected to influence the officer, employee or appointee in the performance of
his or her official duties, or was intended as a reward for any official
action. This prohibition shall not include any gift accepted on behalf of the
city and transferred to the city.
(Ord. 15-08, passed 6-9-15)
§ 33.20 USE OF CITY PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL.
   No officer or employee of the city shall use or permit the use of any city
time, funds, personnel, equipment, or other personal or real property for the
private use of any person, unless:
   (A)   The use is specifically authorized by a stated city policy; or
   (B)   The use is available to the general public, and then only to the
extent and upon the terms that such use is available to the general public.
(Ord. 15-08, passed 6-9-15)
§ 33.21 MISUSE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   No officer or employee of the city or any city agency shall intentionally
use or disclose information acquired in the course or his or her official
duties, if the primary purpose of the use or disclosure is to further his or
her personal financial interest or that of another person or business.
Information shall be deemed confidential, if it is not subject to disclosure
pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act, KRS 61.872 to 61.884, at the time of
its use or disclosure.

of receipt. The Board shall forward within ten working days to each officer or
employee of the city or city agency who is the subject of the complaint a copy
of the complaint and a general statement of the applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   The Board of Ethics may, on its own initiative, determine through an
inquiry into informal allegations or information provided directly to the
Board, by referral, in the public news media, or otherwise that a violation of
this code may exist, and prepare a complaint of its own. The Board of Ethics
may also amend a complaint that has been filed with it by adding further
allegations, by adding respondents involved in the same conduct, directly or
indirectly, by action or inaction, or by deleting allegations that would not
constitute a violation of this code, have been made against persons or entities
not covered by this code, or do not appear to be supported by the facts. The
Board of Ethics may also consolidate complaints where the allegations are
materially related. Amended complaints must be sent to the complainant and
respondent by the Board of Ethics.
   (C)   Within 30 days of the receipt of a proper complaint, the Board of
Ethics shall conduct a preliminary inquiry concerning the allegations contained
in the complaint. The Board of Ethics shall afford a person who is the subject
of the complaint an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the complaint.

heard under oath, and to offer evidence in response to the allegations.
   (D)   The person who is the subject of the complaint (respondent) may file
with the Board of Ethics a response under oath to the complaint within 30 days
after his or her receipt of the complaint. The response, if any, must be sent
to the person filing the original complaint (complainant) by the Board of
Ethics within five days after its filing. Within 15 days after receipt, the
complainant may also file with the Board of Ethics a response under oath to the
respondent's response, which the Board of Ethics must send to the respondent
within five days after its filing.
   (E)   Extensions of time to any of the time limitations specified in this
section may be granted by the Board of Ethics upon a vote of the majority of

must give written notice of any extension(s) of time to the respondent and the

existence of a preliminary inquiry, the Board may publicly confirm the
existence of the inquiry, and, at its discretion, make public any documents
which were issued to either party.
   (G)   The Board shall make a determination based on its preliminary inquiry
whether the complaint is within its jurisdiction and, if so, whether it alleges
a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation of this chapter. If the Board
concludes that the complaint is outside of its jurisdiction, frivolous or
without factual basis, the Board shall immediately terminate the inquiry,
reduce the conclusion to writing, and transmit a copy of its decision to the
complainant and to all officers or employees against whom the complaint was
filed.
   (H)   If the Board of Ethics concludes, based upon its preliminary inquiry,
that the complaint is within its jurisdiction and contains allegations
sufficient to establish a minimal factual basis to constitute a violation, the
Board shall notify the officer or employee who is the subject of the complaint
and may:
      (1)   Due to mitigating circumstances such as, lack of significant
economic advantage or gain by the officer or employee, lack of economic loss to
the city and its taxpayers, or lack of significant impact on public confidence
in city government issue, in writing, a confidential reprimand to the officer
or employee concerning the alleged violation and provide a copy of the
confidential reprimand to the executive authority and governing body of the
city or city agency.
      (2)   Initiate a hearing to determine whether there has been a violation.
   (I)   If a complaint is accepted or prepared pursuant to division (A) above,
the Ethics Commission must conduct an investigation. From this point on, the
complainant may not withdraw his or her complaint, although he or she may
request that the Ethics Commission either make a finding of no probable cause
or no violation. Unless complainant retracts statements in the complaint that
they no longer believe them to be true.
   (J)   In conducting an investigation, the Board of Ethics may administer
oaths or affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, and require
the production of any books or records it deems relevant and material. The
Police Department and all city agencies, bodies, officials, and employees are
required to respond fully and truthfully to all enquiries and cooperate with
all requests of the Board of Ethics or its agents relating to an investigation.
It is a violation of this code for any official or employee to deny access to
information requested by the Board of Ethics in the course of an investigation
or a public hearing, except to the extent that such denial is required by
federal, state, or local law.
      (1)   Nothing in this section may be construed to permit the Board of
Ethics to conduct an investigation of itself or of any of its members or staff.
If the Board of Ethics receives a complaint alleging that the Board or any of
its members or staff has violated any provision of this code, or any other law,
the Board must promptly transmit to the legislative body a copy of the
complaint.
   (K)   Any person who knowingly files with the Board a false complaint
alleging a violation of any provision of this chapter by an officer or employee
of the city or any city agency shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.

policy for the Richmond Police Department prohibiting racial profiling.
   (B)   Definition. For purposes for this policy the following term shall have
the meanings specified unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
   RACIAL PROFILING. A process that motivates the initiation of a stop,
detention or search which is solely motivated by consideration of an
individual's actual or perceived race, color or ethnicity or making
discretionary decisions during the execution of law enforcement duties based on
the above stated considerations. Nothing shall preclude an officer from relying
on an individual's actual or perceived race, color or ethnicity as an element
in the identification of a suspect or in the investigation of a crime, a
possible crime or violation of law or statute.
   (C)   Policy. The protection and the preservation of the constitutional and
civil rights of individuals remains one of the paramount concerns of
government, and law enforcement in particular. To safeguard these rights, law
enforcement personnel shall not engage in any behavior or activity that
constitutes racial profiling. The decision of an officer to make a stop or
detain an individual or conduct a search shall not be solely motivated by
consideration of race, color or ethnicity. Stops, detentions or searches shall
be based on articulable reasonable suspicions, observed violations of law or
probable cause and shall comply with accepted constitutional and legal
provisions and with the Code and Cannon of Ethics adopted by the Kentucky Law
Enforcement Council through Peace Officer Professional Standards. This policy
shall be mandatory for all members of the Richmond Police Department.
   (D)   Training. All officers shall complete the Kentucky Law Enforcement
Council approved training related to racial profiling. Such training shall
comply with federal law, state statutory provisions, case law and other
applicable laws, regulations and established rules.
   (E)   Discipline. An officer who violates a provision of this policy shall
be subject to the agency's disciplinary procedures, which shall be consistent
with other penalties imposed for similar officer misconduct.

34.01 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $250
and jailed for not more than 90 days or both. Each day's violation is
considered a separate offense.

of Codes Enforcement.
    (B)   (1)   Hear and decide cases arising under § 113 of the International

structures so deteriorated or dilapidated or so out of repair as to be
dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise unfit for human habitation or
occupancy within the meaning of § 113 of the IPMC. The issues before the Board
shall be: (i) whether the condition of the structure in question is as is set
forth in the said § 113 of the IPMC and, if so, (ii) whether it is reasonable
to repair the structure or whether the structure should be demolished. The
city's Department of Codes Enforcement shall issue such notice to the property
owner regarding the structure as is mandated by the IPMC, and should the time

human habitation or occupancy, the Board shall enter an order which permits the
property owner to do so, but which in addition sets forth the parameters within
which such repairs shall be commenced, performed, and completed. If in any
subsequent hearing involving the same structure and property owner the Board

however, that any fine shall be within the parameters prescribed by ordinance
for the violation.

citation by:

   (C)   A code enforcement officer may, in lieu of immediately issuing a
citation, give notice that a violation shall be remedied within a specified
period of time. If the person to whom the notice is given fails to remedy the
violation within the time specified, the code enforcement officer is authorized
to issue a citation.
   (D)   The citation issued by the code enforcement officer shall contain the

committed shall be final and the alleged violator shall be deemed to have
waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court.

violation was committed. If the Board shall find that no violation was

so finding and may order the offender to do either or both of the following:

fund, the city's rate of contribution shall be at least 12% of the salaries of
the active members participating in the fund.
      (2)   An amount resulting from the application of a rate percent of the

(Ord. 87-26, passed 7-28-87)
§ 36.092 RETIREMENT.
   (A)   Voluntary retirement.
      (1)   Any member may, at his option, retire on a service retirement
annuity upon or after attainment of the age of 50 years, provided he shall have
completed at least 20 years of total service. Upon fulfillment of these terms,
it is mandatory that the Board shall grant the retirement annuity upon receipt
of the application of said member.
      (2)   Any member who was a member on July 16, 1986 may retire on a
service retirement annuity on or before the attainment of age 50 and at that

least 20 years of total service.
   (B)   Compulsory retirement. Each member shall be subject to compulsory
retirement according the rules of the city; provided, however, that any member
able to perform his assigned duties shall not be precluded from serving at
least 20 years.
(Ord. 87-26, passed 7-28-87)
§ 36.093 RETIREMENT ANNUITY.
   (A)   The rate of retirement annuity shall be 2½% of average salary, as
defined in KRS 95.851(13), for each year of total service up to and including
30 years, subject to a maximum of 75% of average salary. Fractional periods of
service shall be considered in the calculation of such annuities according to
the aforesaid rate.
   (B)   Any member who retired prior to June 21, 1974 shall receive an
increase of $10 per month for each year or part thereof of retirement prior to
June 21, 1974, with a maximum increase of $170 per month. No surviving widow of

Security benefits are increased the surviving widow's minimum shall be
increased by a like percentage, but the pension increase shall not exceed 5%.
   (C)   Within six months after the performance of the actuarial study
required by KRS 95.872(6), the rate of retirement annuity of each annuitant
shall be increased annually by an amount determined by the study to reflect so
much of the annual increase in the cost of living of the annuitant as may be
supported on an actuarial sound basis by the fund. So long as the same is
published, such studies shall rely on the “All Items Index” of the United
States Department of Labor's Consumer Price Indexes, but no increase in the
cost of living shall exceed 5% or the actual increase in the cost of living,
whichever is lower. The increases shall be payable only after the member has
been retired for a period of three full years, and all increases granted on
July 15, 1990 or thereafter shall be compounded.

§ 36.094 BENEFITS TO SURVIVING WIDOW, MINOR CHILDREN, PARENTS OF MEMBERS WHOSE
DEATH WAS DUE TO OCCUPATIONAL CAUSES.
   (A)   Upon death of a member due to occupational causes, regardless of
length of service, his surviving widow shall be entitled immediately upon
cessation of salary to an annuity equal to 50% of the members last rate of
salary. This annuity shall be payable until she dies or remarries. No surviving
widow shall receive an annuity of less than $150 per month. When social
security benefits are increased the minimum shall be increased by a like
percentage, provided the increase shall not exceed 5%. In addition, if minor
children, under age of 18, survive the member, the widow shall receive on
account of each child 10% of the members last salary until each child attains
age 18. The combined payments to a widow and minor children shall not exceed
75% of his final rate of salary.
   (B)   If a widow does not survive the member, or if she remarries, and minor
children under age 18 exist, each child shall be entitled to an annuity equal
to 15% of the member's last rate of salary until each child attains age 18,
provided that the combined payments to such children shall not exceed 50% of
the member's last rate of salary.
   (C)   If neither a widow nor minor children, eligible for benefits survive
the member, each dependent parent shall be entitled to an annuity equal to 25%
of the members last rate of salary, or 50% to both parents.
   (D)   If a widow would receive from a combination of:
      (1)   Survivor benefits pursuant to this section, excluding benefits for
minor children; and
      (2)   Worker's Compensation benefits, excluding dependent children's
allowance or payment for medical expense or legal fees related to the Worker's
Compensation claim, an amount greater than 100% of the deceased member's last
rate of salary, then the pension system survivor benefits shall be reduced to
the point that the combined payment equal 100% of the last rate of salary. The
survivor benefit shall not be reduced, however, below an amount equal to 2½% of
average salary for each year of the deceased member's service. Any reduction in
the survivor payment shall be based upon Worker's Compensation benefits
applicable at the time the survivor payment is granted, and not upon subsequent
increases in either benefit. If Worker's Compensation benefits are reduced at a
subsequent time, the surviving spouse shall inform the Board and the Board
shall increase the survivor's benefit by the amount of the reductions, not by
more than an amount which would increase the survivor's benefit to 50% of last
rate of salary. The Board of Trustees may pay estimated benefits until such
amounts are actually determined at which time a final calculation of the
spouse's actual benefits shall be determined and the account corrected
retroactive to the effective date of the survivor benefit. If Worker's
Compensation benefits are paid in lump sums, the Board shall reduce the
survivor benefit on the monthly rather than a lump sum basis. The amount of the
monthly reduction shall be based upon the life expectancy of the survivor. The
Board may request the assistance of the general manager of the Kentucky
Retirement Systems to calculate the reduction in survivor benefits when lump
sum payments are involved, and the general manager shall provide such
assistance upon request.
(Ord. 87-26, passed 7-28-87)
§ 36.095 BENEFITS TO SURVIVING WIDOW AND MINOR CHILDREN OF MEMBER WHOSE DEATH
WAS NOT OCCASIONED BY PERFORMANCE OF DUTY.
   (A)   Upon death of a member occurring while in service, arising from any
cause other than in the performance of duty, provided the member has had at
least three years of total service his widow shall receive an annuity equal to
1½% of average salary for each year of total service, credited to the member,
subject to a maximum payment to the widow of 50%. If the member has had at
least 10 years total service, the widow shall receive an annuity of not less
than $150 per month, and when social security benefits are increased the
minimum shall be increased by a like percentage, but the increase shall not
exceed 5%. Payment of the annuity shall be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The widow has been married to the member at least one year prior to
his death;
      (2)   The widow is at least 45 years of age, otherwise payment will be
deferred until she attains such age, except that if she is or becomes totally
disabled before age 45, or has a minor child or children by the member in her
care under age 18 (including adopted children provided the proceedings for
adoption were initiated at least one year prior to death of member) payment of
the widow's annuity will begin immediately together with an additional
allowance on account of the child or children;
      (3)   The widow's annuity will terminate in any event when the widow
remarries. The annuity of each child or children shall continue until each
child attains age 18.
   (B)   If the widow has minor children under age of 18, the annuity to the
widow shall be increased one-half on account of the first child and one-fourth
on account of each additional child, subject to a maximum combined payment to
the widow and children of 75% of the average salary as defined in §
36.086.
   (C)   If the pensioner is not survived by a widow and there are minor
children the following benefits shall be paid:
      (1)   One minor child, 50%;
      (2)   Two minor children, 15% additional;
      (3)   Three or more minor children, 10% additional, subject to a maximum
combined payment of 75% of the average salary as defined in §
36.086. The annuity of each child or children shall continue until each child
attains age 18, or, in the case of a child regularly employed in full-time
educational activities the age of 23. The annuity payments shall be reduced in
reverse order.
   (D)   These benefits shall also be payable upon death of the member while on
retirement, provided marriage was in effect for at least one year before
retirement.
(Ord. 87-26, passed 7-28-87)
§ 36.096 ANNUITY RATE FOR PERMANENT OCCUPATIONAL DISABILITY.
   (A)   In the event a total and permanent occupational disability occurs, the
member shall receive an annuity equal to 70% of his last rate of salary. This
benefit shall begin at such time as his salary may cease, and shall be paid
during his entire lifetime. Any member who retired prior to June 21, 1974 shall
receive an increase of $10 per month for each year or part thereof of
retirement prior to June 21, 1974, with a maximum increase of $170 per month.
Upon his death, his eligible widow and minor children, if any, shall receive
the benefits as provided in §
36.094.
   (B)   If the member retired for total and permanent occupational disability
would receive from a combination of pension disability payments pursuant to
division (A) of this section, and Workers' Compensation payment excluding
spouse or dependent children's allowances or payment for medical expense or
legal fees related to the Workers' Compensation claim, an amount greater than
100% of his last rate of salary, then the pension system benefits shall be
reduced to the point that the combined payments equal 100% of the last rate of
salary. The benefit shall not be reduced, however, below an amount equal to 2½%
of average salary for each year of the member's service. Any reduction in the
payment shall be based upon Workers' Compensation benefits applicable at the
time the payment is granted, and not upon subsequent increases in either
benefit. If Worker's Compensation benefits are reduced at a subsequent time,
the retiree shall inform the Board, and the Board shall increase the benefit by
the amount of the reductions, but not by more than the amount which would
increase the benefit 70% of the last rate of salary. The Board of Trustees may
pay estimated benefits to a retiree, upon qualification for the benefits, based
upon an estimate of Workers' Compensation benefits until such amounts are
actually determined, at which time a final calculation of the actual benefits
shall be determined and the account corrected retroactive to the effective date
of the benefit. If Workers' Compensation benefits are paid in lump sums, the
Board shall reduce the disability retirement annuity on a monthly rather than a
lump sum basis. The amount of the monthly reduction shall be based upon the
life expectancy of the retired member. The Board may request the assistance of
the general manager of Kentucky Retirement Systems to calculate the reduction
in the retirement benefit when lump sum payments are involved, and the general
manager shall provide such assistance upon request.
(Ord. 87-26, passed 7-28-87)
§ 36.097 DISABILITY RETIREMENT ANNUITY FOR TOTAL AND DISABILITY NOT OCCASIONED
BY MEMBER'S DUTIES.
   (A)   Upon total and permanent disability of a member as the result of any
cause other than occupational disability, if a member shall have rendered at
least 10 years of total service, he shall be entitled to a disability
retirement annuity. The amount of such annuity shall be equal to 2½% of average
salary, as defined in §
36.086, for each full year of total service, subject to a minimum payment of
25% of such average salary, and a maximum payment of 50% of average salary.
Payment of this annuity shall be made during disability of the member. Any
member who retired prior to June 21, 1974 shall receive an increase of $10 per
month for each year of part thereof of retirement prior to June 21, 1974 with a
maximum increase of $170 per month. Upon death of the member, if an eligible
widow or minor children survive, such survivors shall be entitled to the
regular annuity provided under §
36.095.
   (B)   Any annuity for nonoccupational disability shall begin to accrue upon
the expiration of 90 days following the commencement of disability provided
that if the member is receiving salary for sick leave for a period of more than
90 days, payment shall accrue from the date such salary ceases. If written
application for such annuity shall not have been filed with the Board prior to
the expiration of 90 days from the date of disability, the annuity shall begin
to accrue from the date the application shall be filed but not prior to the
expiration of 90 days from the date of disability, nor in any event prior to
the time when salary payments to the employee shall have ceased.
(Ord. 87-26, passed 7-28-87)
§ 36.098 DETERMINATION OF DISABILITY.
   (A)   For the purpose of this subchapter a member shall be considered
totally and permanently disabled after the Board shall have received written
certification by at least two licensed and practicing physicians selected by
the Board that the member is totally and likely to be permanently disabled for
the further performance of the duties of any assigned position in the service
of the department. If upon consideration of the report of such physicians and
such other evidence as shall have been presented to it by the member of other
interest therein, the Board finds the member to be totally and permanently
disabled, it shall grant him a disability retirement annuity upon written
certification that the member has been separated from the service of the city
because of total disability of such nature as to reasonably prevent further
service for the employer, and as a consequence is not entitled to compensation
from the city.
   (B)   If, after the Board grants a police officer or firefighter a
disability retirement annuity, the Board determined that a police officer so
retired is performing police work for another employer, or that a fire fighter
so retired is performing fire fighting duties for another employer, and that
the duties performed for the new employer are substantially the same as those
which the retired member performed for the city, then the Board may terminate
the retired member's disability retirement annuity.
   (C)   If the Board terminates a retired member's disability retirement
annuity pursuant to division (B) of this section, the city shall offer the
member reemployment with the Police or Fire Department in order that the member
may, if he chooses, complete the service required for normal retirement. Time
spent in disability retirement shall not count as service credit for normal
retirement.
   (D)   A retired member aggrieved by termination of his disability retirement
annuity may appeal the decision of the Board to the Circuit Court of the County
in which the Board is located. The scope of the appeal shall be limited to
whether the Board abused its discretion in terminating the retirement benefit.
(Ord. 87-26, passed 7-28-87)
§ 36.099 WITHDRAWAL FROM SERVICE.
   Any member who withdrawals from service prior to age of 50 years after
having completed at least 20 years of total service, and who does not accept a
refund of contribution shall receive, upon application, a certificate entitling
him to a service retirement annuity upon his attainment of age 50, and
specifying the amount of the annuity earned and accrued at the date of
withdrawal from service.
(Ord. 87-26, passed 7-28-87)
§ 36.100 WITHDRAWAL FROM SERVICE PRIOR TO RETIREMENT.
   (A)   Upon withdrawal from service prior to retirement, a member shall be
entitled to receive a refund of the amount of contributions made by the member
after the date of establishment, including those employee contributions picked
up by the employer pursuant to KRS 65.155, without interest.
   (B)   Any member receiving a refund of contributions shall thereby ipso
facto forfeit, waive and relinquish all accrued rights and benefits in the
system, including all credited and creditable service. The Board may, in its
discretion, regardless of cause, withhold payment of a refund for a period not
to exceed six months after receipt of an application from a member.
   (C)   Any member who has received a refund shall be considered a new member
upon subsequent re-employment if such person qualifies for membership under the
provisions hereof. After the completion of at least five years of continuous
membership service following his latest reemployment, such member shall have
the right to make a repayment to the system of the amount or amounts previously
received as refund, including 6% interest from the dates of refund to the date
of repayment. Such repayment shall not be pickup up by the employer pursuant to
KRS 65.155. Upon the restoration of such refunds, as herein provided, such
member shall have reinstated to his account all credited service represented by
the refunds of which repayment has been made. Repayment of refunds by any
member shall include all refunds received by a member prior to the date of his
last withdrawal from service and shall be made in a single sum.
(Ord. 87-26, passed 7-28-87)
§ 36.101 DEATH BENEFIT WHERE NO WIDOW'S ANNUITY OR CHILDREN'S ANNUITIES ARE
PAYABLE.
   (A)   Upon death of a member, occurring while in active service, if no
widow's annuity or children's annuities are payable, the designated beneficiary
of the member or his estate shall be entitled to a death benefit equal to the
total contributions made by the member, including those employee contributions
picked up by the employer pursuant to KRS 65.155, without interest, or $300
whichever is greater.
   (B)   Upon death of a retired member, if no widow's annuity or children's
annuities shall be due or payable, a death benefit shall be paid to the
designated beneficiary or estate of the member, equal to the excess, if any, of
the total contributions made by the member to this fund to the date of
retirement, including those employee contributions picked up by the employer
pursuant to KRS 65.155, without interest, over the total annuity payments
received by the member. The minimum payment in such case shall be $300. If a
widow's annuity or children's annuities are payable after the death of the
retired member, the amount of such death benefit, if any, shall be determined
upon termination of annuity payments to all survivors of the member, whether
such termination occurs by death, remarriage or other cause.

operating experience of the fund, including a study of the rates, mortality,
disability, retirement, separations from service and other essential factors.
The actuary shall recommend all mortality and interest tables to be adopted by

of any county in which the city is located.

annuity, disability retirement annuity, or survivor's benefit, the accumulated

for membership service for the fiscal years next following the date of such
valuation. Any deficiency in this reserve shall be removed by an increase in
the amount of city's contributions for future membership service.

   (B)   (1)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall
be available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency

required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.
      (2)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not
less than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one color on white paper, or for
electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public agency maintains

nonexempt public records requested for use for noncommercial purposes which
shall not exceed the actual cost of reproduction, including the costs of the
media and any mechanical processing cost incurred by the public agency, but not
including the cost of staff required. If a public agency is asked to produce a
record in a nonstandardized format, or to tailor the format to meet the request
of an individual or a group, the public agency may at its discretion provide
the requested format and recover staff costs as well as any actual costs
incurred.
   (B)   (1)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee.
      (2)   The public agency from which copies of nonexempt public records are
requested for a commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the
requestor stating the commercial purpose for which they shall be used, and may
require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract
shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a
specified fee.
      (3)   The fee provided for in division (B)(1) of this section may be
based on one or both of the following:
         (a)   Cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing, and
staff required to produce a copy of the public record or records;

the public record for a different commercial purpose; or

publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its express permission for
that commercial use.

10.99
§ 39.15 ONLINE ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS IN ELECTRONIC FORM.

made available at the discretion of the public agency. If a party wishes to
access public records by electronic means and the public agency agrees to
provide online access, a public agency may require that the party enter into a
contract, license, or other agreement with the agency, and may charge fees for
these agreements.
   (B)   Fees shall not exceed:
      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and reasonable cost

wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the
system;
      (3)   To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
      (4)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system; and
      (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system.
   (C)   This subchapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits
to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements
for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires
user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
   (D)   This subchapter shall apply to the city and to persons outside the
city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of city publicly
owned treatment works (POTW). Except as otherwise provided herein, the

and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated and analytical
methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the
administrator;
         (g)   The Control Authority may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for pretreatment measures;
         (h)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
      (6)   Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user and certified to by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O
& M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet
the pretreatment standards and requirements; and
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O & M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which
the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O & M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
      (8)   Compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards.
The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by division (C)
(7) of this section:
         (a)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
(e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final
plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction,
completing construction, and the like).
         (b)   No increment referred to in division (C)(8)(a) of this section
shall exceed nine months.
         (c)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the scheduled and
the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress
report to the Control Authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the
date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason
for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the
construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine
months elapse between such progress reports to the Control Authority.
      (9)   Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
industrial users subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the Control Authority a report containing the information described
in division (C)(1) through (8) of this section. For industrial users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Control Authority in
accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR § 403.6(c), this report shall contain
a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production rate. For all other
industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure
of operation), this report shall include the user’s actual production during
the appropriate sampling period.
      (10)   Periodic reports on continued compliance.
         (a)   Any industrial users subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the
case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall
submit to the Control Authority during the months of June and December, unless
required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or the Control Authority
or the Approval Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical pretreatment
standards, In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the
discharge reported in division (C)(5) of this section except that the Control
Authority may require more detailed reporting of flows. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP)
or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation
required by the Superintendent or the pretreatment standard necessary to
determine compliance. At the discretion of the Control Authority and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, and the like, the Control Authority may agree to alter the months
during which above reports are to be submitted.
         (b)   Where the Control Authority has imposed mass limitations on
industrial users as provided for by CFR § 403.6(d) the report required by
division (C)(10)(a) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants
regulated by pretreatment standards in the discharge from the industrial user.
         (c)   For Industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the Control Authority in accordance with the procedures
in CFR § 403.6(c), the report required by this division (C)(10) shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production rate. For all other
industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only
in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), the report required by this division (C)(10) shall
include the user’s actual average production rate for the reporting period.
      (11)   Net/gross calculations. Categorical pretreatment standards may be
adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user’s intake
water in accordance with the following:
         (a)   Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the Superintendent. Upon request of the
industrial user, the applicable pretreatment standard will be calculated on a
“net” basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake
water) if the requirements of division (C)(11)(b) of this section are met:
         (b)   Criteria.
            1.   The industrial user must demonstrate that the control system
is proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards
would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of
pollutants in intake waters.
            2.   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease will not be
granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the
generic measure in the user’s effluent are substantially similar to the
constituents of the generic measure in the intake water, or unless appropriate
additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall
or elsewhere.
            3.   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value
equal to influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
            4.   Credit shall only be granted if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into the POTW
discharges. The Superintendent may waive this requirement if he or she finds
that no environmental degradation will result.
      (12)   Notice of potential problems, including slug loading. All
categorical and non-categorical industrial users shall notify the POTW
immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including
any slug loadings, as defined by 40 CFR § 403.5(b), by the industrial users.
      (13)   Monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance.
         (a)   The reports required in division (C)(10) of this section shall
contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the
flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested
by the Control Authority of pollutants contained therein which are limited by
the applicable pretreatment standards.
         (b)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a
violation, the user shall notify the Control Authority within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
         (c)   The reports required in division (C)(10) of this section shall
be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period. The Control Authority shall
require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance
by the industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
         (d)   All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the administrator pursuant to § 304(h) of the Act and contained
in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures
approved by the administrator. (See, 40 CFR §§ 136.4 and 136.5). Sampling shall
be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator.
Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for
the pollutants in question, or where the administrator determines that the Part
136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed using validated analytical
methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the POTW or other parties approved by the administrator. All
wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept
clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user
to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for
the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
         (e)   Except as indicated in divisions (C)(13)(f) and (g) below, the
user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by Richmond Utilities, the samples must
be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by Richmond
Utilities as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous limits.
         (f)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
         (g)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-
day compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, [the Superintendent] may
authorize a lower minimum. For periodic compliance reports, the industrial user
is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and
assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (h)   If an Industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in
division (C)(10) of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the Control Authority, using the procedures prescribed in division
(C)(5) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
      (14)   Conversion to equivalent limitations.
         (a)   When limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Control
Authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed as either
mass of pollutant discharged per day of effluent limitations applicable to
Individual industrial users. Any equivalent limitations under this section
shall be calculated according to 40 CFR § 403.6(c).
         (b)   Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism
incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a
production based standard shall notify the control Authority within two
business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production
level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not
notifying the Control Authority of such anticipated change will be required to
meet the mass or concentration limits in its control mechanism that were based
on the original estimate of the long term average production rate.
      (15)   Reporting requirements for industrial users not subject to
categorical pretreatment standards. Industrial users with discharges that are
not subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit compliance
reports periodically. The reporting format and frequency shall be a condition
of the wastewater contribution permit. The compliance report must be based on
data obtained during the period covered by the report and on an amount of
samples appropriate for that particular industrial user.
      (16)   Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall
promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or
character of pollutants in their discharge.
      (17)   Signatory requirements for industrial user reports. The reports
required by divisions (C)(10) through (14) of this section shall include the
certification statement as set forth in § 403.6(a)(2)(h), and shall be signed
as follows:
         (a)   By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user
submitting the reports required by divisions (C)(10) through (14) of this
section is a corporation. For the purpose of this division, a RESPONSIBLE
CORPORATE OFFICER means (i) a president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-
president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any
other persons who performs similar policy- or decision-making functions for the
corporation, or (ii) the manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or
operation facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual
sales or expenditures exceeding $25,000,000 (in second quarter 1980 collars),
if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in
accordance with corporate procedures.
         (b)   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user
submitting the reports required by divisions (C)(10) through (14) of this
section is a partnership or sole proprietorship respectively.
         (c)   By a duly authorized representative of the individual described
in subdivisions (a) or (b) of this subdivision (17) if:
            1.   The authorization is made in writing by the individual
described in subdivision (a) or (b) of this subdivision (17);
            2.   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well, or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent
responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matter for
the company;
            3.   The written authorization is submitted to the Control
Authority.
            4.   If an authorization under division (C)(17)(c) of this section
is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization
satisfying the requirements of division (C)(17)(c) of this section must be
submitted to the Control Authority prior to or together with any reports to be
signed by an authorized representative.
      (18)   Record-keeping requirements. Any industrial user subject to the
reporting requirements in this section shall maintain records of all
information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section.
Such records shall include for all samples:
         (a)   The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the
names of the person or persons taking the samples;
         (b)   The dates analyses were performed;
         (c)   Who performed the analysis;
         (d)   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
         (e)   The results of each analyses.
      (19)   Any industrial users subject to the reporting requirements

years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such
monitoring activities are required by this section) and shall make such records
available for inspection and copying by the director and the regional
administrator (and POTW in the case if an industrial user). This period of
retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation
regarding the industrial users or when requested by the director or regional
administrator.
      (20)   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance
shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
subchapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices. Records shall
include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of
the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user or Richmond Utilities, or where
the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Superintendent.
      (21)   Provisions governing fraud and false statements. The reports
required by this section are subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1001

§ 53.077 CHOICE OF MONITORING LOCATION.
   (A)   Where a treated regulated process wastestream is combined prior to
treatment with wastewaters other than generated by the regulated process, the
industrial user may monitor either the segregated process wastestream or the
combined wastestream for the purpose of determining compliance with applicable
standards. If the industrial user chooses to monitor the segregated process
wastestream, it shall apply the applicable categorical pretreatment standard.
If the user chooses to monitor the combined wastestream, it shall apply an
alternative discharge limit calculated using the combined wastestream formula
as provided in 40 CFR § 403.7.
   (B)   The industrial user may change monitoring points only after receiving
approval from the Control Authority. Any change in an industrial user’s
monitoring points shall not allow user to substitute dilution for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with applicable standards.

   (A)   The city shall require significant users to provide and operate at the
user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and
flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage system. The
monitoring facility should normally be suited on the user’s premises, but the
city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in a public right-of-way. The
Superintendent shall review and approve the location, plans, and specifications
for such monitoring facilities and may require them to be constructed to
provide for the separate monitoring and sampling of industrial waste and
sanitary sewage flows.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
approval of the location, plans and specifications.

§ 53.080 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether
the purpose of this subchapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, copying records, records examination or in the performance of any of
their duties.
   (B)   The city, Approval Authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into user’s premised, the user shall make necessary
arrangements for security so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the city, Approval Authority and EPA will be permitted to enter,
without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.

§ 53.081 PRETREATMENT.
   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply
with this subchapter and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical
pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal
pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a
level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be
acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the city under the provisions of this subchapter. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user’s initiation of changes.

permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall
be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction
unless the user specifically requests in writing and is able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge
information, process, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the user.
   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this subchapter, the
NPDES/KPDES permit, sludge disposal system permit, and/or the pretreatment

§ 53.092 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The following schedule of rates shall apply to each user of the
sewerage treatment system. This schedule includes rates for user charges and
rates for debt service charges, each based on the volume of metered water
consumption. There are two classes of sewer users, those classes having been
established by city ordinance No. 78-8 pursuant to KRS 96.912-96.924.
   (B)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      CHARGES FOR DEBT SERVICE. Charges levied on users of the sewage treatment
system to support the annual debt service obligations of the system.
      EXCESSIVE STRENGTH SURCHARGES. Charges levied on users of the sewage
treatment system whose contribution contains pollutants in concentrations which
exceed limits specified herein for such pollutants.
      SEWER SERVICE CHARGES. Charges levied on all users who discharge, cause
or permit the discharge of sewage into the public sewage treatment system.
      USER CHARGES. Charges levied on users of the sewage system to offset the
cost of operations and maintenance of the system.
   (C)   (1)   Phase V. The rates for each class of sewer user, based on
metered water consumption, on bills mailed after July 1, 2018 are as follows:
 
Class I — Inside City Limits:
Water Consumption — Inside City - Rates Per Month
Water Consumption       User Charge
First 300 cu. ft./mo.   $26.51 (min.)
Next 400 cu. ft./mo.    $7.98 per 100 cu. ft.
Next 5,000 cu. ft./mo.  $7.21 per 100 cu. ft.
Next 5,000 cu. ft./mo.  $6.45 per 100 cu. ft.
Over 10,700 cu. ft./mo. $5.71 per l00 cu. ft.
 
 
Class II - Outside the City Limits:
Water Consumption - Outside City - Rates Per Month
Water Consumption       User Charge
First 300 cu. ft./mo.   $53.03 (min.)
Next 400 cu. ft./mo.    $15.96 per 100 cu. ft.
Next 5,000 cu. ft./mo.  $14.45 per 100 cu. ft.
Next 5,000 cu. ft./mo.  $12.85 per 100 cu. ft.
Over 10,700 cu. ft./mo. $11.42 per l00 cu. ft.
 
 
Wholesale Sanitation District Customers
Flat Rate: $8.74 per 100/cubic feet of measured wastewater flow.
 
      (2)   Sewer rates provided in division (C)(1) of this section are based
on the underlying assumption that 90% of all metered water consumption is
eventually returned to the sewage treatment system. Where is can be evidenced
that the proportion of metered water consumption actually returned to the
treatment system by an individual customer is significantly different from 90%,
service charges shall be determined on the basis of measured or estimated
wastewater discharge. In this event, service charges shall be computed by
applying rates shown in division (C)(1) of this section plus 11%. The city
reserves the right to determine by whatever means and methods it may find
practicable, the amount of water consumption and/or wastewater discharge that
shall be used to compute sewer service charges.
      (3)   In the event discharges wastes to the sewage works having an
average biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) content in excess of 225 mg/l, and/or
an average suspended solids (SS) content in excess of 265 mg/l, and or an
average ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) content in excess of 25 mg/l, the user shall
pay a surcharge based upon the excess strength of its wastes.
      (4)   If the Controlling Authority (CA) during investigative grab
sampling discovers an industrial user discharging a slug of wastewater higher
in strength then the allowable limits for the surcharge parameters of BOD, TSS,
and NH3-N, then the following steps are to be taken:
         (a)   A surcharge fee of 10% of the normal surcharge fee will be
assessed.
         (b)   The industrial user will implement composite sampling of not
less than one ounce per month and not more than once per day based on direction
of the Control Authority.
         (c)   If surcharge parameter violations are chronic as opposed to slug
loading, all normal surcharge procedures and fees are to remain in effect.
      (5)   The following surcharge rates shall apply to each user of the
sewage works that contributes excessive strength sewage.
 
Surcharge Rates
BOD   $0.35 per pound
SS    $0.29 per pound
NH3-N $1.25 per pound
 
   (D)   Method of billing.
      (1)   Sewer service charge shall be billed monthly on the basis of each
user’s monthly water consumption/sewage contribution and strength of discharge.
The excessive strength surcharge shall be based on the following formula, with
the total applied to the monthly bill of affected users:
      [A(D-255) + B(E-265) + C(F-25)] .006238 x G = Surcharge Payment ($/Mo.)
      Where formula components are as follows:
         (a)   Surcharge rate for BOD, in $/pound.
         (b)   Surcharge rate for SS, in $/pound.
         (c)   Surcharge for NH3-N, in $/pound.
         (d)   User’s average BOD concentration, in mg/l.
         (e)   User’s average SS concentration, in mg/l.
         (f)   User’s average NH3-N concentration, in mg/l.
         (g)   User’s monthly flow to sewage works, in 100 cubic feet.
      (2)   No reduction in sewage service charges, fees, or taxes shall be
permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the sewage
works contain less than 225 mg/l of BOD, 265 mg/l of SS or 25 mg/l of NH3-N.
   (E)   Rate review.
      (1)   The city shall review not less often than every two years the
sewage contribution of users, the total cost of operation and maintenance of
the sewage works, and user charges. User charges shall be revised as necessary
to accomplish the following:
         (a)   Maintain the proportionate distribution of operations and
maintenance costs among users of the treatment system.
         (b)   Generate sufficient revenues to offset costs associated with the
proper operation and maintenance of the sewage system.
      (2)   Excessive strength surcharges shall be reviewed at the time of and
in conjunction with the review of user charges. Surcharge rates shall be
revised where necessary to reflect current treatment and monitoring costs.

ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES
§ 53.120 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The Superintendent may without notice suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or a wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is
necessary, on the opinion of the Superintendent in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes
interference to the POTW or causes Richmond Water, Gas and Sewerage Works to
violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES permit.
   (B)   The Superintendent shall notify the user in writing of the suspension
and the reason therefore within 48 hours of the suspension, exclusive of
weekends and holidays.
   (C)   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, Richmond Water, Gas and Sewerage Works
shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or
endangerment to any individuals. A detailed written statement submitted by the
user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken
to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within 15 days
of the date of occurrence.

contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service only upon proof
satisfactory to the Superintendent of the elimination of the non-complying
discharge.

subject to the enforcement procedures, including fines and payment costs, as
described in this subchapter.

§ 53.130 TIMEFRAMES FOR RESPONSES.
   (A)   All violations will be identified and documented within five days of
receiving compliance information.
   (B)   Initial enforcement responses involving contact with industrial user
and requesting information on corrective or preventative action(s) will occur
within 15 days of violation detection.
   (C)   Follow-up actions for continuing or reoccurring violations will be
taken within 30 days of the initial enforcement response. For all continuing
violations, the response will include a compliance schedule.
   (D)   Violations which threaten health, properly or environmental quality
are considered emergencies and will receive immediate responses such as halting
the discharge or terminating service.
(Ord. 95-08, passed 3-7-95; Am. Ord. 11-30, passed 12-13-11; Am. Ord. 13-25,
passed 11-12-13)
§ 53.131 ENFORCEMENT RESPONSES.
   The enforcement alternatives, the procedures for implementing the different
responses, and the persons responsible for each response are as follow:
   (A)   Notice of violation (NOV). The NOV is authorized by §
53.121, and is issued as a response to any violation of a user’s permit or the
ordinance. The NOV may be issued by the Superintendent or the Assistant
Superintendent, who, along with laboratory technicians, bear the responsibility
for determining the existence of a violation. The existence of a violation
should be discovered within five working days of the receipt of monitoring
date, either that submitted by the permit holder or that independently acquired
by the POTW. The NOV informs the permit holder of the time allowed to remedy
the violation and instructs the permit holder to furnish to the superintendent
a written report detailing the reason for the violation and the method of
correction. The Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent will make any
appropriate decision regarding increased monitoring or reporting requirements
and notify the violator upon correction of the violation.
   (B)   Administrative fines. If a violation occurs and is not remedied within
the time allowed in the NOV, or if the POTW is required to suspend service on
an emergency basis, an administrative fine may be levied in an amount of not
less than $200 nor more than $1,000 per day, with each day of violation deemed
a separate event for purposes of levying the fine. It is the responsibility of
the Assistant Superintendent or the Superintendent to determine whether a
violation had been adequately remedied after a NOV or whether a fine is
appropriate, and to determine the proper amount of the fine, taking into
consideration such factors as the seriousness of the violation, any past
violations of this permit holder, the permit holder’s ability to prevent the
violation, and the good faith effort to correct the violation, and any other
appropriate factors.
   (C)   Revocation of permit; termination of sewer services. Section
53.123 allows the Superintendent to revoke the permit of any user which
continues a violation beyond the time slated in a NOV by notifying the user in
writing of his or her intention to revoke the permit with 14 days’ notice. The
permit may also be suspended without notice if necessary, in the opinion of the
Superintendent, to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, the environment, cause interference to the POTW or cause the POTW to
violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES permit. The existence of any of these
criteria also allows the Superintendent to suspend sewer service to any user
without prior notice.
   (D)   Civil action. Section
53.126 authorizes the POTW to commence legal action in any court of appropriate
jurisdiction for enforcement or collection of unpaid fines or for other
“appropriate relief” for improper discharges, including injunctive relief to
prohibit further discharges and damages, including costs and fees associated
with litigation. The individuals responsible for collecting evidence and
assisting legal counsel during any litigation including the Superintendent,
Assistant Superintendent for Sewer Systems, and laboratory technicians.

passed 11-12-13)
§ 53.132 MONITORING, TESTING, CHAIN-OF-CUSTODY AND TESTING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Monitoring. Four types of monitoring are utilized for purposes of
determining compliance with a user’s permit: scheduled, unscheduled, demand or
investigative monitoring, and industrial monitoring.
      (1)   Scheduled monitoring. The POTW, through appropriate personnel,
conducts systematic sampling and comprehensive inspection of significant
industrial contributors to the POTW in accordance with the predetermined permit
schedule.
      (2)   Unscheduled monitoring. The POTW conducts an unannounced check of
industrial discharges, to spot check randomly all sources within the collection
system.
      (3)   Investigative/demand monitoring. In response to suspend or known
violations of a permit, discovered through self-monitoring reports, routing
sampling, or public complaint, the Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent
may require immediate collection of samples for testing to verity compliance
with the permit. Sampling may be collected by POTW personnel or be required to
be collected by the industrial user.
      (4)   Industrial self-monitoring. Each industrial user, as a condition of
its permit, must collect samples for analysis on a frequency determined by the
permit. This frequency may range from annually to more than monthly, depending
on the industrial user, the history of compliance, the type of discharge, and
other factors. The Superintendent may also require testing more frequently than
stated in the permit as part of an enforcement action.
   (B)   Inspection. Prior to establishing a schedule for self-monitoring, an
inspection of the industrial user is performed by the Assistant Superintendent
for Sewer Systems to acquire an understanding of the specified industrial
processes and the wastestreams. Future on-site inspections are conducted
according to permit conditions, at least annually and more often if necessary.
Included in each inspection is an inspection of the industrial user’s self-
monitoring facility. A form entitled “inspection report” must be completed by
the Assistant Superintendent, with a copy provided to the appropriate personnel
of the industrial user. A copy of this form is attached hereto for reference.
   (C)   Chain of custody. To ensure the validity of samples, the POTW uses a
chain of custody document which accompanies the sample throughout the testing
process. A copy of this form is attached. Each person handling the sample must
indicate on the form when and by whom the sample is received.
   (D)   Testing procedures. All handling, preservation, measurement, testing,
and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall conform to the
methods and procedures set forth at 40 CFR Part 136, or methods approved by the
administrator of the EPA.

passed 11-12-13)
§ 53.133 PROCEDURE FOR ABATEMENT OF HARMFUL DISCHARGE.
   All harmful discharge shall be diverted to the equalization holding basin at
the POTW, where it is held until proper identification and proper treatment/
disposal methods can be ascertained and accomplished. Personnel responsible for
this procedure include the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent for Sewer
Systems, and the Chief Operator at the affected POTW.

SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE
§ 53.140 SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The city shall, at least annually, publish in the largest daily newspaper in
the municipality, a list of industrial users which during the previous 12
months, were significantly violating pretreatment standards or other
pretreatment requirements. For purposed of this subchapter, a violation is
significant if it meets one or more of the following criteria:
   (A)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all measurements taken during a six-month period
exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement
including instantaneous limits, as defined in §§
53.050 through
53.060;
   (B)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of all the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken
during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the pretreatment
standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined in §§
53.050 through
53.060 or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for
BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (C)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined in §§
53.050 through
53.060 (daily maximum or longer-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the Control Authority determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of the POTW personnel or the general public);
   (D)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW’s
exercise of its emergency authority under §§
53.120 through
53.133 to halt, or prevent such a discharge;
   (E)   Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order
for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
   (F)   Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
   (G)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; and
   (H)   Any other violation(s) which may include a violation of best
management practices which the Control Authority determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

   (A)   This subchapter shall be adopted pursuant to the powers granted and
limitations imposed by Kentucky laws, including the enforcement authority
granted to Kentucky cities in KRS 83A.065.
   (B)   This subchapter and all references made herein is adopted pursuant to
the powers granted and limitations imposed by the Federal Clean Water Act, and
in particular those parts that authorize local governments to require any state
or federal department or agency to comply with all local water pollution
control requirements.
   (C)   The Planning and Zoning Department for the City of Richmond and their
duly authorized designees are responsible for implementing all the provisions
within and referenced by this subchapter.
(Ord. 12-54, passed 12-11-12)
§ 53.176 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   (1)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this subchapter is to protect
the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the
regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer
system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This
subchapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants
into the municipal separate storm sewer system in order to comply with
requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit process. The objectives of this subchapter are to:
         (a)   Regulate the contribution of pollutants from stormwater
discharges to the MS4 system by any user;
         (b)   Prohibit illicit discharges and connections to the MS4;
         (c)   Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of
spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the MS4; and
         (d)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this subchapter.
      (2)   The requirements of this subchapter should be considered minimum
requirements, and where any provision of this subchapter imposes restrictions
different from those imposed by any other applicable ordinance, rule, or
regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more
restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the
environment shall be considered to take precedence.
   (B)   Applicability. The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to all
water entering the storm drain system generated on any developed and
undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the city or other authorized
enforcement agency.
   (C)   Compatibility with other regulations. This subchapter is not intended
to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, other provision of
law. The requirements of this subchapter are in addition to the requirements of
any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any
provision of this subchapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed
by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever
provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human
health or the environment shall control.
   (D)   Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph,
subdivision or clause of this subchapter shall be adjudged invalid by a court
of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the
remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this
subchapter.
(Ord. 12-54, passed 12-11-12)
§ 53.177 PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   Prohibition of illicit discharges.
      (1)   No person shall throw, drain, or otherwise discharge, cause, or
allow others under its control to throw, drain, or otherwise discharge into the
municipal separate storm sewer system or watercourses any materials, including
but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or
contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than
stormwater.
      (2)   The following discharges are exempt from the prohibition provision
above:
         (a)   Water line flushing performed by a government agency, other
potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream
flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains,
uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including
active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning
condensation, swimming pools, springs, natural riparian habitat or wetland
flows, and any other water source not containing pollutants (NOTE: swimming
pool water may be discharged only if dechlorinated - below 0.1 milligrams per
liter (mg/L), which can typically be achieved though discontinuing chlorination
for a minimum period of 48 hours);
         (b)   Discharges or flows from fire fighting, and other discharges
specified in writing by the city as being necessary to protect public health
and safety; and
         (c)   The prohibition provision above shall not apply to any non-
stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority
of the state and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the
discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver,
or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the MS4.
   (B)   Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, connection, use,
maintenance or continued existence of any illicit connection to the municipal
separate storm sewer system is prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person violates this subchapter if the person connects a line
conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.
      (3)   Improper connections in violation of this subchapter must be
disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved onsite wastewater
management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the Richmond
Utility Board.
      (4)   Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps
or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be
located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written
notice of violation from the City of Richmond requiring that such locating be
completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the
location of the drain or conveyance is to be completed, that the drain or
conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the
outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary
sewer system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these
investigations are to be documented and provided to the City Engineer.

§ 53.178 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
City Engineer prior to allowing discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 12-54, passed 12-11-12)
§ 53.179 ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF PROPERTIES AND FACILITIES.
   The City of Richmond and/or its personnel or authorized agents shall be
permitted to enter and inspect properties and facilities at reasonable times as
often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this subchapter.
   (A)   If a property or facility has security measures in force that require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the owner
or operator shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the city.
   (B)   The owner or operator shall allow the city ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, photography,
videotaping, examination and copying of any records that are required under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater.
   (C)   The city shall have the right to set up on any property or facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the City Engineer to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of flow discharges.
   (D)   The city may require the owner or operator to install monitoring
equipment and perform monitoring as necessary, and make the monitoring data
available to the city. This sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the owner
or operator at his/her own expense. All devices used to measure flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the owner or operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner
or operator.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a facility are a
violation of this subchapter.
   (G)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and the city is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or that
there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
environment and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a
search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 12-54, passed 12-11-12)
§ 53.180 NOTIFICATION OF ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES AND SPILLS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility, activity or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility, activity or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of pollutants or non-stormwater discharges from that facility
or operation which are resulting or may result in illicit discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4, Waters of the Commonwealth, or
Waters of the U.S., said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release so as to minimize the
effects of the discharge.
   (B)   In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by
phone, facsimile or in person of the nature, quantity and time of occurrence of
the discharge. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said
person shall notify the City of Richmond in person or by phone (859-623-1000)

   (A)   This subchapter is adopted pursuant to the powers granted and
limitations imposed by Kentucky laws, including the statutory authority granted
to Kentucky cities in KRS Chapters 67 and 100.
   (B)   This subchapter and all references made herein is adopted pursuant to
the powers granted and limitations imposed by the Federal Clean Water Act, and
in particular those parts that authorize local governments to require any state
or federal department or agency to comply with all local water pollution
control requirements.
   (C)   The Planning and Zoning Department for the City of Richmond and their
duly authorized designees are responsible for implementing all the provisions
within and referenced by this subchapter.
(Ord. 12-51, passed 12-11-12)
§ 53.201 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   The regulations set forth in this subchapter are intended to protect
the general health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city by
establishing a set of water quality and quantity policies to provide reasonable
guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff in all public and private
developments for the purpose of preserving local water resources from
degradation. This subchapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
      (1)   To protect and enhance the municipal separate storm sewer system
(MS4), community waters and waters of the Commonwealth;
      (2)   To maintain after development, as nearly as possible, the
predevelopment runoff characteristics, and to reduce stream channel erosion,
pollution, siltation and sedimentation, and local flooding;
      (3)   Improve stormwater quality through stormwater management controls
and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose
no threat to public safety; and
      (4)   To provide long-term responsibility for and maintenance of
stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP).
   (B)   These regulations for stormwater management apply to the development
or redevelopment of land for residential, commercial, industrial, or
institutional use, but do not apply to agricultural land management practices.
(Ord. 12-51, passed 12-11-12)
§ 53.202 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This subchapter shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan
applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the city
under the specifications of this subchapter and Stormwater Procedures Manual.
This subchapter also applies to land development activities that are smaller
than one acre if such activities are part of a larger common plan of
development as established in KPDES permit number KYG200000.
   (B)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in the Stormwater Procedures Manual, decisions
on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be made after a review
by the city. Each redevelopment project shall have no net increase in
imperviousness.
(Ord. 12-51, passed 12-11-12)
§ 53.203 UTILIZATION OF BMP RESOURCES.
   The city may furnish additional policy, criteria and information including
specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements
for this subchapter in the form of approved Best Management Practices (BMP),
which will be located in the city’s Stormwater Procedures Manual. The
Stormwater Procedures Manual will include a list of acceptable stormwater
treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and
maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. Stormwater treatment
practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and
sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance
standards. Until the development of this resource, information on stormwater
BMPs is available at EPAs National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices
(http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/).
(Ord. 12-51, passed 12-11-12)
§ 53.204 REQUIREMENTS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN APPROVAL.
   (A)   No application for development will be approved unless it includes a
stormwater management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water
quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed.
This plan must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on-site or off-site
and, if on-site, the general location and type of practices. The Stormwater
Procedures Manual outlines accepted design criteria and the information
required for submittal in the stormwater management plan.
   (B)   For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously developed
site, an applicant shall be required to include within the stormwater concept
plan, measures for controlling existing stormwater runoff discharges from the
site in accordance with the standards of this subchapter to the maximum extent
practicable.
   (C)   The stormwater management plan(s) must be signed by a licensed
professional engineer (PE), who will verify that the design of all stormwater
management practices meet the submittal requirements outlined in the Stormwater
Procedures Manual or EPAs National Menu of Stormwater Best Management
Practices, as applicable. No land disturbance permit shall be issued until a
satisfactory final stormwater management plan, or a waiver thereof, has been
reviewed and approved by the city. The review process will determine that the
plan or waiver is consistent with the requirements of this subchapter. By
approving a plan under this chapter, the city does not accept responsibility
for the design, installation, and operation and maintenance of stormwater BMPs.
(Ord. 12-51, passed 12-11-12; Am. Ord. 16-20, passed 8-9-16)
§ 53.205 MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS.

   Whenever the governing body of the city finds that a potential shortage of
water supply is indicated, it shall be empowered to declare by order that a
water shortage advisory exists, and that the Superintendent of the Water, Gas
and Sewerage Works shall, on a daily basis, monitor the supply and demands upon
that supply. In addition, the Mayor (or his/her agent) is authorized to call
upon all water customers to employ voluntary water conservation measures (see §
54.19) to limit water use (especially Class 3 uses) and eliminate the waste of
water. This order shall be published in the official city newspaper, and may be
publicized through the general news media or any other appropriate method for
making such orders public.
(Ord. 86-39, passed 10-22-86)
§ 54.13 DECLARATION OF A WATER SHORTAGE ALERT.
   Whenever the governing body of the city finds raw water supplies (i.e.,
streamflow, reservoir levels or groundwater levels) to be consistently below
seasonal averages, and if they continue to decline and may not be adequate to
meet normal needs, it shall be empowered to declare by order that a water
shortage alert exists. The city shall continue to encourage voluntary water
conservation measures defined under the advisory declaration, and further shall
impose a ban on all Class 3 water uses for the duration of the shortage until
it is declared to have ended by resolution of the governing body. Declaration
of these orders shall follow the guidelines for declaration in §
54.12 of this subchapter.
(Ord. 86-39, passed 10-22-86)
§ 54.14 DECLARATION OF A WATER SHORTAGE EMERGENCY.
   Whenever the governing body of the city finds that raw water supplies are
below the level necessary to meet normal needs and that serious shortages
exist, it shall be empowered to declare that a water shortage emergency exists.
Class 1, Essential Uses, shall be identified, in specific, as targets for
voluntary conservation initiatives. Also, all Class 2, Socially or Economically
Important Uses, shall be banned in addition to the Class 3, Non-Essential Uses.
These restrictions shall be considered ongoing until the emergency is declared
ended by order of the governing body. Declaration of these orders shall follow
the guidelines for declaration in §
54.12 of this subchapter.
(Ord. 86-39, passed 10-22-86)
§ 54.15 DECLARATION OF RATIONING.
   Whenever the governing body of the city finds a need to provide for the
equitable distribution of critically-limited water supplies, in order to
balance demand and limited available supplies, and to assure that sufficient
water is available to preserve public health and safety, it shall be empowered
to declare by order the adoption of mandatory rationing.
(Ord. 86-39, passed 10-22-86)
§ 54.16 OBJECTIVES OF RATIONING.
   (A)   It is imperative that water customers achieve an immediate further
reduction in water in order to extend existing water supplies and, at the same
time, assure that sufficient water is available to preserve the public health
and sanitation and to provide fire protection service.
   (B)   The immediate further reduction in water usage is another step along a
continuum of responses to the present water supply shortage. Should shortages
continue, further reductions in usage may be required. It must be emphasized
that the additional usage reduction in the rationed area is a valid and
attainable goal reflective of the conditions which currently exist.
   (C)   The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage and for
equal sacrifice on the part of each water customer. The success of this
subchapter depends on the cooperation of all water customers in the emergency
area.
(Ord. 86-39, passed 10-22-86)
§ 54.17 WATER USE RATIONING FOR RESIDENTIAL USERS.
   (A)   Metered residential water customers and allotments.
      (1)   The number of permanent residents in each dwelling unit (household)
will determine the amount of water that each household will be allowed.
      (2)   Each dwelling unit (household) shall be allotted 40 gallons per day
for each resident of the household. Households with only one permanent resident
will have a daily allotment of 55 gallons.
      (3)   Residential water customers are required to provide city and
utility personnel with reasonable access to read meters as necessary to enforce
this rationing declaration. Where access is not readily available, all
reasonable efforts to contact customers in order to arrange for access to read
meters shall be made. In the event a water customer does not allow entry to
read the meter after reasonable efforts to arrange for such access the dwelling
unit (household) allotment will be reduced to 55 gallons per day.
      (4)   (a)   Where the residential water allotment provided under this
section would create an extraordinary hardship, as in the case of special
health-related requirements, the water customer may apply to the city for an
exemption or variance from these requirements. If it is found that the
allotment provided in this section would impose an extraordinary hardship, a
revised allotment for the particular customer may be established.
         (b)   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an exemption
or variance rendered by a public utility or municipal corporation, may file a
complaint with the city's governing body in accordance with the city's
administrative procedures.
         (c)   In the case of rural water districts, appeals should be filed
with the state's Public Service Commission.
   (B)   Non-metered residential water customers and allotments.
      (1)   In order to effectively implement and monitor the residential water
conservation effort, a water allotment shall be established for the entire
water system based on the lesser of 40 gallons per day per capita served or 50%
of the water used by the entire system during March 1985.
      (2)   The city and the utility will establish a communication system with
the customers through public media to inform them of the requirements of the
water rationing provisions of this subchapter, possible conservation measures
that customers may employ, the system allotment, and a regularly scheduled
report of whether the usage was within the allotment.
   (C)   Metered and non-metered residential customers of the same water supply
system. Where a water supply system serves both metered and non-metered
residential customers, the allotments and procedures provided under both
divisions (A) and (B) shall be applied, as appropriate.
   (D)   Suggested conservation measures. See §
54.19.
(Ord. 86-39, passed 10-22-86)
§ 54.18 WATER USE RATIONING FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL WATER USERS.
   (A)   Non-residential customers include commercial, industrial,
institutional, public and all other such users, with the exception of hospitals
and health care facilities.
   (B)   Non-residential water customers shall further reduce their water usage
to the lesser of 40 gallons per person per day or to 50% of use levels during
March 1985, or the last recorded use level if no meter readings record the rate
of the customers' use on March, 1985.
   (C)   It is the primary responsibility of each non-residential water
customer to meet its mandated water use reduction goal in whatever manner
possible.
   (D)   The city may establish a water allotment for each non-residential
water customer, based upon a required further reduction of water usage from the
allotment established by reference to division (B) of this section.
   (E)   Each non-residential water user shall provide access to city personnel
for purposes of meter reading and monitoring of compliance with this
subchapter. All reasonable efforts will be made to contact customers to arrange
for access.
   (F)   (1)   If the mandated further reduction in water usage cannot be
obtained without imposing extraordinary hardships which threatens health and
safety, the non-residential customer may apply to the city for a variance. For
these purposes EXTRAORDINARY HARDSHIP means a permanent damage to property or
economic loss which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne by
other water users subject to this water rationing subchapter. If the further
reduction would cause an extraordinary hardship or threaten health or safety, a
variance may be granted and a revised water use reduction requirement for the
particular customer may be established.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such a variance
rendered by a public utility or municipal corporation may file a complaint with
the city's governing body in accordance with the city's administrative
procedures.
      (3)   In the case of rural water districts, appeals should be filed with
the state's Public Service Commission.
   (G)   The city will provide each non-residential customer with suggested
means to reduce usage levels (see §
54.19).

54.99
§ 54.19 CONSERVATION MEASURES FOR DIRECT RESIDENTIAL AND NON- RESIDENTIAL
USERS.
   (A)   Direct residential users to adopt the following conservation measures.
      (1)   Locate and repair all leaks in faucets, toilets, and water-using
appliances.
      (2)   Adjust all water-using appliances to use the minimum amount of
water in order to achieve the appliance's purpose.
      (3)   Use automatic washing machines and dishwashers only with full
loads.
      (4)   Take shorter showers and shallower baths.
      (5)   Turn off faucets while brushing teeth, and the like.
      (6)   Turn off shower while soaping up.
      (7)   Set temperature settings of hot water at least 10° lower to
discourage lengthy shower- taking.
      (8)   Where plumbing fixtures can accommodate them, install flow-
restricting or other water- saving devices.
      (9)   Reduce the number of toilet flushes per day. Each flush uses about
five gallons. Reduce water used per flush by installing toilet tank
displacement inserts.
      (10)   Use sink and tub stoppers to avoid wasting water.
      (11)   Keep a bottle of chilled water in the refrigerator.
   (B)   Direct non-residential users to adopt the following conservation
measures.
      (1)   Identify and repair all leaky fixtures and water-using equipment.
Give special attention to equipment connected directly to water lines, such as
processing machines, steam-using machines, washing machines, water-cooled air
conditioners, and furnaces.
      (2)   Assure that valves and solenoids that control water flows are shut
off completely when the water-using cycle is not engaged.
      (3)   Adjust water-using equipment to use the minimum amount of water
required to achieve its stated purpose.

interruptions to all or part of its water supply system, as may be deemed
appropriate, when any and/or all of the following conditions are determined to
exist:
         (a)   The mandated reduction in system-wide usage has not been
achieved; and/or
         (b)   The mandated reduction in system-wide water usage has been
achieved, but has failed to have a significant impact in extending limited
water supplies; and/or
         (c)   Temporary service interruptions are necessary in order to
further extend limited and/or dwindling water supplies.
      (2)   (a)   In the event it is determined that temporary service
interruptions are necessary, the city shall notify its customers through the
public media (newspapers, radio, and television), at least one day prior to the
temporary service interruptions, that a planned, temporary service interruption
is to be imposed.
         (b)   Such notice shall:
            1.   State the day or days when the planned, temporary service
interruptions will occur;
            2.   State the time(s) when such planned, temporary service
interruptions will commence, and the time(s) such interruptions will cease;
            3.   State whether the planned, temporary service interruptions are
to be imposed on the entire system or part thereof, and, if only part(s) of the
system will experience planned, temporary service interruptions, identify
geographic boundaries within which such interruptions will occur; and
            4.   Advise all customers within the areas affected by planned,
temporary service interruptions how to treat any water received from the
system, for human consumption, during the period(s) of such interruptions and

delivery of water to health care facilities within the area(s) affected by such
interruptions, by means of any adequate, alternative delivery measures that may
be necessary.
      (4)   If a planned, temporary service interruption is implemented, it
must make provision, by any means possible, for the continued delivery of such
water as may be necessary for the proper operation of sewage collection,
treatment, and disposal systems and facilities.
   (C)   Any residential or non-residential water customer who exceeds the
allotments established pursuant to this water rationing will be subject to the
following excess-use charges:
      (1)   Excess-use charges will be collected based on the amount by which a
customer's use exceeds the water allotments established pursuant to the local
water rationing declaration, computed in accordance with the following
schedule:
 
Excess Usage Per Month        Charge For Excess
First 300 cu. ft. (min. bill) $14
Each additional 100 cu. ft.   $7
Note: 100 cu. ft. = 748 gallons
 
      (2)   Any monies collected through excess-use charges shall not be
accounted for as income, but shall be placed in a reserve account that is
dedicated to addressing water shortage problems and water conservation
initiatives.
   (D)   In addition to the excess use, a warning of possible discontinuation
shall be issued to the customer.
   (E)   For the second or subsequent excess use, service to the customer may
be interrupted or shut off for a period not to exceed 48 hours, or, if the
customer provides access, a flow restrictor may be installed in the customer's
service line for the duration of the emergency. The cost incurred to interrupt
or shut off and reinstate service, or to install and remove a flow restrictor,
shall be accessed to the water customer.
   (F)   Meter reading schedules are authorized to be altered to assure
adequate monitoring of compliance with this subchapter.
   (G)   Any customer or other person aggrieved by a decision or action
imposing an excess-use charge or other remedy for non-compliance with the
requirements of this subchapter may proceed in accordance with the following
provisions:
      (1)   The city shall adopt procedures which provide an opportunity for
the customer or aggrieved party to rebut the finding of a violation, or provide
evidence of circumstances beyond the customer's control which resulted in the
violation. A record of evidence regarding disputed violations shall be kept,
and a written notice of the city's final decision and action in such cases
shall be provided to the customer or aggrieved party.

within the city. The occupational license tax shall be measured by 2% of:
      (1)   All wages and compensation paid or payable in the city for work
done or services performed or rendered in the city by every resident and

occupational license tax if paid to an active employee.
   (B)   The occupational license tax imposed in this section shall not apply
to the following persons or business entities:
      (1)   Any bank, trust company, combined bank and trust company, or trust,

§ 110.04 APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) below, net profit shall be
apportioned as follows:
      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more
than one tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in division (B) below, plus
the sales factor, described in division (C) below, and the denominator of which
is two; and
      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax
district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in
division (C) below.
   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity
for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's
service is performed within the city.
   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity
everywhere during the tax period.
      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the
city if:
         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than
the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the
city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or
         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United
States government.
      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental
of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are
apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the
denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing
activity.
      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is
allocated to the tax district where the property is located.
   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
      (1)   Separate accounting;
      (2)   The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
      (3)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or
      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of net profit.
   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable
as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The
license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this subsection,
the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income
is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this chapter. The occupational
license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income before it is
"passed through" these entities to the owners.
   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from
the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner
surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution,
cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not
defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any
occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the
business entity had business activity in the city.
   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income
tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of
this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the
federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required
for federal income tax purposes.
(Ord. 07-40, passed 12-14-07)
§ 110.05 EMPLOYERS TO WITHHOLD.
   (A)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee shall
deduct and withhold from the compensation an occupational license tax
calculated under §
110.03.
   (B)    Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall, for the month of January, 2010 and for each month thereafter, on or

   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any sums
required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to be
withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who
fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be withheld under
this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld
to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were
required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien
shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the
city.
   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section
shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and file on a
form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the occupational
license tax withheld where compensation is paid or payable to employees. Either
copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage and tax statements, or
a detailed employee listing with the required equivalent information, as
determined by the city, shall be submitted.
   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or before
January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and occupational
license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid to the employee
for payment to the city during the preceding calendar year.
   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld under this section.
   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any other
person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity subject to
this section shall be personally and individually liable, both jointly and
severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation paid or
payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither the
corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city, nor
the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that liability;
provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to each and
every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax becomes or became
obligated. No person shall be personally and individually liable under this
division unless such person had authority to collect, truthfully account for,
or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the time that the taxes imposed
by this chapter become or became due.
   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H) above, every employee receiving
compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under §
110.03 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where the

(Ord. 22-08, passed 4-12-22)
§ 112.08 STANDARDS.
   The grantee shall conform to all standards or requirements in federal,
state, and local law or regulation in the operation of its Telecommunications
System pursuant to this chapter. In addition to complying with all applicable
law and regulations in state, federal, and local law, the grantee shall ensure:
   (A)   All working facilities and conditions used during construction,
installation and maintenance of facilities (including clearance of wires and
cables above the rights-of-way and placement of any underground facilities)
shall comply with the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, the National Electric Safety Code, and the National Electric
Code.
   (B)   All materials and equipment and apparatus used or installed in
construction shall be of first-class quality, and any defect in the work,
materials or equipment and apparatus, whether latent or patent, will be
remedied by the grantee at its cost;
   (C)   Construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or removal of any
facilities shall be performed with due regard for the rights of the city and
others, and shall not unnecessarily interfere with, or in any way injure the
property of the city or others under, on, or above the ground, or otherwise
unduly interfere with the public use of the rights-of-way;
   (D)   Placement of lights, danger signals or warning signs shall be
undertaken by the grantee in compliance with applicable law;
   (E)   Facilities shall be installed underground at any location where all
other utilities’ facilities that are used to provide customer service are then
being installed underground, or when otherwise required under the ordinances,
and shall be in conformance with the applicable requirements of this chapter
and those set forth in the code, the zoning ordinance, or any other applicable
local law or regulation. The grantee assumes all responsibility for damage or
injury resulting from its placement or maintenance of any above-ground
facilities;
   (F)   With respect to any facilities and equipment and apparatus of grantee
that are or have been installed aboveground in the rights-of-way, grantee may
be required subsequently, in order to protect public safety, to bury those
facilities which are capable of being placed underground at its expense subject
to the provisions of this chapter and/or city ordinances, rules and
regulations. Once grantee is permitted to install its facilities aboveground,
the city may require grantee to bury its facilities in conformance with city
ordinances, rules or regulations only on the condition that all utilities in
the rights-of-way are also required to bury their facilities. The grantee may
contract and agree with other affected utilities so that all costs for common
trenching, common utility vaults and other costs not specifically attributable
to the undergrounding of any particular facility are borne fairly and
proportionately by all utilities involved in the underground project.
   (G)   Grantee shall identify all its facilities, new and existing, by
tagging or marking its facilities with the grantee’s name and telephone number.
Additionally, grantee shall provide the city annually with an electronic map
(compatible with the city’s GIS system) which contains the location of all of
its facilities;
   (H)   The city, through its City Manager or his/her designee, or through
such assistants as the city may employ or designate, may, at all times and
under reasonable conditions with prior notice, have reasonable access to all or
any of the property or used in part or in whole by the grantee in its operating
and maintaining the telecommunications system under this chapter and located
within the rights-of-way;
   (I)   The grantee shall provide the city and/ or its Board of Commissioners
with information pertaining to its provision of telecommunications services
pursuant to this chapter upon reasonable request. This shall include, but is
not necessarily limited to, attending public meeting(s) at which some or all of
the Board of Commissioners members are in attendance (in order to provide such
information upon reasonable advance notice) and providing an annual update to
the Board of Commissioners upon its request;
   (J)   Facilities of the telecommunications system shall be concealed or
enclosed as much as possible in a box, cabinet, or other unit that may include
ventilation openings. External cables and wires hanging off poles, towers, or
support structure shall be sheathed or enclosed in a conduit, so that wires are
protected and not visible or visually minimized to the extent possible. All
such equipment and apparatus, boxes, cabinets and units shall be painted and
maintained to prevent any deterioration, degradation or rusting of such
equipment and apparatus, boxes, cabinets and units. Failure of grantee to
comply with this section, after a 30 day right-to-cure period, shall constitute
an event of default;
   (K)   As soon as practical, but not later than five days from the date
grantee receives notice thereof, grantee shall remove all graffiti on any of
its telecommunications system, facilities, poles, towers, or support structures
and related equipment and apparatus located in the rights-of-way. In the event
grantee does not remove the graffiti within the time period specified in this
section or should the city deem any graffiti to be overtly offensive or obscene
and reasonable discretion dictates its immediate removal, then the city may
remove or cause the graffiti to be removed promptly at the reasonable cost and
expense of grantee. Grantee shall reimburse the city within 30 days of billing
by the city accompanied by an itemized statement of the city’s reasonable
costs. Any removal of graffiti effected by painting over the graffiti shall be
done with the same color and type of paint as is on the telecommunications
system, facilities, poles, towers, or support structures or related equipment
and apparatus. The foregoing shall not relieve grantee from complying with any
city graffiti or visual blight ordinance or regulation.
   (L)   If at any time the city or other agency or authority of competent
jurisdiction determines that any work being done in the rights-of-way by
grantee or its contractors presents a danger to the public health, safety or
welfare, the city may require grantee to cease and desist all work until
grantee and/or its contractors, at its or their own expense, take the necessary
corrective action. Should the city have to correct any condition, the city
shall bill the grantee for the actual cost of such correction and the grantee
shall promptly reimburse the city for its actual costs. If the grantee fails to
promptly reimburse the city, the city may take whatever actions necessary to
enforce this chapter or grantee’s franchise awarded pursuant to this chapter,
including revoking grantee’s franchise.
   (M)   Grantee shall not allow or install power generators or back-up
generators in the rights-of-way without the express written consent of the
city.
   (N)   Grantee shall not erect or authorize or permit others on its behalf to
erect any pole, towers, support structures except when absolutely necessary to
provide telecommunication service. Poles, towers, support structures may not be
erected by the grantee when other poles, towers, support structures are
available on reasonable terms and conditions. Terms and condition which comply
with applicable state and/or federal regulations shall be deemed reasonable. No
poles, towers, or support structures shall be erected by the grantee without
prior approval of the city with regard to need, location, height, type, and any
other pertinent aspect. However, no location of and poles, towers, or support
structures of the grantee shall be a vested interest and such poles, towers, or
support structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own
expense whenever the city determines that the public health, welfare and/or
safety would be enhanced thereby.
   (O)   Where poles, towers, or support structures already existing for use in
serving the city are available for use by the grantee on reasonable terms and
conditions, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the government may
require the grantee to use such poles, towers, or support structures for
reasonable and proper consideration consistent with applicable law or place its
facilities underground if it determines that the public health, welfare and/or
safety would be enhanced thereby and if such use would not unduly interfere
with grantee’s operations.
   (P)   It is the policy of the city to encourage shared use of
telecommunications and other utility facilities by grantees whenever
practicable or feasible. Accordingly, grantee shall make available and grant
permission to other grantees of the rights-of-way the right to utilize
grantee’s poles, towers, support structures, conduit, conduit system, duct,
pipe or other facilities for the purpose of attaching or locating thereon or
therein any cable, wire, fiber optic lines, equipment and apparatus or other
facilities of such grantees; provided, however, that such utilization,
attachment or location is practicable or feasible and provided, the other
person enters grantee’s standard agreement, the terms and pricing provisions of
which shall be in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.
   (Q)   The city may require grantee to relocate its telecommunications
system, facilities, poles, towers, support structures and related equipment and
apparatus at the expense of grantee: (i) in order to allow the city to make any
public use of or improvements to the rights-of-way; (ii) as made necessary due
to a change in grade or other change in the rights-of-way made by the city;
(iii) as a result of traffic conditions or public safety or the widening or
reconfiguring streets, highways or lanes; (iv) as a result of the construction
or installation of any public structure or public improvement by the city, the
state or other public agency or district; or (v) in connection with any
decision or action by the city to abandon or vacate rights-of-way. Nothing in
this chapter or the franchise granted pursuant hereto shall abrogate the right
of the city, or any governmental authority, to perform or carry out any public
works or public improvements of any description, provided that the city shall
comply with the provisions of the Telecommunications Act. The city shall not be
liable for lost revenues sustained by grantee, however caused, because of
damage to, modification, alteration, or destruction of grantee’s facilities in
the rights-of-way or from the construction, installation, operation, and/ or
maintenance of city facilities, structures and/or the rights-of-way.
      (1)   The city shall provide 30 days’ prior written notice of the
necessary relocation. Grantee shall have at least 30 days to complete the
relocation.
      (2)   If grantee fails to complete the work within the time allotted by
the city, the city or other public agency or district may perform the work at
the expense of grantee.
      (3)   In the event grantee refuses or neglects to alter or relocate its
telecommunications system, facilities, poles, towers, support structures or
related equipment and apparatus in a timely fashion, the city or other public
agency shall have the right to break through, remove, alter or relocate such
facilities, equipment and apparatus, poles, towers, or support structures as
necessary without any damages or liability owing to grantee, and grantee shall
pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through,
removal, alteration or relocation. Grantee shall pay to the city, within 30
days of billing accompanied by an itemized statement, the actual costs incurred
by the city in connection with its relocation, removal and/or alteration of
grantee’s telecommunications system, facilities, poles, towers, support
structures and/or related equipment and apparatus.
      (4)   In cases of emergency, the city shall notify grantee promptly upon
learning of the emergency and the city may take necessary action to remediate
the emergency situation, exercising reasonable efforts to avoid an interruption
of grantee’s service. In cases of emergency, the city may cut, remove, or
relocate the grantee’s telecommunications system, facilities, poles, towers,
support structures, and related equipment and apparatus immediately at
grantee’s expense without notice to grantee, provided that the city shall
undertake efforts to notify grantee as soon as practicable after any
remediation is complete. Grantee shall bear all costs of reinstallation, repair
or other costs arising out of the emergency cutting, removal or relocation. All
costs incurred by the city in cutting, removing or relocating such facilities,
poles, towers, or support structures, and equipment and apparatus shall be paid
by grantee within 30 days of billing accompanied by an itemized statement by
the city.

any such provision, rule, order or determination. The grantee will be provided
the opportunity to appear and present evidence before the Mayor and the Board
of Commissioners, whose decision shall be the final administrative decision,
and shall be in writing and provide the basis for the decision. If the
violation by the grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such a
decision by the Mayor and the Board of Commissioners without written proof that
the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously
pursued by the grantee, the city may place its request for termination of the
franchise as early as the next regular Board of Commissioners meeting agenda.

resolution, declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated and
forfeited unless there is compliance by the grantee within such reasonable
period as the Board of Commissioners may fix. Any such determination by the
Board of Commissioners is a final appealable action to a court of competent
jurisdiction.

month). Thereafter, grantee shall pay each franchise fee (as applicable) in

well as in detail, of its calculation of the amount of the payment, verified by

city shall have the right to inspect the grantee’s income records, the right to
audit and to re-compute any amounts determined to be payable under any
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter; provided, however, that such audit

§ 112.22 AESTHETIC STANDARDS.
   Unless otherwise approved by the city in order to prevent an effective
prohibition of service in accordance with federal regulations, as applicable,
no person shall locate or maintain a facility, pole, tower, or support
structure, except in accordance with the following design standards:
   (A)   All facilities shall be located and designed so as to minimize visual
impact on surrounding properties and from rights-of-way.
   (B)   All new or replacement poles, towers, or support structures placed in
the rights-of-way shall be the same color, shape, material, and general height
as those existing poles, towers or support structures adjacent to the location
of the new or replacement pole, tower, or support structure.
   (C)   All coaxial, fiber-optic, or other cabling and wires shall be
contained inside any new or replacement tower, pole, or support structure. On
existing poles, towers, or support structures, or new wooden poles, where it is
impossible to place wiring inside the pole, tower or support structure, all
coaxial, fiber-optic, or other cabling and wires shall be flush-mounted and
covered with a metal, plastic, or similar material matching the color of the

same street of an existing tower. Replacing an existing tower with a tower, or
a lighted pole with another lighted pole housing wireless facilities, in the
same location shall not violate this provision.
   (E)   All new towers, support structures and poles should be located on the
same side of the street as existing towers, poles, or support structures.
However, this does not preclude an applicant from locating its wireless
facilities on existing lighted poles under a decommissioning agreement in which
the applicant takes ownership of the lighted pole.
   (F)   The centerline of any new pole, support structure or tower shall be
aligned with the centerline of adjacent poles or trees, unless the new

existing pole, support structure, or tower with another pole, support
structure, or tower in the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (G)   All new poles, towers, support structures or facilities proposed to be
fronting a dwelling shall be placed on property lines, unless it would obstruct
sight distance at driveways or other accesses to roadways. In those instances
where placement of a new pole, support structure, tower, or facilities on the
property line would obstruct sight distance, the pole, support structure or
tower, or facilities shall be placed in such a location as to prevent the
obstruction of sight distance at driveways or other accesses to roadways.
Replacing an existing pole, support structure, tower or facility with a pole,
support structure, tower, or facility in the same location shall not violate
this provision.
   (H)   New poles, support structures, towers, or facilities shall not be
placed in front of store front windows, walkways, entrances or exits, or in
such a way that would impede deliveries. Replacing an existing pole, support
structure, tower, or facility with a pole, support structure, tower, or
facility in the same location shall not violate this provision.
   (I)   No new poles, support structures or towers shall be placed in front of

structure, or tower with a pole, support structure, or tower in the same
location shall not violate this provision.
   (J)   No applicant shall locate or maintain a pole, support structure,
tower, or equipment associated with a wireless facility, as to interfere with
the health of a tree.
   (K)   In areas where the undergrounding of utilities has occurred, but
lighted poles are present, the applicant shall locate its wireless facilities
on existing lighted poles or seek to decommission the lighted pole to replace
it with a lighted pole to house its wireless facilities.
   (L)   If the applicant elects to decommission an existing lighted pole in
order to install a wireless facility in its location, the applicant shall
comply with this chapter including these aesthetic standards, and any
decommissioning agreement between the applicant and the city or its equivalent.
   (M)   In those locations where the undergrounding of utilities has occurred,
all facilities shall be placed underground.
   (N)   No equipment associated with any facility shall impede, obstruct, or
hinder ADA access, or pedestrian or vehicular access, or block driveways,
entrances, or walkways. The installation of new ground furniture is prohibited.
   (O)   To protect the health and safety of the public from the harms of noise
pollution, all facilities shall have a low noise profile.
   (P)   Within 21 calendar days from the date the operator receives notice
thereof, operator shall remove all graffiti on any of its facilities located in
the rights-of-way.
   (Q)   All facilities, poles, towers, and support structures shall comply
with such additional design standards as may be set forth in any written
policies or guidelines issued by the city.
   (R)   All poles, towers, support structures, and other lines and equipment
installed or erected by grantee under this chapter shall be located so as to
minimize any interference with the proper use of the rights-of-way with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners whose property adjoins or
abuts any affected rights-of-way. Subject to applicable codes, overhead drops
shall be as close as possible to other utility drops in order to concentrate
the drops in as small an area as possible to minimize visual clutter and
interference with the use of private property.

traffic control plans to be implemented during the construction work and
specific traffic control devices to be utilized. Additionally, grantee shall
notify the city of the hours the construction will take place at least seven
days prior to beginning construction. Nothing in the above provisions is
intended to require grantee to give a notification for any routine maintenance
or repair work not involving the cutting of the rights-of-way, curb, or gutter
or not involving an interruption of traffic flow on a city street. Nothing in
the above is intended to impose on grantee any obligation to give notification
or obtain a city permit for work on customers’ service lines, unless such work

within two years of the excavation where grantee knew or should have known that
it would need to excavate the pavement within two years of the city notifying
grantee of the streets that will be repaved. The above provisions shall not

changes, or improves any rights-of-way as part of any public improvement
project and such work requested by the city shall be accomplished by grantee

requested of grantee cannot be reasonably completed within that time period,
grantee shall have such additional time to complete its work as may be mutually
agreed upon between grantee and the city.

contravention of state or federal law. The grant of a franchise does not in any
way affect the continuing authority of the city through the proper exercise of
its home rule or statutory powers to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to
provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public. The city makes no
express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize
the installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of the
rights-of-way. The burden and responsibility for making all such determinations
in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely upon the
franchisee. The use of the rights-of-way authorized by any franchise shall in
all matters be subordinate to the city's use and rights therein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing:

powers of the city and its rights under applicable laws and regulations to

its police powers, the right to adopt and enforce applicable zoning, building,

other present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers shall be
resolved in favor of the latter.
      (3)   Franchisee shall not be excused from complying with any of the
requirements of this chapter or any subsequently adopted amendments to this
chapter, by any failure of the city on any one or more occasions to seek, or

and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership, and
operations of the franchisee with respect to the system in a manner that allows
the city to determine whether the franchisee has properly calculated its
communications franchise fee in compliance with this chapter. Should the city
reasonably determine that the records are not being maintained in such manner,
the franchisee shall correct the manner in which the books and/or records are
maintained so that the franchisee comes into compliance with this section. All
financial books and records which are maintained in accordance with FCC
regulations, the regulations of the Kentucky Public Service Commission and any
other governmental entity that regulates utilities in the state, and generally
accepted accounting principles shall be deemed to be acceptable underthis
section. Such books and records shall be maintained for a period of at least
three years. The failure to provide information or maintain records as required
herein shall be grounds for forfeiture or revocation of a franchise.
   (N)   Right of inspection and audit. The city or its designated
representatives shall have the right to inspect, examine or audit, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, all documents, records or
other information that pertain to the system and/or a franchisee's
communications franchise fee obligations under its franchise. In addition to
access to the records of the franchisee for audits, upon request, a franchisee

the terms of the franchise. A franchisee shall pay all reasonable audit costs
incurred by the city to a maximum of one audit per year.

required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges,
assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or
may be imposed by the city. A franchisee shall be fully responsible for the
payment of all applicable taxes.

franchisee and such reseller service providers and/or lessees, and describe the
compensation to be provided to franchisee relating to such reseller service
providers and/or lessees.
   (R)   Sale or lease of facilities. Except as otherwise may be provided by
law or franchise, a franchisee shall not sell, or otherwise transfer possession
or control of any facilities, or any portion thereof, for any purpose to any
person that has not obtained a duly issued franchise which includes the
authority to erect, install, maintain, operate, repair, replace, remove or
restore such facilities. Franchisee shall provide the city at least 30 days
prior notice of any intended sale, lease or transfer of possession or control.
   (S)   Assignment of franchise.
      (1)   A franchise does not run with the land. A franchisee shall not
sell, assign, sublet, dispose of or otherwise transfer a franchise (or any of
the rights or privileges granted by such franchise) to another person,
including, without limitation, by operation of law, without the prior written
consent of the city; provided that such transfer may occur without the consent
of the city to an affiliate upon 30 days prior notice to the city; and
provided, further, that entry into an agreement with a reseller service
provider related to the resale of the franchisee's communications services or
entry into an agreement with a lessee related to the lease of the facilities
shall not, by itself, be deemed such a transfer. The city's consent to such a
transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
      (2)   In seeking the city's consent to a transfer, the franchisee and its
proposed transferee shall provide to the city in writing:
         (a)   Such information with respect to the proposed transferee as is
currently required of applicants for a renewal of a franchise; and
         (b)   An agreement, in form and substance acceptable to the city, that
the transferee will assume and be bound by all of the provisions, terms, and
conditions of this chapter and the franchise and shall be primarily liable and
obligated under such documents without, however, relieving the transferring
franchisee from its obligations to the city under such documents, including
without limitation its obligations under division (V) of this section.
      (3)   Franchisee shall be liable to the city for any and all costs
incurred by the city, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and
other consultants' fees, resulting from any such attempt to transfer the
franchise.
      (4)   Nothing in any approval by the city of any transfer pursuant to
this section shall be construed to waive, release or delegate any rights or
powers of the city.
   (T)   Forfeiture of franchise and privilege. In case of failure on the part
of a franchisee, its successors and assigns, to comply with any of the
provisions of this chapter or its franchise, or if the franchisee, its
successors and assigns, should do or cause to be done any act or thing
prohibited by or in violation of this chapter or the terms of its franchise,
the franchisee, its successors and assigns, shall forfeit all rights and
privileges permitted by this chapter and its franchise, and all rights
hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, provided that said
forfeiture shall not take effect until the city shall carry out the following
proceedings: Before the city declares the forfeiture or revocation of a
franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon the franchisee, setting
forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and the company shall
have 30 days thereafter, or such other reasonable period established by the
City Commission, in which to cure the default by complying with the conditions
of its franchise and fully remedying any default or violation. If at the end of
such 30 day or other reasonable period, the city determines that the conditions
have not been complied with, the city shall take action by an affirmative vote
of a majority of the City Commission present at the meeting and voting, to
terminate the franchise, setting out the grounds upon which the franchise is to
be forfeited or revoked. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from invoking
any other remedy available at law or in equity.
   (U)   Special rules for governmental entities. Nothing herein requires the
city to apply the provisions of this chapter to a governmental entity if the
city determines that it is not in the public interest to do so, and nothing in
this chapter shall be read to require a governmental entity to comply with this
chapter where the city cannot enforce the ordinance against such entity as a
matter of law. The city is authorized to enter into agreements with other
governmental agencies to facilitate the city's use and management of the
rights-of-way, and such agreements shall be enforceable according to their
respective terms and notwithstanding any provision of this chapter.
   (V)   Public benefit services. During the entire ten year term of this
franchise, the grantee shall provide the city with DS 3 capibility (at 45 megs
per second) over its entire system located within Madison County, Kentucky. The
grantee shall cooperate with the city in accessing and connecting with said
fiber.
   (W)   Local On-Net. Grantee shall make available to grantor, for grantor's
own internal use, one Local On-Net DS3. A Local On-Net DS3 refers to a DS3:
      (1)   That is transported wholly over existing fiber owned by grantee;
and
      (2)   That both originates and terminates within the city limits. The two
specific endpoints between which the DS3 is to span will be as mutually agreed
to between grantor and grantee. If no endpoints are set forth in the franchise
agreement, then grantor shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this
section, as it relates to that grantee.
      (3)   Other terms applicable to the Local On-Net DS3 are as follows:
         (a)   Grantee shall not, under any circumstance, be required to
construct new network to support the Local On-Net DS3 to be provided grantor
under this section; however
         (b)   It is contemplated that grantee might undertake some activities
to interconnect its network with the mutually agreed to endpoints. In that
instance:
            1.   Grantor hereby grants to grantee, a license to interconnect
to, and collocate equipment in, each of the mutually agreed to endpoints (the
"license"). The license includes all necessary power, rights of way and
building entrance rights. No fees or charges shall be imposed on grantee in
connection with, or related to, the license; and
            2.   Grantor shall pay grantee within 30 days of receipt of
grantee's invoice therefore, all costs incurred by grantee for or related to
those activities. At grantee's discretion, it may, prior to performing such
activities, require a deposit in an amount equal to grantee's reasonable
estimate of the costs it will incur for or related to those activities.

which is incorporated herein by reference and such provisions and the
provisions of said encroachment permit shall be deemed a condition of any
franchise.
   (B)   Additional facilities requirements; planned infrastructure.  When a
franchisee installs any new underground facilities, the franchisee shall,
unless waived by the city, simultaneously install conduit provided by the city

   (C)   Removal of facilities. Upon expiration of a franchise, whether by
lapse of time, by agreement between the franchisee and the city, or by
forfeiture thereof, the franchisee shall remove, at its sole cost, from the
rights-of-way any and all of its facilities that are the subject of such
franchise within a reasonable time after such expiration, not to exceed 90
days, and, it shall be the duty of the franchisee immediately upon such removal
to restore the rights-of-way from which the facilities are removed to as good
condition as the same were before the removal was effected and as required by
the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may allow facilities to be
left in place when the city determines in its sole discretion that it is not
practical or desirable to require removal.
   (D)   Relocation of facilities. Whenever the city shall in its exercise of
the public interest request of the franchisee the relocation or reinstallation
of any of its facilities, the franchisee shall forthwith remove, relocate, or
reinstall any such property as may be reasonably necessary to meet the request
and the cost of such relocation, removal, or reinstallation of the facilities
shall be the exclusive obligation of such franchisee. A franchisee shall, upon
request of any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a
validly issued building or moving permit of the city, temporarily raise, lower,
or relocate its wires or other facilities as may be required for the person to
exercise the rights under the permit within 48 hours prior to the date upon
which said person intends to exercise its rights under said permit; provided,
however, that the franchisee may require such permit holder to make payment in
advance for any expenses incurred by said franchisee pursuant to such person's
request.
   (E)   Franchisee responsible for costs. A franchisee shall be responsible
for all reasonable costs incurred by the city that are directly associated with

relocating its facilities when required by the city due to city requirements
relating to maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for city purposes.
   (F)   Insurance and bonds. During the term of any franchise, a franchisee
shall obtain and maintain at its sole expense, all insurance and bonds required

herewith shall file with their applications performance bonds with a surety
company or trust company or companies as surety or sureties solely for the
protection of the city in an amount determined by the City Commission to be
reasonable for the proposed scope of the system to be effective. The
determination of the amount of the performance bond required shall be made in a
nondiscriminatory manner. Said performance bond shall provide for the faithful
performance of any and all provisions of this chapter and franchisee's
franchise, including but not limited to construction and installation,
maintenance, relocation, communications franchise fee payment, and/or removal
of any abandoned facilities. Upon demonstration of the completion of the
construction of the system by franchisee to the city, the city shall reduce the
amount of the performance bond by 75%.
      (2)   Said performance bond shall indemnify the city in its own right and
as trustee, from any damages or losses arising out of the failure of franchisee
to faithfully perform and satisfactorily complete construction of the system in
accordance with this chapter and any agreement and ordinance in connection
herewith, including, but not limited to, the cost of removal of any
construction.
      (3)   The failure of franchisee to comply with its obligations under this
chapter or the franchise as determined by the city shall entitle the city to
draw against said performance bond.
      (4)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the performance
bonds required hereunder are in addition to all other rights of the city,
whether reserved by this chapter or authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such performance bond shall
affect any other rights the city may have.
      (5)   The performance bonds required hereunder shall not expire or be
materially altered without 30 days written notice and without securing and
delivering to the city a substitute, renewal and replacement bond in
conformance with this chapter. In the event the city does draw monies against
the performance bonds required hereunder, within ten days thereafter,
franchisee shall pay such funds to the bonding company as necessary to bring
said performance bonds back to the applicable principal, where it shall
continue to be maintained. The performance bonds required hereunder shall
contain the following endorsements:
      "It is hereby understood and agreed that this performance bond may not be
reduced, altered or canceled by franchisee or the bonding company without 30
days written notice, by certified mail, to the City Clerk."

coverage required under this chapter, which certificate shall be subject to the
approval of the city as to the adequacy of the certificate and of the insurance
certified under the requirements of this chapter. Such policy(s) and
certificate shall be identified on their face by the name of franchisee, and
shall be submitted to the City Clerk, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this chapter. Failure to maintain adequate insurance as required
under this chapter shall be deemed a breach of the franchise.
      (8)   Franchisee shall maintain public liability, property damage and
other insurance required by this chapter that protects franchisee and the city,
its officers, agents, employees and appointed and elected officials from any
and all claims for damages or personal injury including death, demands,
actions, and suits brought against any of them arising from operations under
the franchise or in connection therewith. This insurance coverage constitutes a
minimum requirement and shall in no way be deemed to lessen, limit or define
the liability of franchisee, related entities, its successors or assigns, under
the terms of the franchise.
      (9)   The City Commission reserves the right to make increases in the
amount of insurance coverage referred to in this section at any time.
   (G)   Permits. Prior to performing any construction or installation work in

completed by the city at franchisee's expense.
      (3)   At any time franchisee disturbs the yard, residence, or other real
or personal property in the city, franchisee shall ensure that the yard,
residence, or other personal property is returned, replaced, and/or restored to
a condition that is sufficiently comparable to the condition that existed prior
to the commencement of the work.

replacement, and/or restoration shall be borne by franchisee.
   (J)   Aerial construction. Aerial construction of facilities must be

minimize interference with the other uses of the rights-of-way and other public
properties, and interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners whose property adjoins any of the rights-of-way and other
public properties. The decision to authorize above ground construction shall be
applied in a non-discriminatory manner. If other franchisees have facilities
above ground and there is capacity available, above ground installations shall
be permitted until such time as all franchisees are required to relocate
underground. Aerial facilities shall be moved underground at franchisee's own
cost upon request from the city or when other users of the same rights-of-way
convert to underground facilities.
   (K)   Standards. Any work required or performed pursuant to this chapter

conduits of an electric or other utility, franchisee shall abide by the

or indirectly employed by franchisee, shall conduct such operations so as to
promote and preserve the public safety and general welfare of the citizens of

be completed with diligence and with respect to all property, contracts,

requirements of this chapter if a franchisee, upon application, demonstrates
with written evidence that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare;
      (2)   Franchisee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on franchisee's construction schedule resulting from
the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively prohibits the
ability of franchisee to provide communications services in the city; and
      (3)   Franchisee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against franchisee in favor of another person.
      (4)   Any special exceptions shall be granted in a non-discriminatory
manner.

franchisee's system in the rights-of-way are subject to inspection by the city.

and before resurfacing of the rights-of-way, natural wear of the surface
excepted, franchisee shall, upon written notice from the city, immediately
proceed to inspect the depressed or broken area over the excavation to
ascertain the cause of the failure. Franchisee shall make repairs to the
installation or backfill and have the pavement restored as specified by the
city, within such time period as may be specified by the city. If the pavement
is not restored as specified by the city within the time period specified by

requirements of a franchise, or because of the enforcement thereof by the city,
or for the failure of the city to have the authority to grant, all, or any
part, of the rights therein granted; provided, however, that each franchisee
acknowledges by its acceptance of the franchise that it has accepted the rights
therein granted in reliance upon its independent and personal investigation and

131.99   Penalty
§ 131.01 DISTRIBUTION OF SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL TO MINORS; DISPLAY OF SAME.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate the direct
commercial distribution of certain explicit sexual materials to minors in order
to aid parents and guardians in supervising and controlling the access of
minors to such material. The Commission finds that whatever social value such
material may have for minors can adequately be served by its availability to
young persons through their parents or guardians. It is also the purpose of
this section to prohibit open public display of certain explicit sexual
materials, in order to protect persons from potential offense through
involuntary exposure to such materials.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DISPLAY FOR SALE IN AN AREA TO WHICH MINORS HAVE ACCESS. Display where
minors are able to see it.
      DISSEMINATE. To sell, lease or exhibit commercially and, in the case of
an exhibition, to sell an admission ticket or pass, or to admit persons who
have bought such a ticket or pass to the premises whereon an exhibition is
presented.
      EXPLICIT SEXUAL MATERIAL. Any pictorial or three-dimensional material,
motion picture, still picture, photograph, book, pocketbook, pamphlet or
magazine, the cover or contents of which depict human sexual intercourse,
masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral or anal intercourse; direct physical
stimulation of unclothed genitals; flagellation or torture in the context of a
sexual relationship; or which emphasizes the depiction of adult human genitals,
buttocks or the female breast; provided, however, that works of art or of
anthropological significance or materials when presented in a program of
education in a church, school or college shall not be deemed to be within the
foregoing definitions.
      KNOWINGLY. Having general knowledge of, or reason to know, or a belief or
ground for belief, which warrants further inspection or inquiry of both of the
following:
         (1)   The character and contents of any material described herein
which is reasonably susceptible of examination; and
         (2)   The age of the person; provided, however, that an honest mistake
shall constitute an excuse from liability hereunder if a reasonable bona fide
attempt is made to ascertain the true age of the person.
      MATERIAL PLACES UPON “PUBLIC DISPLAY.” Material placed on or in a
billboard, viewing screen, theater marquee, newsstand, display rack, window,
showcase, display case or similar place so that matter bringing it within the
definition of “explicit sexual material” is easily visible from a public
thoroughfare or from the property of others.
      MINOR. A person less than 18 years of age.
   (C)   Offenses defined. A person is guilty of a violation of this section if
he or she:
      (1)   Knowingly disseminates explicit sexual material to a minor; or
      (2)   Knowingly displays “explicit sexual material” for sale in an area
to which minors have access, unless such material has artistic, literary,
historical, scientific, medical, educational or other similar social value for
adults and access to such material is limited to adults; or
      (3)   Knowingly places explicit sexual material upon public display, or
if he knowingly fails to take prompt action to remove such a display from
property in his possession after learning of its existence.
   (D)   Defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to a prosecution under
this section for the defendants to show:
      (1)   That the dissemination was made with the consent of a parent or
guardian of the recipient or that the defendant was misled as to the existence
of parental consent by a misrepresentation made by a person holding himself out
as a parent or guardian of the recipient, or that the dissemination was made to
the recipient by his teacher, or clergyman in the discharge of official
responsibilities;
      (2)   That the recipient was married.
   (E)   Exemption for broadcast. The prohibition of this section shall not
apply to broadcasts of telecasts through facilities licensed under the Federal
Communications Act, 47 USC 201 et seq.
('79 Code, § 14-70) (Ord. 78-35, passed 10-17-78) Penalty, see §
131.99

condition;
      (2)   Conductors or apparatus have been installed without a permit; or
      (3)   Conductors or apparatus have been installed contrary to the
provisions of the National Electrical Code or this subchapter. He shall
thereupon attach a notice stating that such conductors or apparatus are in
violation of the National Electrical Code and until the same have been placed
in a safe condition they will not be approved by the Electrical Inspector, nor
will electrical service be restored. Unauthorized removal of this notice shall
be punishable according to this chapter. The notice will be removed by the
Electrical Inspector only upon issuing of a final certificate of approval.
   (H)   The Electrical Inspector shall issue a certificate of final inspection
when an electrical installation is completed and found by him to comply with

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in Kentucky Revised
Statutes delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the city hereby adopts the following floodplain
management ordinance as follows.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 12-12-17)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location
in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 12-12-17)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by
provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood height or velocity;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (E)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage, and;
   (F)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
areas.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 12-12-17)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such
a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; and,
   (G)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a
Special Flood Hazard Area.
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 12-12-17)
§ 152.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.
   ABATEMENT. When there is reason to believe that the violation poses a
serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare; or in situations where
damage resulting from continuation of the violation would be irreparable or
irreversible; or if the violation represents a continuing public nuisance, the
government may, without further notice, proceed to abate the conditions. In the
case of a continuing public nuisance, abatement involving the removal of
structures or materials shall only take place after a civil citation has been
issued and has not been appealed to the Ordinance Enforcement Board, or after
an appealed civil citation has been upheld by the Ordinance Enforcement Board.
The government may, in addition to any fine imposed herein, charge the
responsible person, persons or entities with the cost of abatement, including
equipment expense; disposal fee, if any; and an administrative fee of $1,000.
The city may file a lien for such abatement, in accordance with this chapter
and KRS 65.8835. Citations, if issued, shall not preclude the government from
abating the conditions and billing the responsible person, persons or entities
for the cost of abatement.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental
to the use of the principle structure. Accessory structures should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory
structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   AL-30 AND AE ZONES. Special Flood Hazard Areas inundated by the 1% annual
chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.
   AH ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one
and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown.
   AO ZONE. An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between
one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) Flood depths are
shown.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the floodplain
administrator's ruling on a request for a variance.
   AR/A1 - A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AND AR/A ZONES. Special Flood Hazard Areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-
year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these
areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
   A99 ZONE. That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction. No base flood elevations are determined.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three
feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   B AND X ZONES (SHADED). Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood,
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile, and areas protected
by levees from the base flood.
   BASE FLOOD. A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE) - The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, ARIA, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and AR/
AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a
1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground;
including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made
facility or infrastructure. See STRUCTURE.
   C AND X (UNSHADED) ZONES. Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the Regular
Program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop
extra measures for protection from flooding.
   COMMUNIS FLOOD HAZARD AREA (CFHA). An area that has been determined by the
Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified
community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.
   CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT. That which is critical to the community's public
health and safety; is essential to the orderly functioning of a community;
store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials; or house
occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury.

facilities, public and private utilities, fire stations, emergency operation
centers, police facilities, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities,
water plants, gas/oil/propane storage facilities, hazardous waste handling and
storage facilities and other public equipment storage facilities.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe
consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or
unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the
health and safety of the public. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not
limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to
avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and
equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called
upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities
important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after
a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store
volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

elevated above ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls,
piling, columns (post and piers), shear walls, or breakaway walls. (See
freeboard requirements for residential and non-residential structures.)
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A statement certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor on the FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification that verifies a structure's elevation and other related
information to verify compliance with this chapter.

used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the
structure.
   ENCROACHMENT. The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth,
fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a
floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the "start of construction"
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for
FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to
as "Existing structures".
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date

      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e. mudflows). See MUDSLIDES.
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See FLOOD-
RELATED EROSION.

Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). A map on which the boundaries of the
flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special
hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). A map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has
delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing
flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), and/or the Flood Boundary
Floodway Map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by flood waters from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed by a NFIP participating
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and
open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of
police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant
utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all
structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also

regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional
hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not
just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to
the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as
building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §
152.60, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city will
consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to government
responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred
years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result
from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or
misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of
a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its
appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing
capacity).
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a

provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with State or
community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss
by flood.
      (1)   When a building covered by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under
the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares the building to be
substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the
cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building.
      (2)   ICC COVERAGE is available on residential and non-residential
buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as
schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.

county, or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts,
drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies,
shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of
any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except
those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or
in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such
work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for
the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and
specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit
issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments
or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to require approval
by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
      (2)   No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the state
shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other
material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building,
barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or
stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising or
obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the
floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been
submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in
division (1) above.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any
jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement,
enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch, or
system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the
same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by
the cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water
resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control
thereof so notified. The Kentucky Bureau of Surface Mining through KRS Chapter
350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the
regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other
obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which
structures are permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining
operations.

collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD). (see BASE FLOOD.) The flood that
has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any
flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the 100-year flood. Over

sediments, dissolved materials, and other transportable materials drain or are
carried by water to a common outlet, such as a point on a larger stream, lake,
or underlying aquifer.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% probability of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood) in any year. Unshaded X zones (C zones on older
FIRMS) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is
less than 0.2%.

§ 152.06 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), and, as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator or other delegated, designated, or
qualified community official as determined by the city from available technical
studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources,
areas within the jurisdiction of the city which may be subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the citizens of the city.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 12-12-17)
§ 152.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   (A)   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Madison County
dated December 21, 2017 with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMS), other supporting data and any subsequent amendments thereto, are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations by
the city and for those land areas acquired by the city through annexation. This
FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter
and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation
of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain
Administrator and are enacted by City Council pursuant to statutes governing
land use management regulations. The FIS and/or FIRM are permanent records of
the city and are on file and available for review by the public during regular
business hours at the City of Richmond Planning and Zoning Office at 239 West
Main Street, Richmond Kentucky.

designee to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter
by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions,
and is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 12-12-17)
§ 152.26 ESTABLISHMENT OF LAND DISTURBANCE PERMIT.
   A development/land disturbance permit shall be obtained before any
construction or other development begins within any special flood hazard area
established in §
152.07. Application for a development/land disturbance permit shall be made on
forms furnished by Floodplain Administrator, or their designee prior to any
development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following:
plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing.
Endorsement of local administrator is required before a state floodplain
construction permit can be processed. Specifically, the following information
is required.
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level (MSL) of the
proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and
elevation of highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level to which any non-
residential structure will be flood-proofed;
      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will
meet the flood-proofing criteria in §
152.41(B) and §
152.43(B);
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Construction stage.
      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
State a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built, in relation to Mean Sea Level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A
zones where the Community has adopted a regulatory Base Flood Elevation, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken
prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood
proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 152.40 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In all Special Flood Hazard Areas the following provisions are required:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
   (B)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or fame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition equipment,
and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding; and if
   (F)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (G)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
   (H)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;
   (I)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and,
   (J)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter;
   (K)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered, extended, or
replaced.
   (L)   Prohibited uses.
      (1)   Storage or processing of materials that are hazardous, flammable,
or explosive in the identified special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Storage of material or equipment that, in time of flooding, could
become buoyant and pose an obstruction to flow in identified floodway areas.
      (3)   Storage of material or equipment not otherwise prohibited shall be
firmly anchored to prevent flotation.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 12-12-17)
§ 152.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been
provided, as set forth in §
152.07, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower
than three feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation
perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with standards of division (C) of this section.
      (1)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified.
      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, structures and mechanicals shall be
elevated three feet above the base flood elevation, as determined by this
community. The Floodplain Administrator will determine the method by which base
flood elevations are determined. Methods include but are not limited to
detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from
other sources, use of historical data, best supportable and reasonable
judgement in the event no data can be produced. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky
Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as
a part of the technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The
applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries(and
thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA
maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea
level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than plus five-tenths
foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent
significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of
the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire
base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by
the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not
occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site
elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory
floodway boundary calculations.
      (3)   In any area that has been removed from the floodplain via a Letter
of Map Revision Based on Fill, any existing or new structure, addition, or
substantial improvement must meet the required elevation freeboard requirements
of the underlying flood hazard elevation.
      (4)   In all other zones, elevated three feet above the base flood
elevation.
         (a)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the
lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection
department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
         (b)   Freeboard requirements add height above the base flood elevation
to account for future flood fringe development, uncertainties inherent with the
methodologies, lack of data, debris that accompanies the base flood, and flood
levels higher than that of the base flood. A freeboard requirement means that
new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures will be
protected to a level higher than the base flood elevation.
         (c)   Freeboard may be applied not just to the elevation of the lowest
floor or floodproofing level, but also to the level of protection provided to
all components of the structure. All structure utilities, including ductwork,
must be elevated or protected to the freeboard level and all portions of the
structure below the freeboard level must be constructed using materials
resistant to flood damage. If the lowest floor of garages or accessory
structures is below the freeboard level, the structure must meet the opening
requirements of division (C) of this section.
         (d)   Two references on these requirements are Protecting Building
Utilities from Flood Damage, FEMA-348, and Flood Resistant Materials
Requirements, FIA-TB-2.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation three feet above the level of
the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, three feet above the
level of the base flood elevation, or;
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
152.26(A)(3).
      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in §
152.41(D).
      (6)   In any area that has been removed from the floodplain via a Letter
of Map Revision Based on Fill, any existing or new structure, addition, or
substantial improvement must meet the required elevation freeboard requirements
of the underlying flood hazard elevation.
      (7)   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an
elevation three feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-
93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
and
         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base
flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade); and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on
sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
         (a)   On individual lots or parcels;
         (b)   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (c)   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
         (d)   In substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;
         (e)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; and
         (f)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result
of a flood.
      (2)   All manufactured homes must be:
         (a)   Elevated on a permanent foundation;
         (b)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than three feet above
the level of the base flood elevation; and
         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (3)   Excepting manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage
as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that
the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than three (3) feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
      (4)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-30,
AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must either:
         (a)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         (c)   Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this

disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
152.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with
supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
      (2)   If §
152.41(E) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and
other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of 152.40 et seq.
   (F)   Standards for utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
         (a)   Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
         (b)   Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
      (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them, or contamination from them during flooding.
   (G)   Structures elevated on fill. A residential or non-residential
structure may be constructed on permanent fill in accordance with the

no greater than a 2:1 ratio unless a stability analysis is provided by a
registered professional engineer;
      (3)   The top of the fill shall be no lower than three feet above the
base flood elevation. However, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a
structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the structure
from damage due to erosion, scour, and other hydrodynamic forces;
      (4)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties;
      (5)   All new structures built on fill must be constructed on properly
designed and compacted fill (ASTM D-698 or equivalent) that extends beyond the
building walls before dropping below the base flood elevation and has
appropriate protection from erosion and scour. The design of the fill or the
fill standard must be approved by a licensed professional engineer;
      (6)   The city has adopted and enforces the soil testing and compaction

152.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the

including basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest
adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no
flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone
AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as stated in §
152.41(B).

(Ord. 17-31, passed 12-12-17)
APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 152.60 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Nature Of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The city has established a
Board of Adjustments which shall hear all variances and appeals. See City of
Richmond Development Ordinance section 404.
   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustments shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustments or
any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the circuit court as provided in
Kentucky Revised Statutes. See also section 405.8 of the City of Richmond
Development ordinance.
   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Board of Adjustments shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by the
proposed facility;
      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case
of functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Adjustments may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected below the BFE.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the city need not grant permission for the
applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant
proposes, but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide
relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be
made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not
destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of
the public (as defined in § 152.05) or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the
difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the
structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
      (7)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
      (8)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of division (C)(1) -
(5) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by
methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result
in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the Madison County Clerk and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway variances shall not be
issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.

§ 152.99 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION NOTICE AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Civil offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil offense.
   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized employee or
agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
person has caused development to occur which is not in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying with the terms and
conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any approved modifications
thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain Administrator shall issue
a notice to the person responsible for the violation and/or the property owner,
stating the facts of the offense or violation, the section of this chapter and/
or of the permit violated, when it occurred, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with the
approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur, which
period of time shall be reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the
violation and whether or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may
include an order to stop work on the development. The notice shall also state
that a citation may be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and
corrective actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary
fine and shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.
   (C)   Notice of citation. Notice of Violation: If, at any time, a duly
authorized employee or agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable
cause to believe that a person has caused development to occur which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or complying
with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit and any
approved modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the Floodplain
Administrator may issue a citation to the offender stating the violation, prior
notices of violation issued, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the
development into conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and
within what period of time the remedy is to occur, and what penalty or
penalties are recommended. When a citation is issued, the person to whom the
citation is issued shall respond to the citation within seven days of the date
the citation is issued by either carrying out the remedies and corrections set
forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or
requesting a hearing before the governing body. If the person to whom the
citation is issued does not respond to the citation within seven days, that
person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the
determination that a violation occurred shall be considered final.
   (D)   Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special
exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined no less than $5,000 or imprisoned for not
more than 30 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses
involved in the case, including the cost of abatement and fees Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

restoration, rehabilitation, adaptive reuse, or other alternatives to
demolition; and
      (2)   Study the question of economic hardship for the applicant including
whether the landmark or the property can be put to reasonable beneficial use
without the approval of the demolition; and whether the applicant can obtain a
reasonable return from the existing building. If economic hardship or the lack
of a reasonable return is not proved, the Board of Architectural Review shall
deny the demolition application, giving the facts and reasons for its decision.

outlined, a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be given to the applicant and

building permit, it shall transmit its decision to the Building Inspector. In

date of the decision of the Commission. After one year from the date of the
decision of the Commission, the Building Inspector shall issue the building
permit provided that the application meets all other requirements of law.
      (3)   In rebuilding, a structure shall not be permitted to be set any
closer to the front lot line as the original structure.

the Board or the Planning Commission staff shall present to the Board at the
public hearing the reasons for the notice, and the property owner shall have
the right to present any rebuttal thereto.

through the Building Inspector or other appropriate officer of such department,
bring charges against the applicant for the violation of this chapter. The city
also may cause such property to be repaired at its expense at such time as
funds are appropriated, and the city may file an affidavit to this effect in
the office of the city Tax Assessor, which shall constitute a lien and
privilege against the property.

§ 156.03 VACANT PROPERTY REVIEW COMMISSION.
   (A)   There is hereby established and created a Vacant Property Review
Commission (the Commission) for the City of Richmond. The Commission shall be
composed of five members who shall be appointed by the Mayor with the approval
of the Board of Commissioners. Members of the Commission shall be residents of
the city and shall serve for terms of five years and until their successors are
duly appointed and qualified, except that the members first appointed shall be
so appointed that the term of one member shall expire annually thereafter.
Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as regular appointments and for
the unexpired term of the vacancy. Members shall serve without pay. No officer
or employee of the city whose duties include enforcement of housing, building,
plumbing, fire, maintenance, or related codes shall be appointed to the
Commission.
   (B)   The Commission shall be charged with the duty of determining whether a
property within city limits is blighted or deteriorated in accordance with the
definition of those terms as hereinabove set forth and of carrying out the
substantive and procedural directives associated with that determination as
herein set forth.
   (C)   The Commission shall conduct its business at meetings scheduled and
held in conformity with the requirements of the Kentucky Open Meetings Act.
Meetings shall be called by the city's Director of Codes Enforcement (the
Director) when and as necessary to consider properties alleged by the Director
to be blighted or deteriorated within the meaning of this chapter.
(Ord. 07-35, passed 11-13-07)
§ 156.04 PROCEDURES.
   (A)   When the city's Director of Codes Enforcement considers any property
within the city to be blighted or deteriorated, the Director shall give to the
owner of the property a Notice and Order setting forth the conditions of the
property which are in violation of local codes or law and a time period for the
correction and abatement of such conditions. Such Notice and Order shall
further state that the property is deemed to be blighted or deteriorated within
the meaning of this chapter and that the failure to make correction and
abatement within the time period set forth will result in the referral of the
matter to the Vacant Property Review Commission for further proceedings in
conformity with this chapter.
   (B)   If the conditions set forth in the Director's Notice and Order are not
in full corrected and abated within the time period therein set forth, the
Director shall:
      (1)   Place the matter on the agendas for the next workshop and formal
meeting of the city's Planning and Zoning Commission for that body's
determination of whether the reuse of the property for residential and related
uses is in keeping with the city's comprehensive plan;
      (2)   If the Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine that the
reuse of the property for residential and related uses is in keeping with the
city's comprehensive plan, the Director shall convene a meeting of the Vacant
Property Review Commission for the purpose of that body's consideration of
whether the property is blighted or deteriorated. The Director shall notify the
owner of the time, date, and location of the meeting and shall advise the City
Clerk of the meeting so as to permit the Clerk to make due advertisement of the
meeting as may be required by applicable law.
   (C)   If after consideration of the evidence adduced before it at such
meeting the Commission shall, by a preponderance of the evidence, find that the
property is vacant and blighted or deteriorated within the meaning of this
chapter, the Commission shall notify the owner of the property or a designated
agent that a determination of blight or deterioration has been made and that
failure to eliminate the conditions causing same shall render the property
subject to condemnation by the city. Such notice shall describe the conditions
that render the property blighted or deteriorated and shall demand correction
and abatement of the conditions within 90 days of the receipt of such notice.
An extension of the 90-day period may be granted by the Commission if it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that such period is
insufficient to correct the conditions cited in the notice.
   (D)   (1)   If correction and abatement in full shall not have been effected
within such period of time as the Commission shall have determined as above set
forth, the Commission shall certify to the city's Board of Commissioners that
the property is blighted or deteriorated. Such certification shall further set
forth the Commission's determination that:
         (a)   The owner of the property or designated agent has been sent a
Notice and Order by the Director to eliminate the conditions which are in
violation of local codes or law within a time certain, that such Notice and
Order further set forth that the property is deemed to be blighted or
deteriorated within the meaning of this chapter and that the failure to make
correction and abatement would result in the matter being referred to the
Vacant Property Review Commission for further proceedings in conformity with
this chapter;
         (b)   The conditions set forth in the Notice and Order were not
corrected and abated within the time period therein set forth;
         (c)   The property is vacant;
         (d)   The Commission has notified the property owner or designated
agent that the property has been determined to be blighted or deteriorated and
the time period for correction of such condition granted by the Commission has
expired and the property owner or agent has failed to comply with the notice;
and
         (e)   The Planning and Zoning Commission has determined that the reuse
of the property for residential and related use is in keeping with the city's
comprehensive plan.
      (2)   The certification and findings required by this section shall be in
writing signed by the chairperson of the Commission and included in the
Commission's report to the city's Board of Commissioners.
   (E)   Notice which may be, or is required to be, given under the terms of
this chapter shall be in writing and sent via first class mail, sufficient
postage prepaid, and certified, return receipt requested, and a copy of any
such notice shall further be posted in a conspicuous place on the property
affected. Unless the owner of the property in question shall have notified the

shall be conclusively presumed to be as appear as such in the records
maintained in the office of the Madison County Property Valuation
Administrator. Notice given in accordance with the foregoing shall be deemed
effective on the date of receipt; provided, however, that same shall
conclusively be deemed to have been received not later than the fifth business

in the future.
   (B)   The sequence of development in the city usually begins with a
determination of how the land is to be used. Following this decision, the land
may need to be divided into additional tracts or parcels (subdivided) before
the final step involving the physical development of the land. This chapter
consists of two primary elements: the use of land and structures and the
division and development of land.
   (C)   The chapter has been written in such a way as to provide a degree of
flexibility in the use and development of land while being careful to protect
the health, safety, and general welfare of citizens. One goal of the chapter is
to present the land use and development process in a format the intended user
understands more easily. A second goal is to recognize that the particular
qualities of the city are distinctive and need to be recognized in the overall
development process. A third goal is to avoid excessive regulations and costs
associated with land use and development decisions.

parking and loading space, as well as to facilitate police and fire protection,
prevent the overcrowding of land, blight, danger, and congestion in the
circulation of people and commodities, and prevent the loss of life, health, or
property from fire, flood, or other dangers. These regulations are also used to

construction or to permit any use or any change of use that does not conform to
the literal terms of the Development Ordinance. The Planning and Zoning
Director and the Chief Enforcement Officer can issue citations for violating
city ordinances.

THE USE OF LAND AND STRUCTURES
§ 157.035 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to classify, regulate, and restrict the
use and location of land and buildings designed for specific uses, to regulate
and determine the area of yards and other open spaces surrounding buildings, to
regulate and limit the density of population, and to realize the general
purposes outlined in §
157.004. The city is divided into land-use districts to accomplish this
purpose.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.036 PROCEDURES.
   The land use districts were established by adopting the original zoning
ordinance and subsequent amendments to the written text and the official zoning
map
   (A)   Amending the text.
      (1)   A proposal to amend the text of this subchapter, may originate with
the Planning Commission or the City Commission. Regardless of the origin of the
proposed amendment, it shall be referred to the Planning Commission before
adoption.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing after notice as
required by KRS Ch. 424 and make a recommendation as to the text of the
amendment and whether the text amendment shall be approved or disapproved,
stating the reasons for its recommendation. In the case of a proposed amendment
originating with the City Commission, the Planning Commission shall make its
recommendations within 60 days of the date of its receipt of the proposed
amendment. It shall take an affirmative vote of a majority of the City
Commission to adopt the proposed amendment.
   (B)   Amending the official map. Before application for amendment to the
official land use management map, the applicant is encouraged to have a
conference with the Administrative Official to discuss the proposed land use
change.
      (1)   Amendment application. A proposal to amend the official land use
management map may originate with the Planning Commission, the City Commission,
or the owner of the property in question. No person who is not a licensed
attorney shall be permitted to appear before the Planning Commission on behalf
of an applicant to represent the applicant relative to the requested land use
change. Any person may appear with an applicant to offer testimony or evidence
concerning the requested land use change. The application for an amendment
shall contain at least the following items:
         (a)   Interests and ownership. The applicant's name, address, and
interest in the application and the name, address, and interest of every
person, firm, or corporation represented by the applicant in the application,
the name and signature of the owner or owners of the entire land area to be
included within the proposed district and all encumbrances of such land and the
names and addresses of owners of all adjacent property. If the applicant is not
the owner, then the owner shall submit an affidavit certifying that the person
acting as a representative has the authority to act on his/her behalf.
         (b)   A copy of the deed(s) of the property in question describing the
property with sufficient particularity to enable the city's GIS Department to
make the necessary changes to the official land use management map, together
with a conceptual boundary map depicting the location of the property in
question. If the deed(s) is insufficient for these purposes, the applicant must
include a current survey and a current surveyor's legal description with the
application.
         (c)   Reason for the amendment. The reason and justification for the
proposed amendment stated in the application is consistent with this division.
         (d)   Effect of the amendment. A statement describing the proposed
amendment's nature, description, and effect on surrounding land uses and
properties must be included.
         (e)   The Planning Commission may require a development plan in
conjunction with the application, and it shall be reviewed by both the
Technical Advisory Committee and the Planning Commission in keeping with
division (C) below. If a development plan is approved as part of the land use
map amendment, a certificate of land use restriction must be filed.
         (f)   Other information specified in the zoning map amendment
application form promulgated by the Planning and Zoning Department includes,
without limitation, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law relating
to the proposed zone change.
      (2)   Planning Commission Action.
         (a)   Following receipt of an application, the Planning Commission
shall fix a time for a public hearing in keeping with the scheduled business
meeting. The applicant shall then give public notice thereof per KRS Ch. 424;
such notice shall include publication at least once and shall be made not less
than seven days nor more than 21 days before the hearing date. The applicant
shall also give notice at least 14 days before the hearing by first-class
certified mail, with a return receipt requested, to the owners of the adjacent
properties. A list of property owners with correct names and addresses shall be
furnished to the Planning Commission, along with copies of all returned
receipts and affidavits of publication as evidence of compliance before the
hearing. In addition, the applicant shall post a notice on the property for 14
consecutive days. This notice shall comply with KRS Ch. 100.212 and any
requirements established by the Planning Commission.
         (b)   If the property classification proposed to be changed adjoins
property in a different planning unit, notice of the hearing shall be given at
least 14 days before the hearing by first class mail to the Planning Commission
of that planning unit. Suppose the property being proposed for a change in land
use classification is part of a proposal for annexation by the city and is
before the Planning and Zoning Commission for that body's recommendation as to
the appropriate land use classification. In that case, the annexation applicant
shall provide to the city's Planning and Zoning Department all of the
information and documentation required for an application for a zoning map
amendment, together with such current survey and certified plat as is necessary
according to applicable provisions of the Kentucky Revised Statutes and
relevant regulations of the office of the Kentucky Secretary of State together
with proposed findings of fact in support of the zoning classification
requested by the annexation applicant. It shall further be the responsibility
of the annexation applicant to comply with every other requirement outlined in
applicable provisions of the Kentucky Revised Statutes relating to annexation,
all as may be amended from time to time.
         (c)   The requirements of this Development Ordinance are based on the
recommendations included in the Comprehensive Plan. Before any amendment to the
official land use management map is granted, the Planning Commission must first
find that the proposed map amendment is in agreement with the Comprehensive
Plan or, in the absence of such a finding, that one or more of the following
apply:
            1.   That the original land use classification given to the
property was inappropriate and that the proposed land use classification is
appropriate; or
            2.   Significant economic, physical, or social changes within the
area were not anticipated in the adopted comprehensive plan, and these have
substantially altered the fundamental character of such an area.
         (d)   The Kentucky Revised Statutes and this Development Ordinance set
specific standards that govern the Planning Commission's consideration of a
land use change application. Applicants are cautioned that unless substantial
evidence is presented to the Planning Commission relating to these specific
standards, the law requires that the Planning Commission recommend that the
application for a land use change be denied.
         (e)   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing and make a
finding of fact, which shall be recorded in the minutes and records of the
Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may vote to approve, reject, or
defer action on the proposed amendment. After voting, the Planning Commission
shall forward its finding of fact and recommendation in writing to the City
Commission. A tie vote shall be subject to further consideration by the
Planning Commission not to exceed 30 days, at the end of which, if the tie has
not been broken, the application shall be forwarded to the City Commission
without a recommendation for approval or disapproval.
      (3)   Action by the City Commission. The appropriate legislative body
shall not act upon a proposed amendment to the official land use management map
until it has received the written finding of fact and recommendation from the
Planning Commission. Suppose the Planning Commission denies the requested map
amendment before the City Commission approves such an amendment. In that case,
it must take a majority vote of the legislative body's membership to override
the Planning Commission's recommendation. When the legislative body has
disapproved an application for a land use map amendment, an additional request
for a change in land use for that tract of land shall not be filed within 12
months of the date of disapproval.
   (C)   Development plan requirements.
      (1)   As referenced in division (B)(1)(e) above, the Planning Commission
may require a development plan in conjunction with a proposal to amend the
official map.
      (2)   An application shall be submitted as part of any development plan
and made on a form provided by the Codes and Planning Officer. The application
shall contain the following information and items indicated on the development
plan checklist (refer to Appendix A).
      (3)   When the Planning Commission has approved a development plan, one
copy shall be returned to the developer for compliance with final approval
requirements. Such approval shall be effective one year from the approval date.
During that time, the general terms and conditions under which the development
plan was granted will not be affected by any changes to these regulations. An
extension of six months may be granted provided the developer submits a written
request to the Planning Commission and is approved. The approval date for each
development plan is the date of the planning and zoning business meeting on
which the plat is approved with or without conditions.
      (4)   Upon receipt of a development plan prepared following the
provisions above, the appropriate Codes and Planning Officer shall immediately
forward copies to the Technical Advisory Committee, reviewing the development
plan for compliance with applicable codes, ordinances, or standards.
      (5)   The reviewing agencies shall review the plan for compliance with
the standards, codes, or ordinances they are responsible for administering.
Within seven days of receiving a development plan, the agencies shall make a
recommendation to the Planning Commission in writing to approve, disapprove, or
approve with modifications or conditions.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.037 CERTIFICATES OF LAND USE RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   When land use restrictions are imposed to include variances,
conditional use permits, conditional land use management conditions, unrecorded
preliminary subdivision plats, and development plans, but not including land
use management map amendments which impose no limitations or restrictions upon
the use of the property other than those generally applicable to properties
within the same land use district and not including any recorded subdivision
plat, a certificate of land use restriction must be completed by the
appropriate body (Planning Commission, Board of Adjustment, or City
Commission), which finally adopts or imposes the land use restriction.
   (B)   The certificates shall be in the format provided in Appendix B to
these regulations. They shall be filed with the County Clerk within 30 days of
the date the body takes final action to impose or adopt the restriction. The
Fiscal Court shall collect the County Clerk's filing fee from the applicant
when any processing is initiated, which may result in the imposition, adoption,
amendment, or release of any land use restriction. The fee shall be refunded to
the applicant if no land use restriction is imposed or adopted as a result of
the proceeding.
   (C)   Upon receipt of the fee, the County Clerk shall file and maintain
these certificates in the office's official records. The County Clerk shall
index the certificates by the property owner and, if applicable, by name of
subdivision or development. The County Clerk shall maintain in the office a
record of the name and address of the agency having custody of the official
land use management map for each planning unit within the county.
   (D)   A new certificate shall be filed when a restriction reflected on the
certificate is amended. In the case of such amendment or if the original
restriction is released, the previous certificate shall be released by the
secretary of the body that amended or released the restriction in the same
manner as releases of encumbrances upon real estate. The failure to file, file
on time, or complete the certificate correctly or accurately shall not affect
the validity or ability to enforce any land use restriction or regulation. A
subsequent proper filing may cure an improper filing. Nothing herein shall
affect the running of time for any appeal or other act for which a time limit
is prescribed in these regulations.
   (E)   When a land use management map amendment is filed for more than five
contiguous properties or a land use restriction is imposed upon two or more
properties or lots in the same proceedings, a single certificate shall be filed
for all the properties or lots collectively, and a single fee shall be paid.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.038 CONDITIONAL USE.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide
applications for conditional use permits to allow the proper integration into
the community of uses, which are specifically named in the land use management
regulations and may be suitable only in specific locations in the district only
if certain conditions are met.
   (B)   The Board may approve, modify, or deny any application for a
conditional use permit. If it approves such a permit, it may attach necessary
conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more things be
done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature.
Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board's minutes and on the
conditional use permit, along with a reference to the specific section in the
regulations listing the conditional use under consideration. The Board shall
have the power to revoke conditional use permits or variances for non-
compliance with the condition thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have a
right of action to compel offending structures or uses to be removed at the
cost of the violator and may have a personal judgment for such cost.
   (C)   Granting a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant from
complying with all building, housing, and other regulations requirements.
   (D)   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised
within the time limit set by the Board or within one year from the date when
the Board granted the permit, if no specific time limit was then set, such
conditional use permit shall conclusively be deemed to have been forever
revoked and lapsed. The use permissible for the property shall revert to what
existed before the grant of the permit.
   (E)   The Chief Enforcement Officer shall review all conditional permits
except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least
once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where
the conditional use is located to ascertain that the landowner is complying
with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use permit.
Suppose the landowner is not complying with the conditions of the conditional
use permit. In that case, the Chief Enforcement Officer shall report the fact
in writing to the Chairman of the Board of Adjustment.
   (F)   The report shall state expressly how the landowner needs to comply
with the conditions of the conditional use permit. A copy of the report shall
be furnished to the landowner at the same time it is furnished to the chairman
of the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall hold a hearing on the report within
a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be
furnished to the landowner at least one week before the hearing.
   (G)   Suppose the Board of Adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the
Chief Enforcement Officer's report are accurate and that the landowner has
taken no steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date
of the hearing. In that case, the Board of Adjustment may authorize the Chief
Enforcement Officer to revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary
legal action to terminate the activity on the land that the conditional use
permit authorizes.
   (H)   Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional use permit
and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be satisfied
entirely and permanently, the Chief Enforcement Officer, upon request of the
applicant, may, if the facts warrant, decide that the conditions have been
satisfied and note the conclusion in the margin of the copy of the conditional
use permit which is on file with the County Clerk as required in KRS 100.329.
After that, said use will be treated as permitted if it continues to meet the
other requirements of the regulations.
   (I)   When an application is made for a conditional use permit for land
located in or abutting any residential district, written notice shall be given
at least 14 days in advance of the public hearing on the application to the
applicant, the Chief Enforcement Officer, and owner of every parcel of property
adjoining the property to which the application applies and such other persons
as the regulations shall direct. Written notice shall be by first-class mail
with certification from the Board's secretary or other officer that the notice
is mailed.
   (J)   It shall be the applicant's duty to furnish to the board the name and
address of any owner of each parcel of property as described in this section.
Records maintained by the property valuation Administrator may be relied upon
to determine the identity and address of said owner. Suppose such property is
in a condominium or cooperative form of ownership. In that case, the person
notified by mail shall be the president or chairperson of the owner group,
which administers property commonly owned by the condominium or cooperative
owners.
   (K)   All conditional use permits approved by the Board of Adjustment shall
be recorded in the County Clerk's office at the applicant's expense.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.039 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board shall have the power to decide on applications for variances
and may impose reasonable conditions or restrictions on any variance it grants.
   (B)   Per KRS 100.243:
   "Before any variance is granted, the board must find that the granting of
the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare,
will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will not cause
a hazard or a nuisance to the public, and will not allow an unreasonable
circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In making these
findings, the board shall consider whether:
      a)   The requested variance arises from special circumstances which do
not generally apply to land in the general vicinity or the same zone;
      b)   The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an
unnecessary hardship on the application; and
      c)   The circumstances are the result of actions of the applicant taken
subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is
sought.
   The board shall deny any request for a variance arising from circumstances
that are the result of willful violations of the zoning regulation by the
applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief
is sought."
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.040 NON-CONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   (1)   The lawful use of a lot or a structure existing at the time of
adoption of any land use regulations affecting it may be continued. However,
such does not conform to the provisions of such regulations except as otherwise
provided herein.
      (2)   A non-conforming use may lapse for one year without being
considered abandoned. The property owner may appeal to the Board of Adjustment
for an additional year before the end of the first year. Any lapse of a non-
conforming use for more than two years will result in the property being
required to conform to existing land use requirements regarding appropriate
uses.
      (3)   A residential dwelling may be built upon a non- conforming lot when
this chapter was adopted, even though such a lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or frontage, or both, that are generally applicable in the district.
However, dimensional requirements other than those applying to the area or
frontage (or both) of the lots shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. Variances must be obtained from the
Board of Adjustment as described in §
157.039.
      (4)   The Board of Adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or
extension of a non-conforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation
when the regulation making it non-conforming was adopted. Nor shall the Board
permit a change from one non- conforming use to another unless the new non-
conforming use is in the same or a more restrictive classification.
      (5)   Should any non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of a
structure be damaged, destroyed, or demolished by any means, it may be
reconstructed or repaired, but not to exceed the number of cubic feet existing
in it and not to extend or enlarge the scope and area of its operation before
its damage, destruction, or demolition.
   (B)   Administrative review. The Board of Adjustments shall have the power
to hear and decide cases where it is alleged by an applicant that there is an
error in any order, requirement, decision, grant, or refusal made by an
administrative official in the enforcement of the land use regulations. Such
appeal shall be made within 30 days.
   (C)   Procedure for appeals to the Board. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment
may be made by any person or entity claiming to be injuriously affected or
aggrieved by an official action or decision of any land use regulations
enforcement officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the
appellant or his agent receives official notice of the action by filing a
notice of appeal with the said officer and the Board specifying the grounds
thereof and giving notice of such appeal to any parties of record. Said officer
shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken and shall be treated as and be the
respondent in such further proceedings. At the public hearing on the appeal
held by the Board, any interested person may appear and enter his appearance,
and all shall be allowed to be heard. The Board will rehear an appeal only in
cases where new evidence is available, or the appealing person or entity
desires a complete transcription for the court record.
   (D)   Public notice of appeal hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time
for hearing the appeal, give public notice per KRS Ch. 424 and written notice
to the appellant and the Planning and Zoning Director at least one week before
the hearing, and decide it within 60 days. The affected party may appear at the
hearing in person or be represented by an attorney.
   (E)   Appeals from the Board of Adjustment. Any person or entity claiming to
be injured or aggrieved by any final action of the Board of Adjustment shall
appeal from the action to the county's Circuit Court in which the property,
which is the subject of the action of the Board of Adjustment, lies. Such
appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the Board's final action. All final
actions, which have not been appealed within 30 days, shall not be subject to
judicial review. The Board of Adjustment shall be a party in any such appeal
filed in the Circuit Court.
§ 157.041 LAND USE CLASSIFICATION AND DESIGNATION.
   This section regulates the use of land and structures within the different
districts to ensure compatibility and consistency with the districts' purposes.
To determine which uses shall be permitted in the various districts, the uses
shall be defined and listed by category in division (A) below.
   (A)   Categories of uses. Three categories of uses are appropriate in
determining the degree of review and regulation of land in the city:
      (1)   Principal or permitted uses. These uses are deemed most appropriate
and permitted outright in a district without granting any special conditions or
the review by anybody other than the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Conditional uses. Depending on the situation, these uses may or may
not be appropriate in a district. For these uses to be approved for a district,
restrictions on location, size, extent, and character of performance may be
required in addition to those already imposed by the ordinance and require
review by the Board of Adjustments.
      (3)   Accessory uses. These uses are subordinate to or complement the
principal use of the land or structure; accessory uses do not require any
further review by the Planning Commission or the Board of Adjustment.
   (B)   Unclassified uses. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall, upon
application to it, determine whether an unclassified use is appropriate within
a given zoning classification, considering the classified uses most closely
related to the proposed use and the zoning classifications in which such uses
are permitted or conditional uses. When the Commission has determined which, if
any, zoning classification is appropriate for the proposed unclassified use, it
shall further determine whether such use shall be a permitted use or a
conditional use within such zoning classification.
   (C)   Land use districts. Land use districts are divisions of land use in
which more specific land use categories are identified. Each district is
described below with the purpose it is designed to serve. Where no permitted
(P) or conditional use (C) is indicated for an allowable use in a land use
district, that use should not be allowed (excluding accessory land uses, which
are covered in §
157.044(B).
      (1)   Residential districts. Residential districts are established to
provide suitable sites and surroundings for dwelling units. This chapter
recognizes that there should be diverse settings to meet individual housing
preferences.
         (a)   R-1A, R-1B, and R-1C Single Family Residential Districts. These
residential districts are designed to provide low to medium-density
neighborhoods of detached single-family residences and related uses and exclude
uses incompatible with residential uses.
            1.   The R-1A District allows up to 3.6 dwelling units per gross
acre.
            2.   The R-1B District allows up to 4.6 dwelling units per gross
acre.
            3.   The R-1C District allows up to 5.1 dwelling units per gross
acre.
         (b)   R-2, Two Family Residential (Duplex) District. This district is
designed to establish neighborhoods of single-family and two-family dwellings
free from other uses incompatible with the district. The density shall not
exceed 5.1 dwelling units per gross acre.
         (c)   R-3, Multi-Family Residential District. This district is
designed to establish areas where multi-family dwelling units are allowed at
densities not exceeding 14.24 per acre.
         (d)   RE, Residential Estates. This district is designed to allow
single-family residential land use in annexed rural/agricultural areas of the
city that are not adjacent to existing developed districts, to encourage a more
harmonious relationship with surrounding land uses, and to promote the
maintenance of open space. The maximum density of Residential Estates shall be
one unit per acre.
         (e)   MP, Mobile Home Park/Community District. This district is
designed to accommodate mobile and manufactured homes in a planned residential
setting with a maximum density of eight units per acre. Mobile home parks shall
comply with state regulations for Kentucky Mobile Home and Recreational Vehicle
Parks as permitted in KRS 219.310 to 219.410. In addition to the requirements
set forth by KRS, each park shall provide a centrally located storm shelter.
Such storm shelters shall be underground unless the Codes Enforcement office
approves engineered drawings for above-ground installations. Space within the
shelter shall be provided at a rate that accommodates all park occupants.
      (2)   Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zone.
         (a)   PUD regulations aim to empower and inspire more creative and
imaginative land development design than possible under district zoning
regulations. PUD allows substantial flexibility in planning and designing a
proposal, providing a canvas for innovative solutions. This flexibility often
accrues relief from compliance with conventional zoning ordinance site and
design requirements.
         (b)   No PUD shall be permitted on less than 40 acres of land.
However, a smaller tract adjacent to an existing PUD Zone may be allowed if the
proposed development conforms to and extends the original development as if the
new area had been a part of it. Please refer to Appendix I for all planned unit
development requirements and procedures.
      (3)   Business Districts. Business districts are established to provide a
diverse range of suitable sites and surroundings for commercial uses. This
chapter recognizes and supports the need for varied settings to meet individual
commercial needs, ensuring adaptability and flexibility in the regulations.
         (a)   B-1, Neighborhood Business District. The purpose of the B-
1 District is to encourage the establishment of areas for convenient type
business uses designed to meet the needs of residents in immediate
neighborhoods. Such districts shall be located with access to a collector
street.
         (b)   B-2, Central Business District. The purpose of the B-2
(Downtown) District is to accommodate and encourage further expansion and
renewal in the historic business core area of the city. Various business,
governmental, residential, and other related uses are provided to provide the
activities necessary to establish a genuinely urban character.
         (c)   B-3, Highway Business District. The purpose of the B-3 District
is to establish areas suitable for highway business uses only. This district is
specifically designed to serve the traveling public. B-3 districts are
generally located at intersections of major arterial streets or interchange
areas along I-75. Strip development is not encouraged.
         (d)   B-4, Planned Shopping Center District. The purpose of the B-
4 District is to encourage the establishment of large clustered areas pre-
planned for business uses. This chapter recognizes different levels of shopping
centers designed to meet the needs of variable-sized market areas:
            1.   Neighborhood shopping center. This shopping center provides
convenience goods for surrounding neighborhoods and is located at the
intersection of collector or major arterial streets, having access to both
streets. The minimum area required is five acres.
            2.   Community shopping center. This shopping center provides goods
for a larger area, including the entire community. These centers shall be
located at the intersection of major arterial streets, having access to both
streets. The minimum area required for a community shopping center is 15 acres.
            3.   Regional shopping center. This shopping center provides goods
for the entire community and outlying areas. A regional shopping center shall
be located at the intersection of two major arterial streets or the interchange
of I-75. The minimum area required for this shopping center is 25 acres.
            4.   P-1, Professional Office District. The purpose of the P-
1 District is to encourage the establishment of groupings of professional,
executive, administrative, and similar service-type uses. These districts shall
be located on collector or arterial streets. The P-1 District is also designed
to act as a buffer between more intensive commercial uses and high-density
residential uses.
      (4)   PSP, Public and Semi-Public District. The purpose of the PSP
District is to provide for public and quasi-public uses, including schools,
parks, universities, government buildings, churches, hospitals, and other
related uses.
      (5)   Industrial Districts. Industrial districts are established to
provide suitable sites and surroundings for industrial uses. This chapter
recognizes that diverse settings should be available to meet individual
industrial needs.
         (a)   I-1, Dispersed Industrial Sites. The purpose of the I-1 District
is to provide for small manufacturing clusters and dispersed industrial sites.
These districts are designed to accommodate industries and wholesale business
establishments, which have a minimal impact on surrounding land uses. This
district may also be a transitional area between more intensive industrial and
less intensive business or residential districts. Other uses, such as fire and
emergency rescue facilities, ambulance and emergent health care facilities,
daycare facilities providing service to industrial employees, and similar uses
that are deemed compatible and consistent with the primary purpose and use in
this district may be approved by the Board of Adjustment as a conditional use,
on a case-by-case basis.
         (b)   I-2, Industrial Park District. The purpose of this district is
to encourage the grouping of both small manufacturers and larger-scale
industries on a pre- planned site. Other uses that support and are compatible
with the primary uses in these districts may be approved by the Board of
Adjustment as a conditional use on a case-by-case basis. Other uses, such as
fire and emergency rescue facilities, ambulance and emergent health care
facilities, daycare facilities providing service to industrial employees, and
similar uses that are deemed compatible and consistent with the primary purpose
and use in this district may be approved by the Board of Adjustment as a
conditional use, on a case-by-case basis.
      (6)   Agricultural Districts. This district provides for land presently
in non-urban uses (farmland, idle or vacant land, dispersed residences, etc.)
being annexed into the city and remaining in these non-urban uses until
development is anticipated. The minimum area required for inclusion in this
district is one acre.
      (7)   Overlay districts. Per KRS 82.660, the city may establish overlay
districts to provide additional design standards and development regulations
within any city area (see §
157.045). Per KRS 82.660, the city may establish overlay districts to provide
additional regulations for design standards and development within any area of
the city determined to be: (a) An area with historical, architectural, natural,
or cultural significance suitable for preservation or conservation. (b) An area
located near a body of water or along an established commercial corridor with a
unique character related to the suitable location for conservation.
         (a)   Provisions for the establishment of an overlay district. The
requirements for the establishment of an overlay district are as follows:
            1.   An accurate description of the boundaries of the district.
            2.   A description of the district's historical, architectural,
cultural, aesthetic, natural, or other distinctive characteristics to be
preserved.
            3.   Delegating responsibility for administering overlay
regulations to an appropriate city government entity according to KRS 82.670.
            4.   The standards, guidelines, or criteria that govern development
within the district preserve, conserve, or protect the district's historical,
architectural, cultural, aesthetic, or other distinctive characteristics. These
standards, guidelines, or criteria may be set descriptively or illustrated and
incorporate established architectural standards or guidelines by reference.
            5.   Upon the effective date of the establishment of an overlay
district, no person shall begin any significant structural change or any
ordinary repairs to any building or structure, change or create any surface
parking lot, or clear a parcel or lot of trees or other major vegetation, or
change the appearance to signage within an overlay district until the city has
issued a permit, without cost, certifying that the person has complied with the
provisions of these regulations. This prohibition shall not apply to emergency
repairs that need to be made to a building or structure within an overlay
district.
            6.   Development plans are required for all proposed development in
overlay districts, per §
157.036(C).
            7.   The body delegated to administer this section shall follow the
procedure described in §
157.045 in establishing an overlay district.
            8.   Overlay district regulations shall not conflict with the
district's land use management regulations. They shall not permit uses
prohibited by underlying district regulations or prohibit uses permitted by
underlying district regulations.
         (b)   Downtown Historic District (DH). The purpose of a Downtown
Historic District is to protect and preserve certain areas or individual
structures and premises designated as having historic or architectural
significance and to encourage uses that will lead to their continuance,
conservation, and improvement in a manner appropriate to the area's heritage.
         (c)   Transportation Corridor District (TC-1). This Transportation
Corridor Overlay District aims to protect and enhance the economic and
aesthetic character of the Robert R. Martin Bypass by ensuring that proper
planning and management principles are followed in future changes proposed for
this area (see the Comprehensive Plan).

4 zoning district is retail-type businesses, the Board of Adjustment should
consider, in addition to the factors to be taken into consideration in
evaluating a request for a conditional use as set forth elsewhere in this
zoning code, the question of the length of time that the area proposed to be
occupied has been unoccupied at the time of the application for a conditional
use.

1   In determining whether any given proposed site would be suitable for the
location of a pet boarding facility, the Board of Adjustments should consider
the following factors:
   (1)   Larger lots or sites should be preferred over smaller ones. An
emphasis should be placed on separating outdoor pet runs or pens from
adjoining property. Greater distances from the outdoor runs or pens to the
adjoining property are preferable to lesser distances.
   (2)   Outdoor pens or runs should be screened from neighboring residential
uses by either landscaping or privacy fencing.
   (3)   Except in unusual circumstances where pens or runs are isolated from
surrounding property, all animals should be indoors before 8:00 p.m.
   (4)   Outdoor runs and pens should be located at the rear of any building
to the extent possible.
   (5)   The types and numbers of the animals to be boarded should be
considered.

1   The Board of Adjustments, in assessing whether a micro-brewery or a
micro-winery is appropriate at any given proposed location, should take
into consideration the size, scope, and appearance of the proposed micro-
brewery or micro-winery contrasted with the nature and appearance of other
businesses in the vicinity; the degree to which the operations and
activities to be performed by the proposed facility will be consistent or
inconsistent with the existing uses of other properties in the vicinity;
together with such other considerations as are pertinent to the question
of whether the proposed facility is appropriate at the particular proposed
location. The Board shall have the right to require the applicant to
submit to it all such information relating to the nature and appearance of
the proposed structure and facilities and the operations and activities
involved as the Board may deem necessary to its consideration of the
requested conditional use permit and, if the permit is to be granted, to
impose such restrictions as it may deem necessary and appropriate.

§ 157.042 THE OFFICIAL LAND USE MAP.
   (A)   For the purpose of administering this chapter, the city is divided
into land use areas and districts, the boundaries of which are shown on the
official land use management map.
   (B)   The official land use management map for the city shall be identified
by the title "Official Land Use Management Map of Richmond, Kentucky”, and
shall bear the signature of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk and bearing
the seal of the city following the statement "This is to certify that this map
is the Official Land Use Management Map of Richmond, Kentucky, as adopted by
Ordinance 06-05 by the City Council on February 28, 2006."
   (C)   If, per the provisions of this chapter and KRS Ch. 100, amendments are
made in the district or overlay district boundaries or other matters portrayed
on the official land use management map of the city, such amendments shall be
made to the official map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the
appropriate governing body with an entry on the official map as follows: "By
official action of the City Commission, this map is amended as authorized by
Ordinance 06-05 which entry shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the
City Clerk.”
   (D)   No changes of any nature shall be made to the official land use
management map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures
outlined in this chapter and in KRS Ch. 100. Any unauthorized change of
whatever kind by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of this
chapter and punishable as provided herein.
   (E)   Regardless of the purported copies of the official land use management
map, which may from time to time be made or published, the official land use
management map, which shall be located in the office of the Planning and Zoning
Director, shall be the final authority as to the current land use
classification of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the
city.
   (F)   In the event the official land use management map becomes damaged,
destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of
changes and additions, the appropriate governing body may adopt a new official
land use management map, which shall supersede the prior map, but no such
correction shall have the effect of amending the original official land use
management map, or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official land use
management map shall be identified by the same signature, seal, and wording
provided in the original map.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.043 INTERPRETATION OF BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists concerning the boundaries of any of the land use
areas or districts as shown on the official land use management map, the
following rules shall apply:
   (A)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines.
   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines or
property lines shall be construed as following such lot lines or property
lines.
   (C)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be
construed as following such city limits.
   (D)   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be considered
midway between the main tracks.
   (E)   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines and, in the event of a change in the shoreline, shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerline of streams, rivers, creeks, or other
natural drainage courses shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
   (F)   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features shown in
divisions (A) through (E) above shall so be construed.
   (G)   Where physical or geographical features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the official land use management map or in other
circumstances not covered by divisions (A) through (B) above, the Planning
Commission shall interpret the district or overlay district boundaries.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)

of the vendor's location within the city.
         (e)   Vendors shall remove their units when they close for business.
      (5)   Annual inspection prior to operation; compliance with applicable
regulations of the Richmond Fire Department and of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky. No vendor shall at any time operate at any location within the city
during any calendar year unless the vendor's mobile food unit used in the city
shall first, in that calendar year, have passed a fire safety inspection
performed by an employee of the Richmond Fire Department certified to act as an
inspector for the Office of the State Fire Marshal. Each vendor shall at all
times be in complete compliance with all regulations of the Richmond Fire
Department and of the Commonwealth of Kentucky pertaining to the condition and
operation of the mobile food unit used in the city.
      (6)   Penalties. Any person in violation of this division shall be

      (2)   No merchandise or signs may be placed in any public way.
      (3)   One sign may be allowed on the site, not more than four square feet
in area and posted not more than 24 hours before the sale, and shall be removed
immediately after the sale.
   (F)   Fences, walls, and hedges.
      (1)   Fences, walls, and hedges serve to enclose similar land uses and to
separate different land uses. They also serve as buffers to screen activities
that might be inharmonious. There are two types of these devices;
         (a)   Those that do not impede visibility by more than 20%; and
         (b)   Those that do impede visibility by more than 20%.
      (2)   Type 1 includes but is not limited to chain link, woven wire, split
rail, and other similar fences and low-density vegetative screens. These
devices shall be permitted in any rear or side yard in any district, in the
front yard of an agricultural district, and in the front yard of a residential
district, provided they do not exceed four feet in height and do not interfere
with vehicular visibility.
      (3)   Type 2 includes but is not limited to masonry walls, board and
stockade fences, and chain link fences with inserts. These devices shall be
permitted in the rear yard in any district provided it shall not exceed six
feet in height.
      (4)   No improvements shall be placed on the drainage or utility
easements unless approved by the Planning and Zoning Office.
      (5)   Barbed wire, electrified fences, or similar protection devices
shall not be permitted in any residential district or adjacent to any
residential use in the city. These devices shall be permitted in agricultural
districts in conjunction with agricultural uses.
   (G)   Storage of vehicles. Storage of recreational vehicles, including
campers, boats and trailers, motor homes, off- road vehicles, and other non-
licensed vehicles, may be stored in any district, provided that:
      (1)   Recreational vehicles shall not be stored in the front yard, on the
front driveway, or in the street.
      (2)   No more than two recreational vehicles may be stored on any lot,
and their storage shall not impede the visibility of vehicular or pedestrian
traffic.
      (3)   Recreational vehicles may not be stored in any public way for more
than 24 hours.
      (4)   Only operable, functional recreational vehicles possessing current
vehicle registration are permitted when registration is required. No commercial
trucks shall be stored on residential property.
      (5)   Only recreational vehicles registered to the occupant may be stored
on the occupant's lot.
   (H)   Outdoor uses. Unless specifically permitted elsewhere in this chapter,
all usages, including storage or displays, shall be conducted entirely within
completely enclosed structures. The following shall be exempted from this
requirement:
      (1)   Uses located within commercial or industrial districts.
      (2)   Agricultural uses within any district.
      (3)   Commercial storage or display of automobiles, trucks, boats, or
recreational vehicles.
      (4)   Trash dumpsters, compactors, or receptacles, firewood, and similar
materials. These uses shall be located in the rear or side yard and screened
from public view.
   (I)   Separate building site required. Unless specifically permitted
elsewhere in this chapter, a separate building site shall be provided for each
individual building or use, except for permitted accessory building or
accessory uses.
   (J)   Visibility at intersections. Nothing shall be placed, erected,
planted, or allowed to grow on a corner lot in such a manner as to materially
impede vision in the area bounded by the street lines of such corner and a line
joining points along said street lines. Refer to the Access Management and
Roadway Manual, Chapter 3, for specific dimensions. Corner lots shall be graded
to proper elevations to comply with this provision.
   (K)   Yard requirements at district boundaries. Whenever two different
districts adjoin, the minimum width and depth requirements of both adjoining
front, side, and rear yards shall be the more restrictive of the two districts.
   (L)   Landscaping. In the city, a landscape plan shall be submitted with
subdivision plats or development plans or the building permit applications (as
appropriate), for review and approval by the Landscape Committee.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of these landscape requirements is to enhance
the aesthetic qualities of development and to minimize the friction that might
occur between different land uses. In addition, the planting of trees, shrubs,
and ground cover, and the use of fences, walls, and earthen mounds help to
retard erosion, channel vehicular and pedestrian circulation, protect
surrounding property values, reduce the effects of air, odor, visual, and noise
pollution, and reduce glare from outdoor lighting.
      (2)   Developer’s responsibility. The landscape requirements set forth in
this section shall be provided as a condition of development by the developer
or owner of the property being developed. An owner securing a change in land
use classification which creates a different situation shall be the one deemed
responsible for creating the different situation, and shall provide the
required landscape buffer as a condition of such land use change. If the
different situation already exists or is created by a general land use change
not sponsored by the property owner, the landscape buffer shall be provided as
a condition of the approval of any subdivision of the affected land.
      (3)   Compliance. The Planning and Zoning Director shall be responsible
for insuring compliance with this section as part of the subdivision plat or
development plan review. The Planning and Zoning Director shall inspect the
premises prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy to ensure that the
landscape buffer is in place. If, due to seasonal variance, planting is not
practical at the time required for the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy, the developer shall post a bond to cover the cost of the landscape
buffer, shall plant the landscape buffer as soon as reasonably possible, and
shall notify the Planning and Zoning Director who will inspect the landscape
buffer to ensure that it is in compliance with these regulations.
      (4)   Exceptions. In a situation where by reason of exceptional
topographic, dimensional, shape, or other special conditions, the enforcement
of this section would create an undue hardship on the applicant, the applicant
may request a variance or waiver of such requirements.
      (5)   Relationship to yard requirements. The landscape buffer areas set
forth in this section shall be included in the minimum yard required by the
land use district where the development occurs. If the buffer area exceeds the
yard requirement, the yard requirement shall be extended to accommodate the
buffer.
      (6)   Buffer area conflicts. Where landscape buffers are required in the
same location as utility easements, the two may be combined, providing that the
total width and screening requirements are met and it is not in violation of
any required utility easements.
      (7)   Provisions of planting materials and barriers. Such trees, shrubs,
ground covers, and barriers, as required, shall be provided by the developer by
the developer or owner and considered as any other site improvement.
      (8)   Inclusion on subdivision plats and development plans. Areas to be
set aside for landscape buffer areas shall be shown on the subdivision plat or
development plan. In addition, each lot shall have on shade tree planted for
each 50 feet of street frontage. Unless otherwise specified, trees shall have a
minimum trunk size of two inches in diameter. Plants shall be nursery grown and
adapted to the local area.
      (9)   Maintenance of landscape buffer. The property owner shall maintain
landscape buffer and trees.
      (10)   Minimum landscape buffer requirements. The landscape buffers as
described below shall apply to all common boundaries between different "land
uses". The buffer effect may be accomplished by trees or shrubs and barriers in
any combination that achieves the objectives of these requirements. In
addition, ground cover shall be provided in the form of grass, low shrubs, or
mulch. Plants shall be those that are acclimated to the local environment.

      (11)   Screening fence or wall. If a fence or wall is used to provide
screening, it shall be constructed such that visibility through any portion of
the fence or wall is not greater than 80%. The fence or wall shall be of
sufficient height to accomplish the purpose for which it is designed but shall
not be greater than eight feet, nor less than four feet in height. The fence or

screening is blocked by at least 80% throughout the year. The effective
screening height of the trees or shrubs shall be at least four feet in height
at the time of planting.
      (13)   Landscaping in parking lots. A landscape plan is required for all

§ 157.045 OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Downtown Historic District.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the Downtown Historic District is to
protect, perpetuate, and encourage the non-destructive use of the structures
and districts as having substantial historic, cultural, or architectural
importance within the city; to increase community pride and enhance the
identity of the city by protecting the city's heritage and prohibiting the
avoidable destruction or defacement of its cultural assets; to strengthen the
city's economic base by encouraging the preservation of its viable and
distinctive neighborhoods; to prevent creation of environmental influences
adverse to such purposes; and to assure that new structures and uses within the
district will be in keeping with the character of the area to be reserved and
enhanced.
      (2)   Application of regulations. The Downtown Historic District
classification and regulations there under shall be in addition to existing
land use classification and management regulations applicable to the area. The
area included in the Downtown Historic District is shown on the map entitled
"Downtown Richmond" in the Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   Procedures for establishment of historic districts. The procedures
for establishing historic districts shall be as follows.
         (a)   Application. An application for the establishment of a historic
district may be filed only by the Board of Architectural Review, the Planning
Commission, the Richmond Commission, the owner of the subject property, or by a
person with written authorization of the owner. Said application shall be filed
with the Board of Architectural Review on the appropriate form. Upon the filing
of an application by a governmental body, the Board of Architectural Review
shall promptly notify the owner(s) by certified mail.
         (b)   Review and recommendation by the Board of Architectural Review.
Upon the filing of an application for the establishment of a historic district,
the Board of Architectural Review shall study and review the application.
Before taking action on the application, the Board shall give proper notice of
a public hearing thereon in the same manner as prescribed for other amendments
to the land use management map. The public hearing shall be conducted within 60
days after the filing date, and the Board's recommendations shall be submitted
in writing to the Planning Commission.
         (c)   Action by the Planning Commission and the City Commission. The
Planning Commission and City Commission shall follow the procedures for
amending the official land use management map as described in §
157.036(B).
         (d)   The Board of Architectural Review. The Board of Architectural
Review shall consist of five members appointed by the Mayor of Richmond with
the approval of the City Commission as provided for in Chapter 155. The Board
shall consist of at least one member of the architectural or related
profession, the real estate profession, a resident or business occupant of a
historic district in the city, and a person who has displayed an active
involvement in historic preservation.
         (e)   Board Authority. The Board shall not consider interior
arrangement or use, but shall consider the historic or architectural qualities
of the exterior of the contributing buildings concerned and the relationship of
the contributing buildings to all others in the district so as to avoid
incongruity and promote harmony therewith. In all instances the Board shall
regulate those outside surfaces of a contributing building that can be viewed
from a public right-of-way or street. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to prevent ordinary maintenance or repairs, which do not involve a
change of design, material, or of the outward appearance of a building. The
authority of the Board shall apply in such cases of material change as painting
previously unpainted masonry, sandblasting wood or masonry, or repainting
masonry walls.
         (f)   Procedures.
            1.   Before a person may undertake any exterior changes to any
property or structure in a historic district (to include demolition), a
certificate of appropriateness shall be required. The individual must apply for
the certificate on a form provided by the Codes and Planning Office. All
applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the
Board at a public hearing, except where the Board has granted the Building
Inspector the authority to review an application without a public hearing or
Board action. Notice of the hearing shall be given by first class letter to all
surrounding property owners at least 14 days prior to the hearing and give
notice of the hearing by publication in the newspaper of highest circulation in
Richmond, Kentucky, not earlier than 21 or later than seven days before the
public hearing.
            2.   At the public hearing, the Board shall consider the request
for a certificate of appropriateness by examining the staff report, and hearing
testimony of the applicant, and interested citizens speaking in favor or in
opposition of the proposed changes. In review of material submitted, the Board
shall examine the architectural design and the exterior surface treatment of
the proposed construction on the site in question and its relationship to other
structures within the area, the relationship of the proposed construction to
the design of the building and other pertinent factors affecting the appearance
and efficient functioning of the historic district or structure. The Board
shall vote to approve or disapprove all or a part of the application within 90
days after the completed application is filed. If the application is approved,
the Building Inspector shall promptly issue the certificate of appropriateness.
The applicant may then apply for a building permit to begin work. If the
application is disapproved, the Board shall promptly transmit a written report
stating the reasons for such disapproval to the applicant. A new application
for the same property shall not be submitted until one year has passed.
            3.   If the Board of Architectural Review disapproves an
application for a building permit in an historic district, the applicant of
said permit may appeal to the Planning Commission, which shall hold a public
hearing thereon and shall vote on said appeal within 90 days after the notice
of appeal is filed with the Commission. If the Commission finds that the
application for a building permit conforms to the intent of the historic
district regulations and it votes to approve the application, the Commission
shall issue a certificate of appropriateness to the applicant and transmit a
copy to the Building Inspector. In such cases, no building permit or
certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the Building Inspector on said
application for one year from the date of the decision by the Commission. After
one year has passed, the Building Inspector shall issue the building permit
provided the applicant meets all other requirements of law.
            4.   Any person or persons aggrieved by any decision affecting an
historic district shall have the right to file a civil suit within 30 days from
the date of the decision in a court of competent jurisdiction under the usual
rules of procedure governing orders and injunctive relief provided the
situation warrants it. If the Board fails to act upon the application within 90
days after the application has been filed (unless there is an agreement for an
extension), the application shall be deemed approved.
            5.   For a complete description of the requirements of Historic
Districts, see Appendix F.
   (B)   Transportation Corridor District (Robert R. Martin Bypass, TC-1).
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the Transportation Corridor District is to
protect and enhance the economic and aesthetic character of selected
transportation corridors by insuring that property planning and management
principles are followed in future changes proposed for these areas.
      (2)   Criteria and specifications. The Comprehensive Plan describes
proposed corridors to be developed in the future. Selected highways and
arterial streets are of critical importance to the city. They carry high
volumes of traffic, serve as entryways for visitors and residents, and are
indicators of the quality of life found in the city. Standards are provided to
ensure that traffic moves efficiently, that land uses are harmonious, and that
the area is visually attractive.
      (3)   Applicability. The Transportation Corridor District is intended to
be applied to areas parallel to the rights-of-way of selected major highways
and arterial streets for a depth of 750 feet on either side of centerline of
the highway. The district is measured perpendicular to the right-of-way except
at intersection where it may be expanded to allow for exit and entry ramps. The
actual boundaries shall be determined at the time of adoption of the district
and shall be shown on the official land use management map.
      (4)   Buffer requirements. Landscape buffers are required parallel to the
rights-of-way on properties within the transportation corridor. Buffers shall
be a minimum of 20 feet in width. In determining the need for additional buffer
widths, the Planning Commission shall consider the topography of the area, the
existing and proposed land uses, the size of adjacent parcels, the traffic
volumes of the corridor, and any additional factors the Commission deems
reasonable in carrying out the purpose of this section. District buffer
requirements are described in §
157.044(L)(10).
      (5)   Service roads. In order to facilitate the efficient movement of
traffic, and to reduce the number of access points onto the major highway or
arterial street where possible, a parallel service road shall be constructed as
part of the proposed development. Parallel service roads shall be set back from
the highway right-of-way a minimum of 250 feet measured to the proposed service
road right-of-way and shall be tied into such service roads on adjacent
properties as they are developed.
      (6)   Procedures. Corridor overlay districts may be proposed by the City
Commission or the Planning Commission by filing an application with the
appropriate Administrative Official. The application shall clearly identify the
essential character or qualities of the area that is to be protected by
establishment of the district. The Planning Commission shall review the
proposed designation in a public hearing as spelled out in §
157.036(B)(2). The City Commission shall act on the Planning Commission's
findings in keeping with the provisions of §
157.036(B)(3).
      (7)   Future development. Once a transportation corridor district has
been approved, any proposed development within that corridor shall be subject
to these requirements in addition to the existing requirements of the
underlying district. Such plats or development plans must be approved by the
Planning Commission in accordance with appropriate sections of this chapter.

Chapter 155
§ 157.046 MOTOR VEHICLE PARKING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The requirements of this chapter are intended to provide off-
street parking, queuing, and loading facilities in proportion to the need
created by each land use by establishing requirements regulating the quantity
and design of off-street parking areas to relieve traffic congestion and to
minimize potential.
   (B)   Relationship to the Comprehensive Plan. The parking and loading
standards prescribed by this chapter are intended to implement land development
code provisions that are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan's goals,
objectives, and policies, in accordance with KRS Ch. 100.
   (C)   Applicability.
      (1)   The requirements of this chapter shall apply to all parking and
loading areas in all districts, whether required by this Land Development Code
or created for the convenience of property owners or users. No certificate of
occupancy shall be provided unless and until the appropriate motor vehicle
parking and loading facilities are provided in compliance with this chapter.
All ADA parking spaces provided must meet ADA requirements in effect at time of
construction approval.
      (2)   Each application for a building permit shall include sufficient
information or plans to enable the Administrative Official to determine whether
or not the requirements of this section have been met, to include:
         (a)   Location and dimensions of all parking spaces, driveways,
aisles, and pedestrian walkways as per this chapter and the Access Management
and Roadway Manual.
         (b)   Provisions for pedestrian and vehicular circulation, lighting,
and drainage.
         (c)   Number of anticipated employees, company-owned vehicles,
building rooms, offices, square footage, or other related information for
determining the number of spaces required.
         (d)   Landscaping plan.
      (3)   All required off-street parking should be located on the same
building site, or on a site adjacent to the land use served.
      (4)   Collective off-street parking may be provided; however, the
required number of spaces provided shall not be less than would otherwise be
required individually.
   (D)   Parking spaces required/allowed. The minimum and maximum number of
parking spaces required/allowed is based upon both the use and the zone/
division in which that use is located. To determine the minimum number of
parking spaces required and the maximum allowed, locate the applicable zone/
division in which the use is located and apply that standard to the
requirements associated with the specific use located in
Table 157.046.1.
   (E)   Non-conforming parking. A use or structure with non- conforming off-
street parking (insufficient off-street parking to meet the current land use
requirements in compliance with
Table 157.046.1, below) may be physically enlarged (e.g., expansion of
structure or outdoor land use) or undergo a change in use in compliance with
the following provisions.
      (1)   Residential uses. No additional parking spaces shall be required;
provided, the change does not increase the number of dwelling units, nor
eliminate the only portion of the site that can be used for the required or
existing parking or access. Structures that are at least 50 years of age are
not subject to the minimum parking requirements, but are subject to the maximum
parking requirements listed in
Table 157.046.1.
      (2)   Non-residential uses. The number of existing parking spaces shall
be maintained on the site and additional parking spaces shall be provided in
compliance with this chapter and division. If the use is enlarged (e.g.,
expansion of structure or outdoor land use) so that it requires more parking
than the previous use, only the number of parking spaces required for the
enlargement shall be required to be added to the existing parking spaces. If
the use of the structure is changed to one that requires more parking than the
previous use, only the difference between the number of parking spaces required
for the previous use and those required for the new use shall be required to be
added to the existing parking spaces. The change shall not eliminate the only
portion of the site that can be used for the required or existing parking or
access. Structures that are at least 50 years of age are not subject to the
minimum parking requirements, but are subject to the maximum parking
requirements listed in
Table 157.046.1.
   (F)   Parking requirements for uses not listed or to be determined. For uses
not listed in
Table 157.046.1 or listed as to be determined in
Table 157.046.1, the Administrative Official or designee is authorized to do
any of the following:
      (1)   Apply the minimum or maximum off-street parking space requirement
specified in
Table 157.046.1 for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed
use as determined by the Administrative Official or designee. This
determination shall be based on the operating characteristics of the use, the
most similar related occupancy classification, or other factors related to
potential parking demand.
      (2)   Establish the minimum off-street parking space and loading
requirements based on a parking study prepared by the applicant in accordance
with division (O) below.
   (G)   Different use areas.
      (1)   The number of parking spaces shall be computed based on the primary
uses on the site except as stated below. Where there are two or more separate
primary uses on a site, the required or allowed parking for the site shall be
the sum of the primary uses. For joint-use parking provisions, see division (M)
of this chapter.
      (2)   When more than 20% of the gross floor area of all buildings on a
site is in an accessory use, the required or allowed parking shall be
calculated separately for the accessory use.
      (3)   An accessory use constituting 20% or less of the gross floor area
of all buildings on a site shall be calculated independently when the accessory
use is specified in the parking requirements for the primary use found in
Table 157.046.1.
   (H)   Calculations.
      (1)   When the calculation of the number of required or allowed parking
spaces result in fractions, any fraction less than one-half shall be
disregarded and any fraction of one-half or more shall be rounded up to the
next whole number.
      (2)   If the maximum number of parking spaces allowed is less than one,
then the maximum number is automatically increased to one.
      (3)   If the maximum number of parking spaces allowed is less than or
equal to the minimum number required, then the maximum number is automatically
increased to one more than the minimum.
      (4)   Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining
parking space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the gross horizontal
area of all floors of a non-residential building.
      (5)   Where seating capacity is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of
seating units as determined by code.
      (6)   Where the required parking is determined by the number of
employees, the maximum number of employees on duty on the premises at one time,
or any two successive shifts, whichever is greater, shall be used.
      (7)   When the building floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements and that number is less than the minimum
standard, the minimum standard shall apply and at least one parking space shall
be provided on the premises.
      (8)   For development of potentially mixed uses, parking requirements
shall be determined based on the most restrictive of the uses.
   (I)   Off-street parking reductions.
      (1)   A 10% reduction in the minimum required number of spaces shall
apply to any development within 1,000 feet of a designated transit route.
      (2)   A 10% reduction in the minimum required number of spaces shall
apply to any mixed-use development site (for the purposes of this provision
mixed use means a development site that contains both residential and non-
residential principal uses) that incorporates at least 25% of the gross floor
area of the development site to residential use. An additional 10% reduction
for the development site shall be applicable to developments that incorporate
at least one mixed use structure (for the purposes of this provision mixed use
means a structure that contains both residential and non-residential principal
uses) that contains a minimum of five residential units.
      (3)   An area equal to that needed to provide up to 10% of the parking
spaces required for retail uses may be delineated from the balance of the
parking lot with removable barriers and be used as open space, recreational
facilities or outdoor sales/display area during the non-peak period (January
15th to November 15th or any other ten-month non-peak period approved by the
Administrative Official).
      (4)   A 20% reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces required
shall apply to any development that rehabilitates a structure that is eligible
for or currently listed on the National Register for Historic Places in
accordance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic
Preservation, or Sustainable Permit Projects.
      (5)   A 20% reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces required
shall apply to any development that exceeds the minimum tree canopy required by
5%.
      (6)   A parking waiver from the Board of Adjustment must be obtained to
reduce the minimum number of required parking spaces, except as provided above.
      (7)   To exceed the maximum number of parking spaces permitted, a parking
waiver must be obtained from the Board of Adjustment, except when those spaces
in excess of the maximum allowed are located within a structured parking
facility.
   (J)   The following shall not count towards the maximum number of parking
spaces:
      (1)   Off-street parking spaces used as electric vehicle charging
stations on a lot/parcel of land.
      (2)   Off-street parking spaces designated for curbside pickup or
associated drive through waiting spaces.
      (3)   Off-street parking spaces located within structured parking
facilities or elevated parking systems.
      (4)   Off-street parking spaces designated for handicap accessible
parking.
      (5)   Off-street parking spaces designated for car-pool or van-pool.
      (6)   Off-street parking spaces designated for vacuum stations associated
with a car wash.
      (7)   Off-street parking spaces designated for passenger drop-off and
pick-up.
      (8)   Off-street parking associated with mail centers/clusters.
      (9)   Off-street parking associated with dog parks or recreation
facilities in a residential zone.

   (K)   Location of parking on lot.
      (1)   Off-street parking is prohibited in all required building setbacks
unless specifically authorized by the Administrative Official.
      (2)   Parking for single-family residential uses and duplexes is
permitted in the required front or street side yard only on a hard surface or
approved semi-pervious driveway that does not exceed 20 feet in width and that
leads to a garage, carport, house or rear yard. Parking on approved circular
driveways may be permitted as long as the circular driveway has been approved
by the Administrative Official or designee.
   (L)   Off-site parking.
      (1)   Parking spaces required by this chapter may be located off-site on
property under the same ownership as the use the parking spaces are intended to
serve. Such parking spaces must be located within 1,000 feet of the buildings
or uses requiring the parking. The 1,000 feet requirement shall be measured by
the shortest walking distance (using sidewalks and designated crosswalks) from
the nearest point of the property on which the parking spaces are located, to
the nearest point of the property on which the use is located and which the
parking is intended to serve. The site must be properly zoned and have all
proper approvals for automobile parking areas.
      (2)   Parking spaces required by this chapter may be located on property
under separate ownership from the use the parking is intended to serve as long
as the following conditions are satisfied.
         (a)   The applicant(s) demonstrates that one or more uses located off-
site exceed the minimum number of parking spaces required by this chapter and
are willing to allocate a certain number of the excess spaces to another use to
meet its minimum number of required spaces.
         (b)   The site is properly zoned and has all proper approvals for
automobile parking areas.
         (c)   Off-site parking spaces must be located within 1,000 feet of the
buildings or uses requiring the parking. The 1,000 feet requirement shall be
measured by the shortest walking distance (using sidewalks and designated
crosswalks) from the nearest point of the property on which the parking spaces
are located, to the nearest point of the property on which the use is located
and which the parking is intended to serve.
         (d)   All parties shall execute a properly drawn legal instrument/
agreement providing for the use of the off-site parking spaces.
            1.   This instrument shall be drawn to the satisfaction of the
Planning Commission’s attorney and shall be executed by all parties concerned
assuring the availability of the number of spaces designated for off-site use
and shall be recorded in the County Clerk’s Office.
            2.   No lease, easement or license of parking spaces may be
canceled without 60 days prior written notice to the Administrative Official
and a copy of the signed lease, easement, license or agreement must be filed
with the application.
            3.   The applicants and their successors shall annually provide
certification to the Administrative Official that the parking spaces associated
with the off-site parking agreement are still available.
            4.   The applicant shall provide the Administrative Official with
immediate written notice at any time that any of the parking spaces associated
with the off-site parking agreement become unavailable and shall have 30 days
from the time that the parking spaces associated with the off-site parking
agreement became unavailable to provide the required number of parking spaces
or to apply for a parking waiver to reduce the required number of spaces.
            5.   The certificate of occupancy of the use shall be conditioned
upon the continued availability of the required number of parking spaces.
   (M)   Joint use parking. The Administrative Official or designee may
authorize the joint use of required parking spaces when two or more uses on the
same or separate properties are able to share the same parking spaces because
their peak parking demands occur at different times. Any joint use parking site
must be properly zoned and have all proper approvals for automobile parking
areas. Joint use of off-street parking spaces shall be subject to the
following:
      (1)   A parking study that conforms to the requirements of division (O)
below shall be submitted by the applicants.
      (2)   The number of parking spaces which may be credited against the
requirements for the structures or uses involved shall not exceed the number of
spaces reasonably anticipated to be available during any hours of operation.
      (3)   The joint parking spaces must be located within 1,000 feet of the
buildings or uses being served by such facility, measured by the shortest
walking distance (using sidewalks and designated crosswalks) from the nearest
point of the property on which the parking facility is located, to the nearest
point of the property on which the use is located and which the parking is
intended to serve. Additionally, signage shall be provided identifying any
parking spaces that are being leased or jointly used, who those spaces are
available to, and any other restrictions (e.g time available) that may apply.
The location and size of such signage shall be required as part of the joint
use agreement and shall be subject to review and approval by the Planning
Commission or its designee.
      (4)   Off-street parking areas required for residential use shall not be
included in any joint parking arrangement.
      (5)   All parties shall execute a properly drawn legal instrument/
agreement providing for the joint use of the off-street parking areas.
         (a)   This instrument shall be drawn to the satisfaction of the
Planning Commission’s attorney and shall be executed by all parties concerned
assuring the availability of the number of spaces designated for joint use and
shall be recorded in the County Clerk’s Office.
         (b)   The applicants and their successors shall annually provide
certification to the Administrative Official that the parking spaces associated
with the joint use agreement are still available.
         (c)   The applicant shall provide the Planning Commission with
immediate written notice at any time that any of the parking spaces associated
with the joint use agreement become unavailable and shall have 30 days from the
time that the parking spaces associated with the joint use agreement became
unavailable to provide the required number of parking spaces or to apply for a
parking waiver to reduce the required number of spaces.
         (d)   The certificate of occupancy of the use shall be conditioned
upon the continued availability of the required number of parking spaces.
   (N)   Stacked parking. (Parking within a driveway shall not be considered
stacked parking.)
      (1)   The use of stacked or valet parking may be used to meet the minimum
number of parking spaces required if an attendant will always be present when
the lot is in operation and upon Planning Commission approval.
      (2)   The use of stacked parking may be permitted by the Planning
Commission for any office or industrial use without an attendant present if the
parking spaces used in this manner are designated for employee use only.
      (3)   The specific design and layout of stacked or valet parking areas
shall be approved by the Planning Commission.
   (O)   Use of required parking spaces. The following shall apply to the use
of required parking spaces and areas:
      (1)   Required parking spaces must be available for the use of residents,
customers, visitors or employees of the use. They may not be assigned in any
way to a use on another site, except where the joint use parking provisions are
employed (see division (G) above).
      (2)   Fees may be charged for the use of required parking spaces.
      (3)   Required parking spaces and areas shall not be used for the
display, advertisement, sale, repair, dismantling or wrecking of any vehicles,
equipment or materials.
      (4)   Buildings or structures shall be permitted for shelters for guards,
attendants or watchmen; however, any such structure shall not occupy required
parking spaces and shall be appropriately delineated on the approved
development plan.
   (P)   Surfacing and facility type. All off-street parking areas and access
driveways except for those serving agricultural uses shall be of a hard and
durable surface such as asphalt, brick, concrete paving and interlocking paving
blocks, including semi-pervious systems that retain space for vegetation, are
acceptable paving materials. Other paving materials (including gravel) may only
be permitted for equipment and goods storage only upon approval by the
Administrative Official but must include a binding agent to stabilize the
surface and prevent dust. No motor vehicle including but not limited to
recreational vehicles shall be parked or stored on grass or any other surface
that does not meet the above criteria.
   (Q)   Striping. All off-street parking spaces, except for those serving
detached single-family uses and agricultural uses, shall be delineated using
durable painted lines that meet the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) standards.
   (R)   Wheel stops and protective curbing. Concrete wheel stops or curbing at
least six inches high and six inches wide shall be provided to prevent vehicles
from overhanging abutting sidewalks, properties or public rights-of-way, to
protect landscaped areas and to protect adjacent properties. Such wheel stops
or curbing shall be located at least three feet from any adjacent wall, fence,
property line, woody vegetation, walkway or structure.
   (S)   Landscaping. Parking area landscaping shall be provided in accordance
with the adopted landscape requirements identified in the City Landscape
Manual. Additionally, any parking facilities that provide parking for five or
more vehicles shall provide screening, as defined by this code, on each side of
any parking area that abuts a residential district or use.
   (T)   Lighting. Parking area lighting shall be provided in accordance with §
157.049 of this code.
   (U)   Litter receptacles. All off-street parking areas serving retail uses
and restaurants shall provide at least one outdoor litter receptacle within the
parking area or at the building entrance. One additional outdoor litter
receptacle shall be provided within the parking area or at the building
entrance for each 75 parking spaces located on the site.
   (V)   Handicapped parking spaces. Handicapped parking spaces shall be
provided as required by local ordinances or federal or state law. All

major entrances of the use for which they are provided;
      (2)   The disabled individual is not compelled to wheel or walk behind
parked cars other than his or her own; and
      (3)   A pedestrian way accessible to physically disabled persons shall be
provided from each parking space to related facilities including curb cuts and/
or ramps.

spaces shall be incorporated into the parking lot plan to preclude the parking
of standard size vehicles in compact vehicle spaces.
   (Z)   Motorcycle parking. A commercial or other non-residential development
may substitute motorcycle spaces for required automobile spaces at the rate of
one motorcycle space for each 25 automobile spaces, up to a maximum of 5% of
the minimum required motor vehicles spaces. No more than one motorcycle space
shall be permitted per row of parking.
   (AA)   Drainage. Any off-street parking area for five or more vehicles and
its access drives shall be graded and drained so that the natural flow of
surface water shall not be channeled or concentrated onto adjacent property by
means other than a designated drainage course.
   (BB)   Visibility. Access of driveways for parking areas shall be located in
such a way that any vehicle entering or leaving such a parking area shall be
clearly visible by any pedestrian or motorist approaching the access or
driveway from a public street, private street, or alley. Refer to the Access
Management and Roadway Manual, Chapter 3.
   (CC)   Parking of commercial vehicles. Commercial vehicles with or without

      (2)   Except for single-family dwellings and duplexes, each off-street
parking space shall open directly upon a private aisle or private driveway of
such width and design as to provide a safe and efficient means of vehicular
access between the parking space and public streets. Parking spaces shall be
designed to preclude vehicles backing from or onto a public street. Non-
residential off-street parking facilities designed for vehicles backing from or
onto an alley may be allowed at the discretion of the Administrative Official.
      (3)   The location, width, and number of entrance and exit driveways
serving public accessory parking facilities, drive-in businesses, fee parking
lots, and public parking lots, shall be planned in such a manner as not to
interfere with either the use of adjacent property or the flow of traffic on
the streets to which they connect. Interconnection between o? street parking
areas shall be provided.
      (4)   Location and other criteria for construction of curb cuts shall be
approved by the Administrative Official. Refer to the Access Management and
Roadway Manual for construction guidance.

driveway accessing the garage.
      (9)   Parking of vehicles in any parking lot shall be by marked stalls
only.
   (EE)   Parking space and aisle dimensions.
      (1)   The dimensions of off-street parking spaces and associated drive

width for compact space parking areas is 20 feet. The width of motorcycle
spaces shall be at least five feet.
      (2)   Parking structures developed to provide the minimum number parking
spaces required by this section must meet the minimum dimensional requirements
specified in
Table 157.046.2. The design and layout of all other parking structures,
including but not limited to those used to create parking spaces in excess of
the maximum allowed for a particular use and those for-profit parking
structures not associated with any particular use, shall be approved by the
Planning Commission.
      (3)   Parking spaces serving single-family residential developments
located within driveways and garages need only meet the stall width and stall
depth to wall standards set forth in
Table 157.046.2.

   (FF)   General design criteria.
      (1)   The parking areas of all developments shall be designed so that
sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such
developments without the necessity of making hazardous turning movements.
      (2)    Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed
safely without posing a danger to pedestrians, bicyclists, or other vehicles
and without interfering with parking areas. This includes the provision for
"stop", "yield", "speed limit", "do not enter" and other traffic signs at
appropriate locations.
      (3)   Vehicles parked on private driveways shall be arranged to avoid
pedestrian/vehicle conflict (i.e. vehicles should not extend across sidewalks
or other pedestrian facilities).
      (4)   Dimensions are in feet.
   (GG)   Queuing for drive-through facilities. In addition to meeting the
parking requirements of this section, businesses utilizing drive through
windows or those that offer drive through facilities shall provide sufficient
stacking space for five vehicles. For the purposes of this section, one
stacking space shall be construed as a minimum of nine feet in width and 19
feet in length. Such stacking space shall begin at the point of business
transaction and shall accommodate five vehicles without obstruction to through
vehicular traffic or parked vehicle areas. The point of business transaction
shall include teller windows, fast food order, location, a gasoline fuel pump,
car way bay, or the drive through automated teller window.
      (1)   Minimum dimensions. Each queue space shall be at least ten feet in
width and 20 feet in length.
      (2)   Design. Each queue lane shall be clearly defined and designated so
as not to conflict or interfere with other pedestrian or vehicular traffic on
the site.
   (HH)   Parking in residential areas. The following regulations shall apply
to outdoor parking for all residential zoning districts.
      (1)   Parking of passenger vehicles and light trucks. Passenger vehicles
and light trucks may be parked in any allowed parking area to the extent that
the number of vehicles being parked does not exceed the maximum permitted in
Table 157.046.1.
      (2)   Parking of heavy trucks. The parking of heavy trucks and equipment
is prohibited.
      (3)   Vehicle service and repair. Service and repair of vehicles not
owned or leased by and registered to a resident of the site is prohibited.
Vehicles may be serviced and repaired provided that the conditions listed in
either (a) and (b) or (c) and (d), below, are met.
         (a)   The vehicles are owned or leased by and registered to residents
of the site; and
         (b)   The service and repair is minor. Minor service and repair
includes tune-ups, replacement and servicing of oil and other fluids, and
replacement and adjustment of minor parts such as tires, hoses, belts, filters,
fuses and similar items. It does not include: body and fender repair and
replacement; painting; engine or transmission removal or replacement; or any
work using welders, torches, or air-driven power tools.
         (c)   The vehicles are owned or leased by and registered to residents
of the site; and
         (d)   All work occurs within a completely enclosed structure.
   (II)   Parking waiver provisions.
      (1)   General parking waivers. In extraordinary cases in which the
requirements of this section would create hardship in the use of a particular
site, the Planning Commission may consider granting a general parking waiver
during the design and planning phase of a major development. All other parking
waivers must be approved by the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   When required, general parking waivers are required when an
applicant wishes to provide less parking spaces than are required by this
section, when an applicant wishes to provide more parking spaces than are
allowed by this section.

areas which, except as otherwise specified herein, shall be processed,
implemented and enforced as prescribed by other portions of the Land
Development Code. The applicant shall pay the fee specified for such a request
unless the request is processed with a request for rezoning relating to the
same property.
         (c)   The names and addresses of:
            1.   Property owners;
            2.   Neighborhood association;
            3.   Any property owner within 100 feet of any joint parking lot or

Figure 157.047.4 Sign Area- Computation Methodology
   (C)   General provisions.
      (1)   Conformance to codes. Any sign hereafter erected shall conform to
the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of the International Building
Code and of any other ordinance or regulation within this jurisdiction.
      (2)   Signs in rights-of-way. Signs other than an official traffic sign
or similar sign shall not be erected within two feet (610 mm) of the lines of
any street, or within any public way, unless specifically authorized by other
ordinances or regulations of this jurisdiction or by specific authorization of
the Code Official.
      (3)   Projections over public ways. Signs projecting over public walkways
shall be permitted to do so only subject to the projection and clearance limits
either defined herein or, if not so defined, at a minimum height of eight feet
(2,438 mm) from grade level to the bottom of the sign. Signs, architectural
projections, or sign structures projecting over vehicular access areas must
conform to the minimum height clearance limitations imposed by the jurisdiction
for such structures.
      (4)   Traffic visibility. Signs or sign structures shall not be erected
at the intersection of any street in such a manner as to obstruct free and
clear vision, nor at any location where by its position, shape, or color it may
interfere with or obstruct the view of or be confused with any authorized
traffic sign, signal, or device.
      (5)   Computation of frontage. If a premises contains walls facing more
than one property line or encompasses property frontage bounded by more than
one street or other property usages, the sign area(s) for each building wall or
property frontage will be computed separately for each building wall or
property line facing a different frontage. The sign area(s) thus calculated
shall be permitted to then be applied to permitted signs placed on each
separate wall or property line frontage.
      (6)   Animation and changeable messages. Animated signs, except as
prohibited in division (E) below are permitted in commercial and industrial
zones only. Changeable signs, manually activated, are permitted for non-
residential uses in all zones. Changeable signs, electrically activated, are
permitted in all non- residential zones.
      (7)   Maintenance, repair, and removal. Every sign permitted by this
chapter shall be kept in good condition and repair. Where any sign becomes
insecure, in danger of falling or is otherwise deemed unsafe by the Code
Official, or if any sign shall be unlawfully installed, erected or maintained
in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, the owner thereof or the
person or firm using same shall, upon written notice by the Code Official
forthwith in the case of immediate danger, and in any case within not more than
ten days, make such sign conform to the provisions of this chapter, or shall
remove it. If within ten days the order is not complied with, the Code Official
shall be permitted to remove or cause such sign to be removed at the expense of
the owner and/or the user of the sign.
      (8)   Obsolete sign copy. Any sign copy that no longer advertises or
identifies a use conducted on the property on which said sign is erected must
have the sign copy covered or removed within 30 days after written notification
from the Code Official; and upon failure to comply with such notice, the Code
Official is hereby authorized to cause removal of such sign copy, and any
expense incident thereto shall be paid by the owner of the building, structure
or ground on which the sign is located.
      (9)   Non-conforming signs. Any sign legally existing at the time of the
passage of this chapter that does not conform in use, location, height, or size
with the regulations of the zone in which such sign is located, shall be
considered to be a legal non- conforming use or structure, and shall be
permitted to continue in such status until such time as it is either abandoned
or removed by its owner, subject to the following limitations:
         (a)   Structural alterations, enlargement or re-erection are
permissible only where such alterations will not increase the degree of non-
conformity of the signs.
         (b)   Any legal non-conforming sign shall be removed or rebuilt
without increasing the existing height or area if it is damaged, or removed if
allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the cost of repair or restoration
exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of the sign as determined by the Code
Official.
         (c)   Signs that comply with either (C)(9)(a) or (b) need not be
permitted.
   (D)   Exempt signs. The following signs shall be exempt from the provisions

   (E)   Prohibited signs. The following devices and locations shall be
specifically prohibited:
      (1)   With the exception of lawfully existing billboard signs, and those
properly-permitted pursuant to the provisions of division (F)(5) below, and
except as is otherwise specifically set forth in this chapter, off premises
business or commercial signs are prohibited. A sign shall be deemed to be a
business or commercial sign if it advertises a business, commercial
establishment, product, or service.
      (2)   Signs located in such a manner as to obstruct or otherwise
interfere with an official traffic sign, signal, or device, or obstruct or
interfere with a driver's view of approaching, merging, or intersecting
traffic.
      (3)   Except as provided for elsewhere in this code, signs encroaching on
or overhanging public right-of-way. Signs shall not be attached to any utility
pole, light standard, street tree or any other public facility located within

that would cause such signs to have the appearance of traffic safety signs and
lights, or municipal vehicle warnings from a distance.
      (5)   Portable signs except as allowed for temporary signs.
      (6)   Any sign attached to, or placed on, a vehicle or trailer parked on
public or private property, except for signs meeting the following conditions:

display of signs.
         (b)   The signs are magnetic, decals or painted on an integral part of
the vehicle or equipment as originally designed by the manufacturer, and do not
break the silhouette of the vehicle.
         (c)   The vehicle or trailer is in operating condition, currently
registered and licensed to operate on public streets where applicable, and
actively used or available for use in the daily function of the business to
which such signs relate.

distribution points for commercial products or services for the general public.
      (8)   Balloons, streamers, or pinwheels except those temporarily
displayed as part of a special sale, promotion, or community event. For the
purposes of this division, "temporarily" means not more than 20 days in any
calendar year.
      (9)   Illuminated signs are prohibited in residential zoning districts.
   (F)   Permits.
      (1)   Permits required. Unless specifically exempted, a permit must be
obtained from the Code Official for the erection and maintenance of all signs
erected or maintained within this jurisdiction and in accordance with other
ordinances of this jurisdiction. Exemptions from the necessity of securing a
permit, however, shall not be construed to relieve the owner of the sign
involved from responsibility for its erection and maintenance in a safe manner
and in a manner in accordance with all the other provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Construction documents. Before any permit is granted for the
erection of a sign or sign structure requiring such permit, construction
documents shall be filed with the Code Official showing the dimensions,
materials and required details of construction, including loads, stresses,
anchorage, and any other pertinent data. The permit application shall be
accompanied by the written consent of the owner or lessee of the premises on
which the sign is to be erected and by engineering calculations signed and
sealed by a registered design professional where required by the International
Building Code.
      (3)   Changes to signs. Signs shall not be structurally altered,
enlarged, or relocated except in conformity to the provisions herein, nor until
a proper permit, if required, has been secured. The changing or maintenance of
movable parts or components of an approved sign that is designed for such
changes, or the changing of copy, business names, lettering, sign faces,
colors, display and/or graphic matter, or the content of any sign shall not be
deemed a structural alteration.
      (4)   Permit fees. Permit fees to erect, alter or relocate a sign shall
be in accordance with the fee schedule adopted within this jurisdiction.
      (5)   Electronic billboards.
         (a)   Outdoor advertising signs, consisting of digital billboards, are
permitted in the B-3, B-4 (Highway Commercial), I-1, and 1-2 (Industrial) zones
but only upon approval by the Board of Adjustments as to location and subject
to such conditions as the Board may deem appropriate as to such location. No
digital billboard shall be constructed, placed, or erected within 1,000 feet of
any existing digital billboard. The Board of Adjustments shall require a light
study to be submitted with any application for a digital billboard.
         (b)   An applicant for a digital billboard must demonstrate their
ability and willingness to remove and abandon one existing static billboard
(off-premises sign) within the city upon issuance of the permit for the
requested digital billboard. Upon approval of the application by the Board of
Adjustments and approval by the city of the necessary structural plans for the
digital billboard (see division (F)(2) above), the city shall issue any
necessary permits for installation and operation of the digital billboard.
         (c)   If applicable, a copy of any required state permit shall be
submitted to the Codes Enforcement Department after issuance of the city
permit, but prior to commencement of construction of the billboard.

§ 157.049 OUTDOOR LIGHTING.
   The following regulations shall apply to any outdoor lighting located within
the city only, in any district where there are parking spaces for five or more
vehicles, or where a building, sign, or electrical permit is required for the
installation of lighting fixtures.
   (A)   Submission of light plan. Any building, structure or use of land that
requires a review and approval of a parking plan, as specified in this chapter,
shall provide a lighting plan. A lighting plan may also be required at the
determination of the Chief Enforcement Officer, when a building, sign, or
electrical permit application for lighting fixtures is filed. The lighting plan
shall provide the following information as a minimum:
      (1)   A photometric plan showing the proposed intensity levels of the
lighting throughout the site, indicating foot-candle measurement shall be
provided. The lighting plan shall include the property lines and right-of-way
lines for the site, and shall include the first 50 feet of adjacent property,
at a minimum. Light levels shall be indicated a minimum of 30 feet onto
adjacent properties. The lighting plan shall indicate all site lighting
including on-building security, flood, and other lights in the evaluation. The
initial output of lamp fixtures, as defined by the manufacturer, is the value
to be considered in the intensity analysis.
      (2)   The lighting plan shall indicate the locations of each of the
proposed fixtures.
      (3)   The lighting plan shall indicate the minimum, maximum, and average
intensity/illumination for the site.
      (4)   Details of all proposed outdoor lighting fixtures shall be
provided, indicating manufacturer, model and style of the fixture. A graphic
representation of the fixture is requested. The fixture lamp type (i.e. low
pressure sodium, metal halide, etc.) shall be indicated on the proposed plans.
      (5)   The proposed height of the lighting fixtures shall be indicated.
      (6)   The hours of use of the lighting fixtures shall be indicated on the
plans.
   (B)   Height. All outdoor lighting shall be designed, located, and mounted
at heights no greater than 12 feet above grade for non-cutoff-lights and 22
feet above grade for cutoff lights. A greater height may be authorized in any
district by a variance approved as required in §
157.039. Lighting height should not exceed the permitted building height. The
following guidelines are provided based on the intensity of the proposed use.
 
HEIGHT RANGE BY ACTIVITY LEVEL
Low    10 feet to 15 feet
Medium 10 feet to 18 feet
High   10 feet to 22 feet
 
 
AVERAGE ILLUMINATION BY ACTIVITY LEVEL
Examples of Activity Levels for Open Parking
Low    Multi-family dwellings, education facilities, churches, local commercial
       and industrial use.
Medium Community and neighborhood shopping centers, office parks, hospitals,
       commuter lots, community facilities (cultural, civic, recreational).
High   Regional shopping centers, motorist services at expressway interchanges,
       athletic facilities, and regional cultural or civic facilities.
 
   (C)   Illumination.
      (1)   Outdoor lighting shall be designed and located with a maximum
illumination of 0.5 footcandles at the property line. Lighting for parking
areas and where security lighting is needed shall have a minimum of 0.5
footcandles. The guidelines for illumination levels listed below are based on
the activity levels described above.
 
AVERAGE ILLUMINATION BY ACTIVITY LEVEL
Low    1 footcandles
Medium 2 footcandles
High   3 footcandles
 
      (2)   Uniformity of illumination (maximum/minimum footcandle ratio)
should not exceed 15.1.
      (3)   Illumination of access drive should not exceed average footcandles
maintained at adjacent public record.
   (D)   Light trespass. Light trespass is any form of artificial illumination
emanating from a light fixture (or illuminated sign) that penetrates other
property and creates a nuisance. A lighting plan shall be provided by the
property owner proposing the installation of outdoor lighting fixtures and
shall meet the following minimum standards for light trespass:
      (1)   Outdoor light fixtures shall be directed so that there will not be
any objectionable direct glare source visible from any property, and shall be
properly installed and thereafter maintained.
      (2)   At a height of five feet above the property line of the subject
property, illumination from light fixtures shall not exceed 0.5 footcandles in
a vertical plane on adjacent property.
      (3)   Appropriate fixture lamp types and shielding shall be installed to
prevent light trespass onto adjacent property.
   (E)   Shielding. All outdoor lighting for non-residential uses shall be
located, screened, or shielded so adjacent lots located in residential
districts are not directly illuminated. Shielding may also be required for high
intensity light fixtures to prevent glare to adjacent uses, public right-of-
ways, and drivers. Perimeter lighting should be cut-off fixtures to prevent
light trespass onto adjacent properties.
   (F)   Color and glare. No outdoor lighting shall be of such intensity or
color distortion as to cause glare or to impair the vision of drivers,
pedestrians, or adjacent properties. Shields and/or filters are required for
light fixtures with high intensity and glare potential. All lighting shall be
provided by cut-off fixtures with no extended/projected lenses
   (G)   Factors for evaluation. The following factors shall be considered in
the evaluation of lighting plans:
      (1)   Pole height;
      (2)   Type of luminaries;
      (3)   Site coverage-average maintained;
      (4)   Uniformity: (1) maximum: minimum, (2) average: minimum; and
      (5)   Intensity at property line.
   (H)   Location. Outdoor lighting need not comply with the yard requirements
of each district, except that no such light shall obstruct vision in the sight
triangles as specified elsewhere in this chapter.
   (I)   Exemptions.
      (1)   All outdoor lighting fixtures producing light directly by the
combination of fossil fuels, such as kerosene lanterns of gas lamps, are exempt
from the requirements of this section.
      (2)   Holiday lighting shall be exempt from the requirements of this
section.
      (3)   All temporary emergency lighting needed by police or fire
departments or other emergency services, as well as all vehicular luminaries,
shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.
   (J)   Special approval. Search lights, laser source lights, or any similar
high-intensity light shall not be permitted, except in emergencies by police
and fire department personnel at their discretion, unless a temporary sign/use
permit is issued by the Chief Enforcement Officer.
   (K)   Modifications. Should any outdoor light fixture or the type of light
source therein be changed after the permit has been issued, a change request
must be submitted to the Chief Enforcement Officer for his approval, together
with adequate information to assure compliance with this section, which must be
received prior to substitution.
   (L)   Local street lighting. These regulations are designed to ensure the
proper installation and maintenance of all local street lights, promoting
safety and uniformity in our city's streets.
      (1)   Intersections. To provide lighting within the intersection area of
two local streets, a light pole will be installed on one corner of an
intersection or opposite the intersection in the case of a T-intersection.
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs. A light pole will be installed within the cul-de-sac
when the cul-de-sac street is longer than 200 feet measured from the
intersection of the intersecting streets to the center of the cul-de-sac.
      (3)   Mid-block streetlights. A minimum number of mid-block streetlights
will be installed to achieve a desired pole spacing of approximately 250 feet.
The maximum spacing between lights should not exceed 300 feet, and the minimum
spacing between lights should not be less than 200 feet unless otherwise
approved by the City Planning and Zoning Department. Lights should be on or
near a property line and not in front of residences, if avoidable. Lighting on
local streets is installed and maintained by the electrical utility company.
For all new developments, the developer shall indicate the location of
streetlights on the construction plans for all local streets. The Planning and
Zoning Department will review the location of streetlights and authorize the
electrical utility company to install the streetlights.
      (4)   Continuous lighting design. These criteria are established to
provide uniform procedures to aid the design engineer in preparing improvement
plans. They are not to be rigid rules that would restrict the design engineer
from utilizing creative or original design; however, these criteria may be
modified only with prior authorization by the Planning and Zoning Department.
      (5)   Placement of street light poles. The actual spacing of street light
poles should be the possible spacing nearest to the calculated theoretical
spacing. At locations where additional lighting may be beneficial, such as
around curves, at intersections, and crosswalks, pole spacing may be reduced to
increase lighting levels. Street light poles shall have a minimum setback of
three feet, measured from the back of the curb to the center of the pole
foundation. The minimum setback for a non-curbed street shall be six feet,
measured from the edge of the pavement to the center of the pole foundation.
Poles may be located in medians where the minimum setback requirements can be
satisfied. In medians, poles shall be installed as close as possible to the
center of the median. All poles in medians shall be a minimum of 15 feet behind
the median nose. Poles located at the intersection of residential streets
should desirably be placed so the light pole can be used to mount stop and
street name signs. That means the pole should be installed as near to the
location where a vehicle should stop while maintaining the minimum setback of
three feet from the back of the curb. All poles installed in residential areas
should ideally be located on or near property lines whenever possible. In the
case of larger lots, poles cannot always be located on the property line. In
these cases, in order not to exceed the maximum desired pole spacing, poles can
be located within the lot. The designer should take care not to locate the pole
in front of houses. Any pole near a residential drive entrance should be a
minimum of five feet from the edge of the drive apron. The design engineer
should also coordinate the location of all poles with existing trees, such that
the fixture does not extend into the tree canopy or such that the tree canopy
does not block the light output from the fixture.

THE DIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF LAND
§ 157.060 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to regulate the subdivision and subsequent
physical development of the land within the city limits to ensure that lots,
streets, sidewalks, public utilities, drainage facilities, and other related
items are completed in such a way as to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the public. The Access Management and Roadway Manual shall be used
to provide specific documentation for the location of streets, driveway access
points and construction of roadway and related facilities. Each set of plans
for the development of land in the city shall have a compliance statement
included as part of the submission of documents for review of the plans. A copy
of the compliance statement can be found in Appendix D of the Access Management
and Roadway Manual. These regulations spell out the procedure for submission,
review, and recording of plats, the specification for format and contents of
all subdivision plats, requirements for design of and specifications for lot
layout, physical improvements of street, utilities, and other facilities, and
the extent to which they shall be installed or dedicated as conditions
precedent to approval of any plat. In addition, provisions for good and
sufficient surety to ensure proper completion of physical improvements, and
specifications for the extent to which land is to be used for public purposes
are included.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.061 AUTHORITY.
   The legal authority for the subdivision and development of land is based
upon KRS 100.277 as follows:
   (A)   No person or his agent shall subdivide any land before securing the
Planning Commission's approval of a plat designating the areas to be
subdivided, and no plat of a subdivision of land within the planning unit's
jurisdiction shall be recorded by the County Clerk until the plat has been
approved by the Planning Commission and the approval entered thereon in writing
by the Chairman or other authorized officer of the Planning Commission.
   (B)   No person owning land comprising a subdivision, or his agent, shall
transfer, sell, or agree to sell any lot or parcel of land located within a
subdivision by reference to, or by exhibition, or by any other use of a plat of
such subdivision, before such plat has received final approval by the Planning
Commission, and has been recorded. Any such instrument of transfer, sale, or
contact shall be void and shall not be subject to be recorded, but all rights
of such purchaser to damages are hereby preserved. The description of such a
lot or parcel by metes and bounds in any contract or instrument of transfer or
other document used in the process of selling or transferring same shall not
exempt the person attempting to transfer from penalties provided, or deprive
the purchaser of any right or remedies he may otherwise have.
   (C)   When a tract of land is being divided and the property owner declares
that the intended use is for agriculture, the Planning Commission shall review
all survey plats of deeds submitted for must give testimony and provide a
written notarized affidavit stating that the primary use of the land is for
agricultural use and not for residential building development for sale or lease
to the public (see definition of “agricultural use”). Additionally, the
Planning Commission may require that a statement be placed on the plat to the
effect that the land is not to be used for residential building development for
sale or lease to the general public. If the intended use of the land for
agricultural purposes is obvious from the initial plat review, the Planning
Commission may designate the Planning and Zoning Director authority to sign off
on the plat.

Committee in the review process. The TAC shall review all plats for compliance
with the technical provisions of the regulations prior to submission of the
plat to the Planning Commission. The TAC shall meet monthly prior to the
regular meeting of the Planning Commission.
      (3)   The following chart briefly outlines the procedures and types of
subdivision reviews.

   (E)   Advisory meeting with the Planning Commission. Prior to the
preparation of any subdivision plan or plat, a subdivider or applicant is
encouraged to meet with the Planning Commission's Planning and Zoning Director
and staff in order to expedite the processing or review of each subdivision
plan or plat. This meeting is intended to familiarize the subdivider with the
current regulations and to ascertain the location of any planned development
projects and infrastructure, which may affect the property being considered for
subdivision. This step does not require a formal application or the filing of a
plat with the Planning Commission, but does require the subdivider to submit
the following information:
      (1)   Name of the subdivision, date, direction, and scale.
      (2)   Name and addresses of property owner(s).
      (3)   A sketch plat of the property showing shape, approximate
dimensions, and total acreage.
      (4)   A vicinity map showing the general location of the property,
existing roads, surrounding property, and major physical features.
      (5)   Generalized layout of proposed streets and lots.
      (6)   Available and proposed utilities.
      (7)   Relationship to services, including schools, parks, etc.
      (8)   Intended use for all parcels of land.
   (F)   Minor subdivisions.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Director shall determine whether the
proposed subdivision constitutes a minor or major subdivision. To qualify as a
minor plat, a subdivision must meet one of the following requirements:
         (a)   The subdivision contains no more than three contiguous lots
(counting the remainder of the parent tract). If more than three lots are
involved then said lots shall be handled as a re-subdivision and processed as a
preliminary and final plat.
         (b)   The parcel to be subdivided will not involve the construction of
any public water lines, storm or sanitary sewers, and streets, which require
the review and processing through preliminary and final plats.
         (c)   The subdivision provides for the transfer of land between
adjacent property owners and does not involve the creation of any new lots or
building sites.
         (d)   The subdivision includes three lots of record that are being
consolidated to create a lesser number of parcels and involves no new public
improvements.
      (2)   Any plat that does not meet the above criteria shall be considered
a major plat. Subdivision plats that are submitted for multi-family
residential, commercial, and industrial development shall be considered as
major plats and are subject to the preliminary and final plat review process,
and submission of development plans.
   (G)   Minor plat submission. The subdivider shall submit an application for
minor plat approval to the Planning and Zoning Director with 15 signed copies
and two digital copies (either .dwg or .dgn format) of the minor plat prepared
in accordance with all applicable requirements of this chapter. This
application shall be filed in the Planning and Zoning Department according to
the schedule provided by that department. For a list of information items to be
provided in a minor plat, see plat requirements in §
157.063. The Planning and Zoning Director shall review the minor plat to ensure
that it meets all the applicable requirements, and shall take one of the
following actions; 1) approve the minor plat; or 2) disapprove the minor plat.
If the minor plat is disapproved, written notice of such action, including the
reasons for disapproval shall be mailed to the applicant and notification given
to the Chairman of the Planning Commission. If the minor plat is approved, the
Chairman of the Planning Commission shall sign a copy of the original minor
plat, which shall be forwarded directly to the County Clerk's Office for
recording.
   (H)   Major subdivisions. Any subdivision not meeting the requirements of
division (F) shall be considered as a major plat and subject to a two step
review process; 1) review of the preliminary plat, and 2) review of the final
plat.
   (I)   The preliminary plat. The purpose of the preliminary plat is to
provide a graphic statement of the proposed development of a tract of land. The
preliminary plat is "preliminary" in the sense that the Planning Commission may
make recommendations for improving the design or improvement standards before
they become finalized on the land. Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the
Planning Commission, the developer is authorized to proceed with the
construction plan process. If the proposed subdivision is to be constructed in
more than one phase, the developer shall show the entire proposed development
on the preliminary plat. Phases shall occur in such a way as to minimize the
cost of extending utilities.
   (J)   Submission. The developer shall apply for approval of a plat/plan on
the application form provided by the Department of Planning and Zoning
according to the schedule provided by the department. The completed application
shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Director along with the plat/plan
and the plat requirements checklist in accordance with the requirements of
Appendix A. The Planning and Zoning Director may refuse to accept the proposed
subdivision application if it is determined to be incomplete. The plat/plan
shall be prepared by a registered engineer or surveyor (as applicable) at a
scale not greater than one inch = 100 feet, and shall be on one or more sheets
24 x 36 inches in size and include two digital copies. When plats/plans are
being submitted for any plat/plan, GPS monumentation on state plane coordinate
for that plat/plan shall be established and submitted digitally with that plat/
plan.
   (K)   Number of copies. The developer shall submit 15 copies of the plat/
plans, three copies of the best management plan and calculations, and two
digital copies with required supplementary information to the Planning and
Zoning Director for distribution to the Technical Advisory Committee and the
Planning Commission for review and recommendations.
   (L)   Plat review.
      (1)   The TAC shall conduct technical review of the plat and submit
written comments to the Planning Commission no later than ten working days
prior to the Planning Commission work session. These comments will focus on any
concerns or conditions that need to be addressed regarding the plat. The City
Utilities Board's procedure for review of water, sanitary sewage, and gas is
specified in their Infrastructure Development Manuals.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall review the report of the TAC and
shall receive additional information at its regular work session. The developer
or an authorized representative shall be present at the meeting to answer
questions or provide additional information. The intent of the work session is
to generate discussion and provide pertinent information needed by the Planning
Commission in their decision-making process. Conditions not yet met will be
recorded in the minutes of the work session. Conditions shall be met before the
plat will be voted on in the business session. If signatures have not been
completed due to extenuating circumstances, the Planning Commission may approve
the plat pending signatures.
      (3)   Final consideration of the proposed preliminary plat will normally
be made during a Planning Commission business meeting (regular or special
called). In determining whether a preliminary plat shall be approved, the
Planning Commission shall consider the following:
         (a)   Conformance with plat requirements.
         (b)   Adequate allocation of areas for streets, parks, schools, public
and semi-public buildings, homes, utilities, businesses and industries.
         (c)   Distribution of population and traffic in a manner so as to
create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience, and the harmonious
development of the community.
         (d)   Comments from other agencies and officials. Notice shall be
given to other local governments if the subdivision includes a street extending
into their jurisdiction.
         (e)   Comments made by the public at the Planning Commission meeting.
      (4)   No preliminary plat shall be approved until an access permit has
been obtained from the State Highway Department (if applicable).
   (M)   Planning Commission action. Within 60 days of the Planning Commission
business meeting on the preliminary plat, the Commission shall make one of the
following decisions; 1) approve the plat, 2) approve the plat pending
signatures, 3) disapprove the plat, unless such time is extended by agreement
of the Planning Commission and the developer, or 4) postpone taking action for
specific stated reasons up to 30 days. If the Planning Commission finds that
the preliminary plat does not meet the requirements of the regulations, it
shall either disapprove the plat or approve the plat, subject to signatures
being completed within the same time period. Failure of the Planning Commission
to act within the specified time shall be considered as approval of the plat.
Approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission does not constitute
final approval of the subdivision, but is merely an authorization to proceed
with the preparation of the final plat and construction of public facilities.
In the event of a disapproval or conditional approval of the preliminary plat,
a statement in writing by the Planning Commission setting forth the reasons for
disapproval or the conditions for approval, shall be entered into the records
of the Planning Commission.
   (N)   Effective period of approval. At such times as a preliminary plat has
been approved by the Planning Commission, one copy shall be returned to the
developer for compliance with final approval requirements. Such approval shall
be effective for one year from the date of approval. The approval date for each
plat is the date of the planning and zoning business meeting at which the plat
is approved with or without conditions. During that time, the general terms and
conditions under which the preliminary plat was granted will not be affected by
any changes to these regulations. An extension of six months may be granted
provided the developer submits a written request to the Planning Commission and
it is approved.
   (O)   Adjustment of preliminary plat requirements. The Planning Commission
may waive the requirements in any individual case where in the Commission's
judgment such a waiver would be in the public interest and would eliminate
undue hardship. No waiver shall be granted which will have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of the regulations. In granting any waiver,
the Commission shall attach such conditions as are necessary in its judgment to
secure substantially the objectives of the requirements being adjusted. Any
waiver of these requirements shall be requested specifically in writing by the
developer with reference to the particular section to be waived. This request
shall be accompanied by the submission of the preliminary plat and be entered
in the minutes of the review meeting at least 30 days prior to the plat
elapsing.
   (P)   Amending the preliminary plat. If the developer desires to make a
substantial change in a preliminary plat that has been approved by the Planning
Commission (such as a sufficient change in the number of lots, major
realignment of street, changes to the stormwater infrastructure, or use of
previously dedicated property), an amended preliminary plat must be filed in
accordance with procedures previously described. The updated amendments must
also meet the current regulations.
   (Q)   Construction plans.
      (1)   All final plats, which contain a lot or lots requiring instillation
of improvements shall have 15 copies of construction plans submitted to the
Planning and Zoning office for approval ten days prior by 12:00p.m. to the
Technical Advisory Committee meeting. Upon review and approval of the
construction plans per method and procedure adopted by the Planning Commission,
one set shall signed approved by the Planning and Zoning Director/Planning and
Zoning Engineer and returned to the applicant. Said construction plans shall be
submitted and approval at minimum 30 days prior to approval of the final plat.
      (2)   The applicant shall not proceed with any construction of subject
improvements, which include roadways, storm sewer, or any other improvements in
which the city will ultimately be taking ownership of until such time as he or
she is in receipt of approved construction plans. Construction of such
improvements shall comply with approved construction plans. The Planning
Commission shall approve any deviation from approved plans of construction.
      (3)   Based upon the Planning Commission's approval of plans, the
Planning Commission shall not be liable for any error or omission of the design
and/or construction. A City Planning and Zoning employee shall inspect all
construction at various phases throughout the construction. In addition to the
City Inspector the applicant/developer shall have his engineer submit the
city's storm sewer infrastructure construction and functionality inspection
form upon completion of the site and before a final plat shall be approved.
      (4)   If, prior to inspection, any phase of construction is obscured by a
subsequent phase of construction, the City Inspector shall order the applicant/
developer to cease development. Test to determine conformance to the
construction standards of the development ordinance shall be performed by a
qualified registered engineer at the expense of the applicant/developer. If the
tests are not satisfactory the said Inspector may require the removal of any
material necessary to correct the construction deficiency. The construction
plans shall consist of but not be limited to: a proposed grading plan,
stormwater plans (drainage calculations, layout of all storm lines, detention
design and outlet structure design). Roadway design (plan, profile and critical
cross sections), layout of all sanitary sewer and water lines and any permits
that may be required on the project. All water and sanitary sewer plans will
continue to be submitted to Richmond Utilities for their approval.
   (R)   Final plat.
      (1)   The final plat serves as a plat of record for public recording and
transfer of land, and as a check to assure that subdivision requirements
(including any conditions stipulated in the preliminary plat) have been met.
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat and
construction plans as approved, and it may constitute only a portion of the
preliminary plat, which the developer proposes to develop and record. No final
plat shall be approved until at least 30 days following the approval of the
construction plans. The Planning Commission at the business meeting will review
no final plat until either all improvements on the preliminary plat/
construction plans have been made or all unfinished items have been guaranteed
by a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit.
      (2)   Final plats cannot be submitted for approval less than 30 days
after the preliminary plat and construction plans have been completed and
approved with a signed and stamped copy on file with the city’s Planning and
Zoning office.
   (S)   Submittal.
      (1)   Within one year of approval of the preliminary plat, the developer
shall file the final subdivision plat for review and action by the Planning
Commission. Failure to submit the final plat within a year's time shall require
re-approval of the expired preliminary plat. An extension of six months may be
granted provided the developer submits a written request to the Planning
Commission and it is approved.
      (2)   The developer shall submit an application for final plat approval
along with the plat requirements checklist to the Planning and Zoning Director.
At the time of filing, a non-returnable filing fee shall be paid according to
the fee schedule. The final plat shall be prepared and sealed by a registered
engineer or surveyor (as applicable), at a scale not greater than one inch =
100 ft. on one or more sheets 24 x 36 inches in size. All final plats are to be
submitted in digital format for G.I.S. mapping purposes only, as provided for
in the city's digital submission requirements. The developer shall submit a CAD
drawing that is geo-referenced and to real world scale. Submission shall be in
a .dwg or .dgn format.
   (T)   Number of copies. 15 copies of the final plat along with two digital
copies, together with any street profiles or other required plans shall be
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Director.
   (U)   Plat review. The Technical Advisory Committee shall review the final
plat as to computations, certifications, monuments, and related items to ensure
that all required improvements have been completed to the satisfaction of city
engineering standards. The TAC shall submit a written report to the Planning
Commission for their consideration in reviewing the plat. In case a security
bond or certified check has been posted, the developer's engineer will provide
a detailed breakdown of the individual project development costs as well as the
percentage of work completed on each improvement. The developer's engineer will
verify that the amount of the surety is sufficient to cover the cost of
required improvements yet to be completed.
   (V)   Planning Commission action. Within 35 days after the review of the
final plat, the Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the plat.
Failure of the Planning Commission to act upon the final plat within 35 days
shall be deemed approval of the plat. If the plat is disapproved, the grounds
of the disapproval shall be stated in the records of the Planning Commission
and the developer will be notified of the reasons for disapproval. Approval by
the Planning Commission shall not constitute acceptance by the public of the
dedication of any streets, other public way, or ground. When streets have been
constructed, inspected, and approved, the dedicated street or public way shall
be accepted for maintenance by the city within 45 days and shall be a public
way for all purposes.

   See
Appendix A for the checklist for plat/plan requirements.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.064 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Chapter 100 of KRS enables the Planning Commission to establish
standards for local development as well as to establish the procedures
necessary for implementing these standards. The statutes also include specific
provisions for the enforcement of these regulations and penalties for the
violation thereof as set forth in §
157.999.
   (B)   The city shall have a cause of action for all appropriates relief,
including injunctions against any governmental bodies or any aggrieved person
who violates this chapter or regulations adopted hereunder (KRS 100.337).
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.065 PLATS OF RECORD.
   (A)   Much of the authority for regulating land subdivisions comes from the
necessity for recording parcels of land within the County Clerk's Office as a
condition for transfer of ownership.
   (B)   All final/minor plats approved by the Planning Commission shall be
recorded at the expense of the applicant in the office of the County Court
Clerk. Following approval of the final/minor plat the Planning and Zoning
Director shall return one copy of the plat to the developer with Planning
Commission certification thereon for filing with the Clerk as an official plat
of record. The plat being recorded shall be no more than 24 x 36 inches in
size. A final/minor plat shall be recorded within one year of approval by the
Planning Commission or else the approval automatically expires. The developer
may request an extension of six months by submitting a written request to the
Planning Commission prior to the plat's expiration (KRS 100.344).
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.066 LAND SOLD IN VIOLATION OF STATE STATUTE.
   When it has been discovered that land has been sold or transferred, or that
a contract has been entered into for the sale or transfer of land in violation
of the provisions of this chapter pertaining to the regulation of subdivisions,
the owner or owners of record shall file plats of the land in accordance with
this chapter. When land is transferred or sold, or a contact has been entered
into for sale or transfer of land in violation of this chapter, the land shall
be governed by the subdivision regulations both prior to and after the platting
of the land by the owner of record, as if a plat had been filed in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter pertaining to subdivision regulations.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
Statutory reference:
   Further provisions, see KRS 100.377
§ 157.067 APPEALS.
   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by final action of
the Planning Commission shall appeal from the final action to the Madison
County Circuit Court. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days after such
action. Such action shall not include the Planning Commission's recommendations
made other governmental bodies. All final actions, which have not been appealed
within 30 days, shall not be subject to judicial review.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.068 DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Minimum standards. The standards set forth in this section are
authorized under KRS 100.281 and are considered to be minimum acceptable
standards of design for safe, efficient, and economical development within the
city. Where the Planning Commission determines that excess capacity facilities
are needed, as defined in the respective sections, the city shall be
responsible for arrangements to cover the cost of that capacity required beyond
what is needed to serve the immediate development.
   (B)   Developer's responsibility. Generally, the developer shall be
responsible for providing the land and constructing those public improvements
required to serve his development. It is also the responsibility of the
developer to notify the proper governmental agency when improvements are
underway so that work can be inspected to ensure compliance with this chapter.
Additionally, the developer is required to notify the appropriate governmental
agency when work is completed so that a final inspection can be conducted.
   (C)   Site conditions.
      (1)   (a)   Land suitability. If the Planning Commission finds that the
land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to
flooding, poor drainage, topography, or other such conditions that may endanger
life, health, or property, the Planning Commission shall not approve the land
for subdivision unless the developer proposes adequate methods for alleviating
these unsuitable conditions.
         (b)   In addition, the Planning Commission may refuse to approve what
it considers to be scattered or premature subdivision of land which would
involve danger or injury to the public health, safety; or
      (2)   Natural features. The street plan and lot layout of the proposed
subdivision shall be so designed as to preserve natural features such as trees,
streams, the natural lay of the land, and the disposition of topsoil.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.069 LOT DEVELOPMENT.
   The size, proportion, and orientation of individual parcels of land and the
buildings placed on them will vary with intended type of land use and with the
geologic characteristics of the land. Other principles of lot use and layout
are more generally applicable and are basic to principles of good subdivisions
design.
   (A)   Lot area and dimensions. §
157.041(C) specifies the minimum lot area and dimensional requirements for each
land use classification.
   (B)   Single building per lot. Each separate principal use building shall be
situated on a separate and single subdivided lot of record.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.070 LOT LAYOUT.
   (A)   Lot lines. All side lines of lots should be at right angles to
straight streets and radial to curved streets.
   (B)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall be laid out so as to provide at least
minimum front yard requirements along both street frontages. Access to corner
lots shall be as specified in the Access Management and Roadway Manual.
   (C)   Double frontage lots. Lots shall not be laid out so that they have
frontage on more than one street except for corner lots, or when the rear of
the lot faces an arterial, freeway, or railroad right-of-way and the front of
the lot faces on a minor street.
   (D)   Topography and site grading. All parcels or lots shall be laid out in
proper relationship to the topography and shall provide a building site of
adequate size that will minimize problems of drainage and soil erosion.
      (1)   Purpose. It is the intent of this section to recognize that steep
terrain, native vegetation, natural drainage courses, and other physical
features characterize certain areas of the city. The intent is also to
establish standards of development for these areas that help to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare by minimizing potential for erosion,
sedimentation, flooding, and landslides, while at the same time protecting and
enhancing the visual quality of the city's natural landscape. Specific
regulations and guidelines are necessary to address the following:
         (a)   Protection of the people and property from hazards and problems
associated with stormwater runoff, flooding, and erosion.
         (b)   Minimizing the threat and consequential damage of landslides in
hillside areas.
         (c)   Aesthetic enhancement of the community.
         (d)   Assisting with water quality and quantity issues throughout the
community.
      (2)   In order to complete the goals above, the city has compiled a set
of design standards that are listed below:
         (a)   The maximum slopes for any cut or fill shall be a maximum of 2:
1 (two feet of horizontal run for each foot of rise or fall), except:
            1.   Earthen dam embankments;
            2.   Rock cuts; or
            3.   Where certified by a professional geotechnical engineer and
supporting documentation.
         (b)   Earthen dam embankments shall be 3:1 maximum unless a
modification application is approved. The intent of the earthen dam embankment
slope regulation is to provide for public safety, soil stability, and dam
maintenance considerations.
         (c)   When certification is provided by a professional geotechnical
engineer it must be accompanied by a detailed plan for compacting of the fill/
cut the disturbed material, a stabilization plan, and schedule.
         (d)   Retaining walls may also be required whenever topographic
conditions warrant or where necessary or determined by the city reviewer. All
retaining walls shall be designed and submitted to the codes office by an
engineer licensed in structures and certified in the State of Kentucky.
         (e)   Any use of explosive/blasting materials for construction
purposes will require the following:
            1.   Blasting notification;
            2.   The blaster's name;
            3.   The blaster's license number; and
            4.   The required fees filed with the city’s Planning and Zoning
office before any blasting can occur.
   (E)   Land remnants. If remnants of land exist after subdividing and have no
apparent future use, which can be properly controlled, they shall be
incorporated into the lot pattern of the proposed subdivision.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.071 BUILDING SETBACK LINE.
   The building setback line for development of a parcel of land shall be in
accordance with the requirements of §
157.041(C).
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.072 LOT IDENTIFICATION.
   (A)   Monuments. Permanent monuments of concrete or steel rods shall be set
at all lot corners, angle points, and points of curves in streets and their
locations marked on the final plat.
   (B)   Lot numbers. All parcels of land in a subdivision, other than streets,
shall be given a consecutive lot number. This requirement applies to lots
intended for non-residential use.
   (C)   Property numbering system. The 911 Office shall give individual lots a
street address.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.073 TRANSPORTATION.
   Proposed streets shall be considered in their relationship to existing and
planned streets, to topography, connectivity with other streets, public
convenience and safety, and in relationship to proposed land uses to be served.
Where it is desirable, consideration shall be given to other modes of
transportation
   (A)   Streets.
      (1)   Streets, as ways for movement of vehicular traffic, served two
principles functions:
         (a)   The movement of people and goods; and
         (b)   Access to adjoining properties.
      (2)   Unfortunately, these two functions often conflict due to the fact
that the smooth flow of vehicular traffic is interrupted by the number of
access points allowed. To adequately provide for these two competing functions,
sound traffic engineering principles require using a street classification
system with several levels. Each classification serves the two functions in
varying degrees. See the Access Management and Roadway Manual for additional
documentation on streets.
   (B)   Street classification system. The Access Management and Roadway
Manual, Chapter 2, documents the street classification system and definitions
for the various types of streets.
   (C)   Conformance with plan. The arrangement, location, character, width,
grade, and construction of all streets shall conform to the transportation plan
element of the city's Comprehensive Plan and shall be considered in
relationship to existing and planned streets, topography, access to adjacent
land, and public safety and convenience.
   (D)   Street classification standards. Street classification standards,
including the width of right of way, minimum pavement widths and percent grade
for local, collector and arterial streets can be found in the Access Management
and Roadway Manual, Chapter 10.
   (E)   Responsibility for streets. The developer shall construct all
subdivision streets including all clearing, grading, laying of sub-base, base,
and pavement, curbs and gutters, culverts, drain boxes, and related structures.
   (F)   General street design criteria. The Access Management and Roadway
Manual shall guide the design for block length, street intersections,
intersections and sight distance, street names, street signs, dedication of
right of way, dead-end streets, half-streets, streetlights and other criteria
of design.
   (G)   Street construction. The Access Management and Roadway Manual shall
guide the construction of streets, including grading and embankments, cut
section elevation, solid rock excavation, sub-grade preparation, concrete
streets, bituminous concrete on macadam base, street cross sections, curbs and
gutters and other criteria.
   (H)   Pedestrian walkways.
      (1)   Pedestrian walkways (sidewalks) are designed to provide for
pedestrian safety and circulation. They also serve as important elements in the
recreational system by providing space for walkers, hikers, and joggers.
      (2)   Sidewalks are the responsibility of the developer and are to be
provided in all residential subdivisions on both sides of the street.
Pedestrian walkways shall be required for all commercial and industrial lots as
determined by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   The Access Management and Roadway Manual provides design criteria
for sidewalks in Chapter 13.
   (I)   Bikeways and shared-use trails.
      (1)   A bikeway may be substituted for a sidewalk in areas where schools,
parks, or other public facilities exist and may cause a high volume of bicycle
traffic to ensure the safety of cyclists and encourage greater use of bicycles
as an alternate means of transportation.
      (2)   Chapter 13 of the Access Management and Roadway Manual provides
guidance on the design of shared-use trails, bike lanes, and bike routes.
   (J)   Street signs. The developer shall install permanent street signs
according to city standards in subdivisions. For more information, refer to
Chapter 8 of the Access Management and Roadway Manual.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.074 PUBLIC UTILITIES AND FACILITIES.
   (A)   Administration.
      (1)   The Planning Commission's administration of these regulations shall
take into account the relationships between new development and the adopted
community plans for public facilities and utilities. Proposed development shall
be considered in terms of required service by sanitary sewer facilities, water
supply, stormwater drainage, energy supply, and communications services. Where
necessary, the Commission shall require the provision of exclusive utility
easements consistent with the need to serve the proposed and future
development.
      (2)   Specifications for public utility improvements shall meet the
requirements provided by the agency responsible for the requested service.
   (B)   Water, gas, and sanitary sewer system improvements.
      (1)   All development within the city shall be served public water and
sanitary sewer. The provision of gas is optional. The developer shall be
required to provide an adequate potable water supply to all lots in the
subdivision/development. The water distribution system shall be designed and
constructed so as to form an integral part of the existing water distribution
system and shall be in conformance with the city's Comprehensive Plan. In
addition, the distribution system shall be in accordance with the current
standards of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet, the
State Fire Rating Bureau, and the Richmond Utilities Infrastructure Development
Manuals. These manuals are incorporated herein by reference and include
detailed specifications and drawings indicating the required practices and
materials to be used for the construction of projects that will be turned over
to Richmond Utilities upon completion. Additionally itemized in the
Infrastructure Development Manuals are guidelines for the required submittals,
construction, inspections, and as-built construction documentation of the
subject project.
      (2)   The quantity of water delivered to the water distribution system
shall be sufficient to adequately, dependably, and safely supply the total
reasonable requirements of its customers under maximum consumption conditions.
      (3)   The water distribution system shall provide for fire protection in
addition to meeting domestic use requirements. Fire hydrants shall be spaced
not farther than 500 feet apart as measured over hard-surfaced roads, and in no

commercial buildings shall have Knox Boxes placed on the building and any other
building deemed necessary by the City Fire Chief. Location will be assigned by
the City Fire Department. All fire connections shall have Knox Fire Department
connection caps placed on the fire department connection. Knox Boxes and Knox
Fire Department connection caps shall be ordered thru the City Fire Department.
The costs of the above items are the responsibility of the developer and or
property owner.
      (5)   Water mains shall be a minimum of eight inches in diameter. Water,
gas, and sanitary sewer system improvements are provide by the City Utilities
Board. Following the Technical Advisory Committee meeting, the developer and
the developer's engineer shall be required to execute and agreement with
Richmond Utilities in accordance with the Procedures Manual For Richmond
Utilities Infrastructure Development and the related technical manuals.
      (6)   Richmond Utilities will not be responsible for the technical
accuracy of the design plans, and will review the plans from a general design
and administrative basis. Following the project's completion as per the
Richmond Utilities acceptance requirements, the developer's engineer is
responsible for providing a copy of the recorded deed on computer disk as well
as a 24 inches x 36 inches blue/line drawing. The developers engineer will also
provide engineer's digital record drawings (as-built drawings) on computer disk
and 24 inches x 36 inches blue/line copy of the drawing before or at the time
of the developer's request of acceptance of donated utilities. In addition, the
developer's engineer will insure that the as-built drawings and the final plat
shall be properly geo-referenced onto the Richmond Utilities Geographic
Information System (GIS) Base Map.
      (7)   During the installation of all water lines and fire hydrants, the
developer and/or the contractor must notify the City Fire Department and the
Richmond Utilities Board so they may inspect said improvements. No improvements
shall be covered or concealed until they have been approved by both agencies.
No building permits shall be approved until the system is activated.
      (8)   Sanitary sewage disposal shall be available for all proposed
development and shall be designed, constructed, and inspected by the Richmond
Utilities Board and shall meet the following requirements:
         (a)   The minimum lateral size pipe connection to any residential
dwelling shall be four inches inside diameter (i.d.).
         (b)   The minimum size sewer pipe to be used in a residential
subdivision shall be eight inches.
         (c)   Each lot shall be provided with a separate and independent
lateral.
         (d)   Multi-family dwelling units two through 12 units shall be

inch common lateral line with a minimum four inch i.d. sanitary lateral.
Sanitary lateral design for multi-family developments of more than 12 units
shall be reviewed and must be approved by the Richmond Utilities Board prior to
the commencement of construction.
         (e)   No sanitary sewer system shall be used to dispose of
stormwaters.
         (f)   Sanitary sewage system plans shall show pipe sizes, types of
pipe, location, type, and size of all lift or pumping stations and treatment
facilities (as needed). Such plans shall be designated as a logical extension
of the existing public sewer system including trunk lines as needed to serve
the subject tract and future extensions of the system.
      (9)   Whenever the city deems it appropriate and necessary to protect
public health, safety and general welfare, and in keeping with the
implementation of the Comprehensive Plan, the developer may be required to
install water and sewage system improvements in excess of stated requirements.
In these cases, the developer may be reimbursed by the utility agency for the
difference in cost between the facilities actually needed in the development
and the cost of facilities necessary to provide for planned future development.
   (C)   Electric, telephone, and other improvements. Electric, telephone,
cable, and other related services not described elsewhere in these provisions
should be provided within each subdivision according to the specifications of
the appropriate agency providing the service.
   (D)   Stormwater management.
      (1)   These regulations affect all subdivision and development of land
within the city. Storm sewer systems are designed to collect and convey
stormwater runoff from street inlets, runoff control structures, and other
locations where the accumulation of stormwater is undesirable. The objective is
to remove runoff from an area fast enough to avoid unacceptable amounts of
ponding damage and inconvenience.
      (2)   In general, the amount of stormwater runoff should be equal in
terms of pre-development and post-development given the design of the
stormwater system. Stormwater runoff from a site or subdivision shall not
adversely impact natural drainage from an uphill drainage basin or to a
downhill drainage basin or adjacent properties. The property owner shall be
responsible for stormwater drainage facilities located on private property
where runoff will be collected within that property and be minimally discharged
over a larger area before the stormwater naturally drains on adjacent
properties unless a large drainage basin exists or is being planned. Stormwater
drainage easements shall be required if stormwater is discharging directly from
a pipe to an adjoining property and being dispersed on the property. No storm
sewer construction shall occur until permission has been granted by the
appropriate agency. All stormwater infrastructure components shall be inspected
and certified by the owner/developer's engineer.
      (3)   In addition, the city operates under the requirements of the
Kentucky Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (KPDES), under which the city
must develop, implement, and enforce a program to reduce pollutants from any
stormwater runoff resulting from construction activities that result in a land
disturbance greater than or equal to one acre. Accordingly, all construction
site development of one acre or more must provide the following information
before commencement of construction activities:
         (a)   Provide the city's Code and Planning Office with a signed copy
of the completed notice of intent (NOI) form, KPDES form NOI-SW, within 48
hours prior to the initiation of site work.
         (b)   At the time of request for a development plan review by the
Planning Commission, the city's Code and Planning Office must receive a
completed copy of the site-specific best management practices plan at a scale
not greater than one inch=50 feet. The Technical Advisory Committee shall
review this information at its regular meeting.
         (c)   Within 24 hours of the final design, provide the city with any
updates to the best management practices plan made during the actual
construction process.
         (d)   Provide the city with a signed copy of the notice of termination
(NOT) within 48 hours of submittal to the state.
      (4)   As provided for in Ordinance 03-57, the city has the right to 1)
enter and inspect construction sites with any land disturbances for the
presence of properly installed and functioning sediment control best management
practices and to assure compliance with the BMP site specific plan, 2) to
review the records of the permittee and/or his contractor at both on-site and
off site locations that pertain to the development, installation, maintenance,
and operation of the BMP Plan, and 3) to require modification to the BMP plan
along with the correlating physical placement of the modifications at the site,
when in the opinion of the city the current BMPs are not functioning to the
degree necessary to prevent or minimize erosion or to provide proper sediment
control. All expense for modifications required by the city shall be borne by
the permittee and/or his contractor. No expense for proper maintenance or
operation shall be borne by the city.
      (5)   Where the permittee and/or his contractor is found to be in non-
compliance, each non- compliance item shall be corrected within five working
days of notification. The first occurrence of non-compliance shall result in an
issue of notice of violation; the second occurrence or continued non-compliance
shall result in a stop work order; the third occurrence or continued non-
compliance shall result in a $500 fine per calendar day of non-compliance along
with a filing of a complaint with the Kentucky Division of Water. The city has
the right to take civil action against any permittee and/or contractor that
consistently and persistently fails to comply with the requirements of
Ordinance 03-57.
      (6)   Stream buffers.
         (a)   The purpose of this section is to establish minimum acceptable
requirements for the design of buffers to:
            1.   Protect the streams, wetlands, and floodplains of the city.
            2.   To protect the water quality of watercourses, reservoirs,
lakes, and other significant water resources.
            3.   To protect the riparian and aquatic ecosystems
            4.   To provide for the environmentally sound use of the city's
land resources.
         (b)   It is the desire of the city to protect and maintain the native
vegetation in riparian and wetland areas by implementing specifications for the
establishment, protection, and maintenance of vegetation along all stream
systems within our jurisdictional authority.
      (7)   Streams.
         (a)   Perennial and intermittent watercourses identified through site
inspection and US Geological Survey (USGS) maps. Perennial streams are those
which are depicted on a USGS map with a solid blue line. Intermittent streams
are those which are depicted on a USGS map with a dotted blue line. Both
perennial streams and intermittent streams are subject to design guidelines for
stream buffers. The specifications read as follows:
            1.   Protects the physical and ecological integrity of the stream
ecosystem.
            2.   Begins at the edge of the stream bank of the active channel
and extend a minimum of 25 feet from the top of the bank.
            3.   Allowable uses within this zone are highly restricted to:
               a.   Flood control structures;
               b.   Utility right of ways;
               c.   Footpaths; and
               d.   Road crossings, where permitted.
         (b)   The stream buffer, including wetlands and floodplains, shall be
managed to enhance and maximize the unique value of these resources. Management
includes specific limitations on alteration of the natural conditions of these
resources. The following practices and activities are restricted within this
buffer:
            1.   Clearing of existing vegetation;
            2.   Soil disturbance by grading, stripping, or other practices;
            3.   Filling or dumping; and
            4.   Drainage by ditching, underdrains, or other systems.
         (c)   The following structures, practices, and activities are
permitted in the stream buffer, with specific design or maintenance features,
subject to the review and approved of the Planning and Zoning Department:
            1.   Roads, bridges, paths, and utilities.
               a.   An analysis needs to be conducted to ensure that no
economically feasible alternative is available.
               b.   The right-of-way should be the minimum width needed to
allow for maintenance access and installation.
               c.   The angle of the crossing shall be perpendicular to the
stream or buffer in order to minimize clearing requirements.
               d.   Development plans must include a flood study to determine
impacts on FEMA regulatory floodplains. Increase in the base flood elevation or
any change to the regulatory floodway must be addressed through proper
submittals to FEMA.
            2.   Stormwater management.
               a.   An analysis needs to be conducted to ensure that no
economically feasible alternative is available and that the project is either
necessary for flood control, or significantly improves the water quality or
habitat in the stream.
               b.   In new developments, onsite and non- structural
alternatives will be preferred over larger facilities within the stream buffer.
               c.   When constructing stormwater management facilities (i.e.,
BMPs), the area cleared will be limited to the area required for construction
and adequate maintenance access
               d.   Material dredged or otherwise removed from a BMP shall be
stored outside the buffer.
               e.   Individual trees within the forest buffer that are in
danger of falling, causing damage to dwellings or other structures, or causing
blockage of the stream may be removed.
         (d)   All drainage buffer areas shall be maintained through a
declaration of protective covenant or by property owners in which case shall be
documented on the final plat and/or the approved development plan. Any approved
covenant shall be recorded in the land records and shall run with the land and
continue in perpetuity.
   (E)   Basic design criteria.
      (1)   (a)   Degree of protection required. The storm drainage system
shall be adequate to handle the runoff from storms having various frequencies
of occurrence for various degrees of site development, in accordance with the
following general categories:
 
Conservation, agricultural, residential, commercial, 25-year frequency
industrial, and concentrated high-value areas
Flood control facilities                             100-year frequency
 
         (b)   The runoff compared from these storm frequencies shall be from
the area within the subdivision and all other areas draining thereto.
      (2)   Determination of quantity of runoff for design of stormwater
collection systems. Each portion of the stormwater drainage collection system
shall be capable of handling the peak flow of runoff. For drainage areas less
than 200 acres, the method that shall be used is the "Rational Method." For
areas greater than 200 acres, either the "Soil Conservation Service (SCS)
Method or the "Rational Method", where Q=CIA of the Kentucky Transportation
Cabinet, Bureau of Highways shall be used.
         (a)   Q = peak runoff quantity in cubic feet per sound;
         (b)   C = runoff coefficient varying with perviousness and other
characteristics of the drainage area;
         (c)   I = average intensity of precipitation in inches per hour,
varying with frequency of storm occurrence, duration or concentration time, and
area of the tributary watershed;
         (d)   A = area in acres of tributary watershed.
      (3)   Runoff coefficients. The runoff coefficient is the portion of the
precipitation expressed as a decimal that will reach a given stormwater
facility. Each lot within a subdivision contributes runoff from the roof,
driveway, sidewalk, and street. Generally, the smaller the lot width, the less
impervious area. As the lot increases in width, so does the impervious area.
Weighted coefficients shall be used with the impervious areas C = 0.95 and all
other areas C = 0.40. Residential developments shall be calculated using lot
impervious areas as follows:
Land Use Average Percent Impervious Hard Surface Area
Land Use                      Average Percent Impervious Hard Surface Area
Previous and/or existing pre- Varies                     Varies

Impervious areas, including   72                         To be calculated
streets, roofs, and flatwork
 
      (4)   Intensity of precipitation. The "point" values of average
precipitation intensity in inches per hour, at Richmond can be extrapolated
form Exhibit #2-504.5 Kentucky Bureau of Highways "Rainfall Intensity-Duration-
Frequency Curves" for Lexington. For any given storm duration (concentration
time to runoff) the curves show the average precipitation intensity of storms
having two, five, ten, 25, 50, and 100 year frequencies.
      (5)   Time of concentration (TC). The time of concentration (TC) in
minutes, is the estimated time it will take the storm runoff from the most
remote part of the area to reach the point of the storm drainage system under
consideration. This includes the time for water to flow over roofs, through
roof gutters and downspouts, over ground, turfed areas, streets, through street
gutters to the nearest inlet of the drainage system plus the time of flow in
sewer pipes to the point under consideration. Unless otherwise determined by
overland flow charts or nomographs, the time of concentration (TC) for inlets
of stormwater collection systems may be used as follows:
 
Characteristics                       Concentration Time1
                                     Flat       Steep
For residential and undeveloped areas 15 minutes 10 minutes
Residential on 1 acre or larger lots  10 minutes 8 minutes
1   At not time shall the time of concentration be greater than 30 minutes
for design of storm inlets.
 
      (6)   SCS method. All formulas, constants, and data shall be used with
regard to current manual from the US National Resources Conversation Service.
      (7)   Regional method of Bureau of Highways. All formulas, constants, and
data shall be used with regard to the "regional method" from the current Manual
of Instruction of Drainage and Design, Ky. Transportation Cabinet, Bureau of
Highways.
      (8)   Flow times. Flow times in sewers or conduits to the point of design
may be determined from the hydraulic properties of the sewers upstream of that
point, assuming average flow-full velocity at the proposed sewer slopes.
      (9)   Pipe capacities. Public storm sewer pipes shall be designed to
carry peak flows as determined by the methods previously described. At the
design storm, the drainage system shall be designed as an open channel (non-
surcharged) flow. Manning's Formula shall determine sizes. For roughness
coefficients, see the KYTC Drainage Manual.
      (10)   Minimum pipe size. The minimum diameter for public storm sewer
pipe shall be 15 inches.
      (11)   Minimum and maximum velocities. Velocities in public storm sewer
pipes, when flowing full at average peak flows, shall not be less than two feet
per sound. Velocities shall not exceed 15 feet per sound at the flow's re-
entrance into the natural stream, unless approved by the Planning Commission's
Engineer. The outlet velocities of all headwalls shall be shown on the profiles
of the stormwater system.
      (12)   Gradients of pipe. The sewer pipe shall be laid on gradients so
that the velocity (flowing fully) shall be kept within the foregoing stated
minimum and maximum unless other special provisions are made. Pipe sizes should
be selected so as to avoid large differences in velocities between consecutive
reaches.
      (13)   Hydraulic grades. To insure against surface ponding or street
flooding due to surcharging, the hydraulic grade line (HGL) in any inlet or
manhole may not be higher than the inlet grade. The HGL shall be shown on all
profiles of the stormwater system. Design of all public storm sewer
appurtenances shall consider the balance of energy plus the loss due to
entrance in all structures having a critical change in horizontal or vertical
alignment. In no case shall the difference in invert elevations be less than
the result of equal crowns when a smaller pipe empties into a larger one. In no
case shall storm sewer pipe sizes be reduced more than one standard increment
of pipe diameter due to an increase in invert gradient after balancing the
energy losses within the structure.
      (14)   Manholes (junction boxes). Manholes shall be constructed in
accordance with standards as shown in the current Standard Drawings, Ky. Dept.
of Highways Manual. Drop manholes may be required to reduce the slope of any
sewer that has a velocity that exceeds 20 feet per sound. Pipes shall not
extend more than two inches into the side of the manhole, and the invert of the
outlet pipe shall be at the bottom.
      (15)   Inlets (cath basins) capacity. The capacity of the grate on the
inlet should not be less than the quantity of flow tributary to the inlet.
Inlets at low points or sags should have extra capacity as a safeguard for
street flooding from flows overtopping the street curb. A safety swale designed
for the 100 year storm shall be placed at the low points or sags. Curb openings
on combination inlets should be used for overflows in the event that the grate
is clogged. Special inlets may be required for streets with steep gradients to
provide the extra capacity such situations require. All curb inlets are to be a
minimum of five foot open throat boxes and ten foot where needed. Pipes shall
not extend more than two inches into the side of the manhole, and the invert of
the outlet pipe shall be at the bottom. Inlet spacing shall be based upon
gutter and inlet capacity, street slope and contributing drainage area. The
spacing of inlets should ensure that street drainage generated along continuous
grades or sags will not damage and flood private properties. For the design
storm, no more than five cfs shall enter any grade inlet; no more than eight
cfs shall enter any sump inlet; and no more than two and a half cfs is
permitted to flow in side yards between houses. Along continuous grades (less
than 2%- 400 feet maximum;
            (a)   Along continuous grades (2% and over)-600 feet maximum;
            (b)   At sag locations (draining less than 2% grades);
            (c)   400 feet maximum between inlets or from a high point;
            (d)   At sag locations (draining 2% and more grades);
            (e)   600 feet maximum between inlets or from high point inlets may
be required when drainage areas and/or street slopes are excessive.
      (16)   Intersections. Stormwater runoff crossing the intersection of a
street shall be kept to a minimum and must be approved by the Planning
Commission's Engineer.
      (17)   Outfalls. When storm sewer system outfalls into a flood plain of
any major water course, the outfall must not be subject to frequent floods or
backwaters. Standard headwalls and/or headwalls with wingwalls including rock
channel protection as aprons for erosion control, shall be constructed for all
outfalls. Suitable baffles or other energy dissipaters shall be provided if
maximum velocities are exceeded. The invert of the first storm sewer
appurtenance upstream of the outfall structure shall be above the elevation of
the calculated 100 year flood plain for all channels with a drainage area of
more than 50 acres within the project shall be shown on the Improvement Plan.
      (18)   Culverts and bridges. Culverts and bridges shall be designed in
accordance with the methods given in the Kentucky Dept. of Highways Manual of
Location and Design, except that stormwater quantities to be handled by the
culverts and bridges shall be determined on the basis described in these
standards. The allowable headwater (AHW) shall not be greater than HW/D=2+.
      (19)   Headwalls. Standard headwalls for pipe sizes 15 inch through 24
inch and headwalls including wingwalls and aprons for pipes larger than 24
inches shall be constructed at the outfall of all storm sewers in accordance
with standard construction drawings as provided in the current KYTC Standards
Drawings Manual.
      (20)   Other drainage improvement measures. Other drainage improvement
measures may be undertaken to provide the necessary hydraulic characteristics
required for adequate drainage. These other measures include stream bed
clearing, removal of obstructions, stabilization of banks of areas to eliminate
erosion, widening, deepening or realignment of streams, construction of ponds
behind dams, or other measures for adequate drainage.
      (21)   Specifications for construction and materials. See Street and
Storm Drainage Construction Specifications.
      (22)   Lot grading. Within the limits of the public right-of-way adjacent
to street pavements, all final grading for grass strip, sidewalks, and yards
shall comply with minimum and maximum grades in accord with typical sections
for streets as shown in the current city street specifications. For lots that
drain toward the street, the areas between the right-of-way line and the curb
shall be graded so that water drains to the street at a minimum grade of one
inch per foot (approximately 8%) except where sidewalks are required (see
typical sections). All grading behind the street shall be done in a fashion
that does not allow ponding of water adjacent to the paved street. For lots
that drain away from the street, the area between the right-of-way and the curb
shall be graded so that water drains away from the street at a minimum of 1/
2 inch per foot (approximately 4%) except where sidewalks are required.
      (23)   Top soil. If grading results in the stripping of top soil, top
soil shall be uniformly spread over the lots as grading is finished. Temporary
silt barriers should be installed around stock-piled top soil in order to
control erosion.
      (24)   Trees. All development projects should provide for retention of
any existing tree that can be utilized in the final development plan, and the
grading should be adjusted to the existing grade of the trees where practical.
      (25)   Swales. Swales carry surface runoff from roofs, yards, and other
areas to the rear of lots or along common property lines to streets or other
drainage areas to prevent ponding of water near buildings or other portions of
the lot. Surface drainage swales shall have a minimum grade of 2% and shall be
constructed so that the surface water will drain onto a street, storm inlet, or
natural drainage area. Swales for handling lot drainage shall be constructed as
a part of final lot grading and be seeded and mulched or sodded as soon as
possible to prevent erosion.
      (26)   Roof and subsurface drains. Roof downspouts, footing or foundation
drains shall be discharged onto the same parcel of land from which the water is
generated. Roof downspouts shall be piped to natural drainage areas away from
the street or onto concrete splash blocks, which direct water away from the
building into swales, or other natural drainage areas. Downspouts constructed
toward the street shall be discharged on the surface as far back onto the lot
as possible and in no case be closer than 20 feet back from the nearest edge of
the right-of-way line. All subsurface drains shall be constructed toward the
rear of the lot or connected into the storm sewer system. Any connection into a
storm sewer system must be approved by the inspector. Outlets for roof drains
shall have erosion controls in place at the outlet areas to minimize erosion on
site.
   (F)   Erosion controls.
      (1)   General. In order to minimize runoff damage to downstream
properties, sediment pollution of public and private waters and hydraulic
overloading of existing drainage facilities, the stormwater runoff from a
subdivision or development site shall not exceed the pre-development discharge
from that subdivision or development site, calculated by using an undeveloped
runoff coefficient C= (0.40).
      (2)   Drainage channels. Erosion controls for drainage channels shall be
provided to control runoff velocities as follows:
         (a)   Velocities of less than two fps. Design velocities should
generally be greater than one and one-half fps to avoid excessive deposition of
sediments. When flat slopes are unavoidable, concrete paving should be used to
accelerate runoff.
         (b)   Velocities between one and one-half and four fps. The bottom and
sides of the earth channel shall be seeded, mulched, and fertilized to an
elevation of three feet above the design water surface. Seeding shall be a
perennial or annual mixture of grass seeds. At a rate of 75 pounds per acre.
Acceptable whole fertilizer shall be applied at a rate of 75 pounds per 1,000
feet. On slopes of over 5%, the bottom and sides of the earth channel shall be
sodded and pegged to remain in place. Where seeding or sodding is required and
the soil is not capable of supporting vegetation, appropriate action shall be
taken to bring the soil to an acceptable condition, which will support the
growth of seed or sod.
         (c)   Velocities over four fps. The bottom and sides of the earth
channel shall be protected from erosion with an application of stone rip-rap,
coarse aggregate and/or dumped rock channel linings. The type of application
thickness and quantities shall be designed by the engineer to insure
maintenance free permanent stabilization.
         (d)   Reinforced concrete pavement at least four inches thick may also
be used at bends, changes in alignment, junctions with other ditches, and at
other locations where erosion is likely to occur. On slopes over 10%,
consideration should be given to the construction of larger sized channel
linings, gabions (wire boxes) or paved channels with energy blocks or
dissipaters to reduce excessive velocities and damage to receiving streams.
Consideration should be given for the construction of other methods of lining
for erosion control including check dams, drop structures, gabions, etc.
subject to approval by the Planning Commission's engineer.
      (3)   Detention and retention basins. Detention/retention basins shall be
provided for all subdivisions and developments. These basins may be designed
for each individual lot, but regional basins are encouraged to be provided
throughout the development. Such facilities shall be designed so that no
standing water will remain in detention basins during dry weather, or the
design of retention basins that will not allow standing water to stagnate and
present health hazards. In certain cases, other non-basin detention/retention
techniques such as underground vault storage may be utilized when approved by
the Commission. Individual site storm water management shall be reviewed under
the current regulations. The amount of water to be detained shall be determined
by the method described in division (E). Such facilities shall be constructed
in such a way that failure of the structure will not result in loss of life,
damage to homes, or any interruption of public utility use or service. Addition
of trash racks and/or rip-rap around outlet structures in detention/retention
areas shall be installed by the owner/developer.
      (4)   Storage requirements. The amount of detention/retention required
for a subdivision or development shall be the amount determined from the
inflow- outflow hydrograph based on the 25 year storm frequency. If the
Modified Rational Method is used by a computer program, the storm duration used
shall be the one that produces the maximum storage. If calculated by hand, the
duration shall be greater than the time of concentration.
      (5)   Discharge from basins. The discharge from the detention/retention
basin shall be controlled by a multi-stage release structure and not be greater
than a pre-developed runoff rate based on two and 25 year storm frequency at
that particular storage point where the discharge occurs. The routing of an
emergency spillway shall be shown based on the 100 year storm frequency. Trash
racks shall be installed on the low inflow outlet in detention basins.
      (6)   Maintenance of basins. Unless dedicated to and accepted by the
city, the owner of each lot and/or the developer of each subdivision shall be
responsible for properly maintaining each retention/detention basin in order
for such facility to function according to its design and purpose. Maintenance
for the detention/retention areas shall be noted on the plat/development plan,
including access roads. If publicly dedicated, the area shall be included
within the right-of-way and shown on the final plat/development plan. The area
of the pond or lake shall be owned and maintained by the adjoining residents.
This shall include maintaining the shoreline and removing sedimentation and
shall be included in the subdivision's restrictive covenants.
   (G)   Drainage channel or water course relocations. In order to minimize
hillside slippage near relocated drainage channels or water courses due to
drainage channel depth or character of the earth in the drainage channel fill
and side slopes, precautions shall be taken to compact the fill and side
slopes, provision of under drainage, bank protection of reinforcing or other
measures. Additional easement width shall be provided at such possible slide
areas.
   (H)   Best management practices. All subdivisions developments shall have a
best management practices (BMP) document prepared and submitted with the plat
or development plan. This document shall meet the minimum requirements as
stated in the current Kentucky Best Management Practices for Construction
Activities prepared by the Ky. Division of Water. Three copies of the document
shall be submitted and a copy shall be on site at all times. All graded areas
are to be maintained at all times to prevent erosion and excessive runoff.
Several methods used to prevent soil erosion during development are included in
the current city street specifications such as drainage swales, silt checks,
temporary retention dams, etc., and are to be used during the grading
operation. All slopes and graded areas are to be seeded as soon as practical
after the grading operation has been completed and/or building development has
been finished. Additional erosion control measures to prevent erosion and
excessive runoff may be required if the developer or builder has not
accomplished it.
   (I)   Mud and debris. Until all lot and street improvements in the
subdivision have been completed, the developer/contractor and or builder shall
take such measures as are necessary to prevent erosion of graded surfaces, and
to prevent the deposit of soil and debris from graded surfaces onto public
streets, into drainage channels or sewers, or onto adjoining land.
   (J)   Specifications for construction and materials. In all other respects,
the design, materials, and construction shall be as specified in Sections 206,
212, 601, 610, 703, and 710 of the Ky. Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction.
   (K)   Equipment on streets. At any time equipment without rubber tires use
any existing pavements, all necessary precautions shall be taken to insure that
the street surface, gutters, and curbs, receive no damage.
   (L)   Installation of dumpsters in certain multi-family developments. The
multi-family developments to which this section shall have application are
those in which there exist, or those in which there will be constructed, as the
case may be, one or more buildings containing three or more dwelling units.
      (1)   Dumpster to be installed. The owner or developer of all multi-
family developments to which this section has application in accordance with
the above, both those presently in existence within the city and those which
may be constructed in the future, shall be required to install within the
development one or more solid waste dumpsters for the use of the development's
tenants and residents. the city's Director of Planning and Zoning shall
determine:
         (a)   The capacity of each dumpster and the number of dumpsters
required at any existing or future such development, taking into consideration
the number of dwelling units to be serviced and the number of bedrooms within
such dwelling units;
         (b)   The design of the dumpster facility or facilities; and
         (c)   As to existing developments, the placement and location of the
dumpster facility, taking into consideration necessary access to the dumpster,
required parking capacity, and location of other infrastructure, including
overhead and underground utility lines. Placement and location issues relating
to dumpsters as to future developments shall fall within the jurisdiction of
the city's Director of Planning and Zoning and the Planning and Zoning
Commission as future development plans are submitted for review and approval.
      (2)   Variance relating to dumpster requirement in certain cases. The
owner of any existing multi-family development to which this section has
application may request a variance which would effect a waiver as to the
dumpster installation requirement. The city's Board of Adjustments shall have
jurisdiction over any such requested variance, and that Board shall have the
authority to grant a variance only if it finds from the evidence presented that
it is not feasible, due to considerations of access, parking requirements, the
location of utilities within the development, or available space within the
development, to install a dumpster within the development in question. If
parking requirements are an issue as to the variance request, the Board shall
not issue a variance unless it finds from the evidence that the number of
parking spaces which must be forfeited in order to install a dumpster would
result in there being insufficient parking to service the development. The
Board shall be, and hereby is, authorized to grant a variance as to required
parking in order to accommodate a dumpster. In the event that the Board of
Adjustment shall determined to grant the requested variance, the fee paid by
the applicant to appear before the Board of Adjustment shall be refunded.
      (3)   Servicing of dumpsters. Every owner of a multi-family development
to which this section has application shall have the dumpsters within the
development serviced with sufficient regularity to ensure that the tenants of
the development have dumpster room for their disposal of waste. A dumpster
filled to the point that the dumpster lid does not completely close shall be
deemed to be, and is hereby declared to be, a nuisance subject to civil and
criminal sanctions in accordance with the city's existing nuisance ordinance.
      (4)   Effective dates. The requirements of this section shall be
applicable to developments not yet constructed immediately following the
enactment of this section and publication in accordance with applicable
Kentucky law; and to developments presently in existence on January 1, 2013.
      (5)   Penalties. Any violation of the provisions of this section for
which no other penalty is imposed herein shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine in an amount not less than $250 nor more than $500. Each
day that the violation shall continue to exist shall be deemed to be a separate
offense punishable by the imposition of an additional fine.
   (M)   Installation of cluster mailboxes. The purpose of this section is to
provide standards for cluster box style mailboxes in order to comply with
regulations established by the United States Postal Service while ensuring
public safety. All CBUs shall not obstruct free and clear vision of motorists
and shall not impede sight triangles. All residential and commercial
developments shall have CBUs, unless otherwise approved by the Richmond
Postmaster and the Administrative Official.
      (1)   CBU location requirements. CBUs serving housing developments
situated on any public street or roadway shall be located between the sidewalk
and curb or behind the sidewalk with a respective easement. No driveway or
street access shall be constructed within ten feet of a CBU and must be a
minimum of five feet away from fire hydrants and aboveground utility
infrastructure. CBUs shall not be installed within a cul-de-sac and shall not
be located within 100 feet of an intersection.
      (2)   CBUs located in single-family use developments. CBUs must be
located in one of the following:
         (a)   A designated easement between lots;
         (b)   On its own lot designated solely for the CBU and its parking;
         (c)   In an easement within the greenspace; or
         (d)   In a detention area easement outside of the designed 100-year
flood elevation.
      (3)   CBUs located in multi-family or commercial use developments. CBU
locations within multi-family or commercial uses shall be approved by the
Administrative Official.
      (4)   CBU installation and maintenance. The cost of installation,
including but not limited to box units and concrete pad, shall be borne by the
developer. The individual or entity responsible for future maintenance of CBUs
shall be noted on the plan and shall not be the responsibility of the city.
      (5)   CBU accessibility. CBUs shall be provided with an accessible route
which complies with A-117.1-2009: Accessible and Usable Buildings and
Facilities.
      (6)   CBU parking. Parking shall be provided on the same side of the
street and adjacent to all CBUs at a minimum of one space pe 16 boxes, with no
less than one space provided.
      (7)   CBU construction and design requirements. The design and
installation of all CBUs must comply with the regulations established herein
and must be approved by the City Postmaster and Administrative Official. CBUs
must be incorporated on all plans showing the exact location and design and
shall not be identified simply by an exhibit, key note, or detail only.
      (8)   Approved CBU designs. Notwithstanding the regulations stated
herein, the following drawings are pre-approved designs. Any other design will
require additional plan review to ensure compliance with this chapter.

(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.075 COMMUNITY FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE.
   The process of land subdivisions and development represents a long-term
commitment to a particular land use. Included in the land uses are those that
are deemed appropriate for community facilities. It is important that
sufficient land be set aside for public purposes.
   (A)   Official public properties map. If the city has adopted an official
public properties map as provided for in KRS 100.317, which includes such
public uses, then, in addition to the provisions for reservation, the city may
prevent the development of such area by refusing to issue a construction
permit.
Unless such permit is granted, no person shall recover any damages for the
taking for public use of any improvement or structure constructed within the
lines shown on the official map. Any such structure or improvement shall be
removed at the expense of the owner when the land is acquired for public use.
   (B)   Unforeseen development. Where it is considered essential by the
Planning Commission in its review of large scale or planned unit development
not anticipated in the adopted Comprehensive Plan, the Commission may require
the reservation for purchase of such areas of an extent and location suitable
for the needs created by such development for public use for no more than two
years.
(Ord., passed 4-8-25)
§ 157.076 CONSTRUCTION GUARANTEES.
   (A)   Completion of improvements. Prior to the submission of the final plat
to the Planning Commission for approval, the developer shall either have
completed all improvements required by applicable city ordinance or code and/or
depicted on the preliminary plat/construction plans or shall tender with the
application for final plat approval an irrevocable letter of credit as a
construction guarantee as to the remaining improvements, such letter of credit
to be in the form prescribed by the city's Department of Planning and Zoning
and in the amounts to be determined in accordance with the further provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   Construction performance guarantees.
      (1)   (a)   The developer may execute and file guarantees of construction
with the city in lieu of any items listed in the minimum construction standards
prior to the issuance of the construction guarantee in division (A) from the
preliminary plat/construction plans, when requesting approval of the final
plat. However, no structure on a lot can be sold or issued a certificate of
occupancy until such time as all improvements applicable to that lot are
completed.
         (b)   The letter of credit shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning
Department in the amount of: (i) 125% of the cost of the completion of all
remaining improvements; and, (ii) as a guarantee against faulty materials or
poor workmanship, 25% of the cost of the construction and installation of all
required improvements and infrastructure which have been construction at the
time of the application for final plat approval, all of such costs to be
estimated and determined by the city's Engineer or the Planning and Zoning
staff together with any fees associated with inspection of the property. The
letter of credit shall be security for the full performance by the developer
for the construction and installation of all improvements to the property
required by applicable city ordinance or code and/or depicted on the
preliminary plat/construction plans, all of which shall be completed, except as
may be otherwise set forth herein, within 24 consecutive calendar months of the
date of approval of the final plat, or within the time frame of a mutually
agreed upon extension applied for by the developer and formally approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, such extension, however, not to exceed an
additional 12 consecutive calendar months.
         (c)   Any application for such extension shall be made in writing,
shall be filed not less than 90 days prior to the expiration of the initial 24
month period, and shall express in detail the circumstances which have given
rise to the developer's inability to compete the development within the initial
24 month period. The application shall be filed with the Department of Planning
and Zoning not less than ten days prior to the workshop session at which it
will come before the Planning and Zoning Commission for initial review and
consideration.
         (d)   Any provisions hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, at
such time as all require improvements are complete, inspected, and accepted by
the city, with the exception only of portion of sidewalks which adjoin any
vacant lot or lots, the developer may (i) apply for a reduction in the amount
of the posted letter of credit; and (ii) apply for an extension of time beyond
the maximum time for completion set forth above within which to construct and
install sidewalks adjoining such vacant lot or lots; provided, however, that no
such extension shall encompass a period of time in excess of five years from
the date of final plat approval. If such application be made and granted, the
letter of credit shall be reduced to an amount equal to 125% of the estimated
cost of completing remaining sidewalks.
         (e)   Failure of the developer to complete all required improvements
to the property within the time limits above set forth shall entitle, but not
require, the city to make one or more draws against the letter of credit for
the cost of completion. The fact of the existence of the letter of credit
securing the developer's responsibilities and obligations hereunder shall not
relieve or release the developer from its primary liability to complete such
improvements; rather, such liability shall exist and continue until such time
as the improvements are in fact completed and accepted by the city.
         (f)   At such time as the developer has completed all required
improvements, the developer shall notify the Director of Planning and Zoning,
who will then procure necessary inspections. Such notification shall be
accomplished by the developer's submission to the Department of Planning and
Zoning of a written request for final inspection including all development
completion reports required, same to be signed and stamped by a licensed
engineer as to accuracy, together with all fees payable for city inspection. If
the improvements are in conformance with the requirements, Director will so
notify the Planning Commission and shall recommend the release of letter of
credit.
         (g)   No developer, or any principal, owner, director, shareholder,
member thereof, nor any other entity in which the developer or any principal,
owner, director, shareholder, or member thereof is, as to such other entity, a
principal, owner, director, shareholder, or member thereof, who shall have
failed to complete any required improvements, including sidewalks, in a timely
manner as hereinabove set forth shall be eligible to submit another preliminary
or final plat or any development plan for any commercial or business project
until all outstanding developments have been completed and all development
infrastructure has been accepted by the city.
      (2)   Minimum construction prior to issuance of construction guarantee.
The following minimum construction standards must be completed and have passed
inspection by the appropriate agency prior to posting a construction guarantee
or submittal of a final plat. 25% of the total cost of all installed
improvements must have a construction guarantee posted to ensure against faulty
materials or poor workmanship. No structure on a lot can be sold or issued a
certificate of occupancy until such time as all improvements applicable to that
lot are completed.
         (a)   Street sections. All dense graded aggregate (DGA), base, curb
and gutter, except panels for utility crossings, must be in place. The surface
course of bituminous, sidewalk, and bike trail/lane may be included in the
construction guarantee.
         (b)   Storm sewer system. The system must be completed to the point
that it is functional according to the approved engineered plans. The design
engineer shall submit in writing the functionality of the storm system. 25% of
the total cost of the storm water detention or retention system must be bonded
to ensure against faulty materials or poor workmanship and shall remain a
construction guarantee throughout all phases of development.
         (c)   Signage. All street signs and directional signs must be in
place. Street stripping may be bonded.
         (d)   Utilities. It is the responsibility of the utility provider to
approve and accept any and all utilities.
         (e)   Buffers. Approved buffers or landscape buffers may be included
in the construction guarantee.
         (f)   Exceptions. The Planning Commission may approve changes from
these minimum construction requirements in cases where the developer requests a
modification. For any such exception, the developer shall be required to show
good cause for the exception and prove that the intent of these regulations
shall not be impaired by the exception. The Commission shall not take action on
any such case until it has received recommendations in writing from the
affected utility or department. The Commission may require special conditions
to be attached to the final plat where such conditions are necessary to protect
the public interest in the timely completion of the public improvements.
      (3)   Issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy. The Department of
Planning and Zoning shall have the authority, notwithstanding the fact that the
development in question as detailed in the approved development plan has not
been fully completed, to authorize the issuance of a temporary certificate of
occupancy by the Department of Codes Enforcement only in the following
circumstances:
         (a)   The development at issue is either a multi-family or commercial
development;
         (b)   The development as actually constructed when application is made
for the temporary certificate of occupancy is in conformity with all applicable
building codes as determined by the Department of Codes Enforcement and is,
accordingly, suitable and ready for occupancy;
         (c)   Landscaping will require certification form a landscape
architect/professional for seasonal conditions pertaining to plantings with a
cost estimate for landscape completion.
         (d)   The only work remaining to be completed consists of either or
both of landscaping and final coat blacktopping, and, in the case of final coat
blacktopping, the local blacktopping plants have closed and blacktop material
cannot at present be obtained;
         (e)   The applicant has executed the "agreement relating to the
issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy" in the form set forth in the
appendices and has posted the security therein described.
   (C)   Maintenance and repair improvements.
      (1)   The developer is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the
improvements installed. The developer shall be responsible for any damage done
to the improvements by construction traffic, local traffic, or by any other
means, and shall insure the accessibility to all occupied lots until final
acceptance for maintenance by the city. Upon completion of work and prior to
public acceptance, the developer shall clean up all ground occupied or affected
with his work. Failure to maintain or repair improvements may result in
withholding approval of subsequent units of the development, or the billing of
the developer for such cleanup services performed by the city.
      (2)   In developments where the infrastructure has been accepted by the
city any/all developers/contractors working within the development will be
responsible for repairing of city's infrastructure if damaged. Liens may be
placed on all properties under construction to cover the full amount of repairs
to city infrastructure.
   (D)   Liability insurance. The developer shall furnish proof of such
insurance as required by the city which shall indemnify and save harmless the
city from any and all liability arising from any conditions related to the
construction or installation of improvements by the developer. The insurance
shall not be allowed to expire earlier than one year from the date of
acceptance of maintenance by the city. A copy of the policy shall be filed with
the City Clerk.

   (B)   Condominium project application procedures.
      (1)   A developer, owner, or co-owners of a proposed condominium project
shall make application for project approval to the City Codes Enforcement
Officer. Since a condominium involves ownership of single units in a multiple
unit structure, the applicant shall adhere to the appropriate sections of the
zoning regulations dealing with the zone in which the condominium project is

use may divide his unit into two or more smaller units. No interest in the unit
shall be conveyed until the master deed and floor plans have been modified as
provided in this section.
      (3)   Prior to subdividing his unit, the owner shall prepare a set of

plans shall bear the verified statement of registered architect or professional
engineer that they accurately portray the unit involved and the changes being
made, and the unit owner shall attach to the plans a verified statement, which

         (b)   A reference to the book and page of the recorded master deed and
floor plans of the property and any amendments thereto in the office of the
County Clerk in the county in which the land described in the master deed is
situated;
         (c)   The original unit number of each unit involved in the division,
a description or designation of the building in which the unit is located, and

being made.
      (4)   The floor plans and verified statement shall be approved in writing
by a majority, unless otherwise provided by the master deed, or the council of
co-owners, and by any person holding alien on such units, and shall be filed
for record with the County Clerk in the county in which the land described in
the master deed is situated as provided in KRS 381.835. The floor plans and
verified statement shall be considered as an amendment to the original master
deed and floor plans for the sole purpose of dividing a unit and the
corresponding percentage of interest in the common elements. (KRS 381.827).
      (5)   The City Codes Enforcement Officer shall complete his review within
30 days of receipt of the application. If the project is disapproved, the

for planning purposes. Following approval, the applicant: expressly declares,
through the recordation of a master deed or lease (enumerating the particulars
stated above, divisions (B)(3)(a) through (f), the desire to submit the
property in question to the regime established by (KRS 381.815)).
      (6)   Once the property is submitted to the condominium property regime,
an apartment in the building(s) may be individually conveyed and encumbered and
may be the subject of ownership, possession or sale and of all types of
juridical acts inter vivo or mortis causa, as if it were sole and entirely
independent of the other units in the building(s) of which they form a part,
and the corresponding individual titles and interest shall be recordable. (KRS
381.820).
      (7)   Any unit may be jointly or commonly owned by more than one person.
(KRS 381.825).
      (8)   A unit owner shall have the exclusive ownership to his unit and
shall have a common right to a share, with other co-owners, in the common
elements of the property, equivalent to the percentage representing the value
of the individual unit, with relation to the value of the whole property. This
percentage shall be computed by taking as a basis the floor area of the
individual unit in relation to the floor area of the property as a whole.
      (9)   The percentage shall be expressed at the time the condominium
property regime is constituted, shall have permanent character, and shall not
be altered without the acquiescence of the co-owners representing all the units
of the building(s), except as may be otherwise provided in KRS 381.810 to
381.910. The master deed may, however, contain provisions relating to the
appropriation, taking or condemnation by eminent domain by the federal, state,
or local government, or an instrumentality thereof, including, but not limited
to, reapportionment or other change of the common interest appurtenant to each
unit, or part thereof remaining after a partial appropriation, taking or
condemnation. The master deed of a regime under construction may further
provide that by later amendment thereto and upon completion of all units,
percentage of common interest shall be redistributed on an as-built basis;
provided, however, that the number of units originally constituted in the
regime may not be increased during construction.
      (10)   Each co-owner may use the general common elements in accordance
with the purpose for which they are intended, without hindering or encroaching
upon the lawful rights of the other co-owners. (KRS 381.830).
      (11)   If a condominium does not contain any unit which is designed for
occupancy by only one family or household, or if the floor area of all those
units which are designed for occupancy by only one family or household does not
in the aggregate exceed 10% of the floor area of all units in the condominium,
then the following provisions shall be applicable notwithstanding any other
provisions of this chapter.
      (12)   The master deed may provide:   
         (a)   That to any extent specified in the master deed, the common
profits shall be distributed among, and the common expenses shall be charged
to, the unit owners in proportions other than according to their respective
percentages of the undivided interest in the common areas and facilities;
         (b)   That to any extend specified in the master deed, the unit owners
shall not be personally liable for sums assessed for their share of common
expenses, but such provisions shall not adversely affect any lien for said
share;
         (c)   That the priority provided in KRS 381.883(2) shall not prohibit
subordination of a mortgage lien to the lien for commons expenses;
         (d)   A procedure for submitting the disputes arising from the
administration of the condominium to arbitration or other impartial
determination;
         (e)   Provisions giving a particular unit owner or owners voting
rights with respect to election of directors, trustees, or members of a
managing board less than, or in excess of, the voting rights which such owner
or owners would otherwise have had, and provisions requiring or permitting
approval of any matter, or any specified category or categories of matters, by
a proportion greater than a majority, which proportion may be as great as 100%;
         (f)   Terms and conditions differing from those set forth in KRS
381.830 to 381.890 regarding rebuilding made necessary by fire or other
casualty loss, the making of improvements and allocation of the costs of such
rebuilding or improvements, and the removal of the condominium or portion
thereof from the provisions of this chapter; and in such case the terms and
conditions of the master deed shall take precedence over the provisions of KRS
381.830 or 381.890 to the extent they are inconsistent. (KRS 381.837).
      (13)   The deed of each individual unit shall describe such unit by
making reference to the applicable master deed and floor plans required under
KRS 381.835, designating the letter or number or other appropriate designation
of the unit, followed by the words "a condominium unit." Any conveyance of an
individual unit shall be deemed to also convey the undivided interest of the
owner in the common elements, general and limited, appertaining to say unit
without specifically or particularly referring to same. (KRS 381.840)
      (14)   All of the co-owner or the sole owner of a building constituted
into a horizontal property regime may waive this regime and request the county
clerk to regroup or merge the records of the filial estates with the principal
property; provided, that the filial estates are unencumbered, or if encumbered,
that the creditors in whose behalf the encumbrances are recorded agree to
accept as security the undivided portions of the property owned by the debtors.
(KRS 381.850).
      (15)   The merger provided for in KRS 381.850 shall in no way bar the
subsequent constitution of the property into another horizontal property regime
whenever so desired and upon observance of the provisions of KRS 381.805 to
381.910 (KRS 381.855).
      (16)   The administration of every building constituted into a
condominium property regime shall be governed by bylaws approved and adopted by
the council of co-owners. The Council may amend the bylaws from time to time.
(KRS 381.860).
      (17)   Other legal requirements pertaining to bookkeeping, maintenance,
liens, foreclosures, insurance and related business matters can be found by
referring to KRS 381.865 through 381.900.
      (18)   The provisions of KRS 381.805 to 381.910 shall be in addition to a
supplemental to all other provisions of the Kentucky Revised Statutes; provided
that wherever the application of the provisions of KRS 381.805 to 381.910
conflicts with the application of such other provisions, KRS 381.805 to 381.910
shall prevail. (KRS 381.905).

APPENDIX I: PUD REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of Planned Unit Development Zone District is to
encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design of land developments
than is possible under the other district zoning regulations. Planned Unit
Development Zone Districts are intended to allow substantial flexibility in
planning and designing a proposal. This flexibility often accrues in the form
of relief from compliance with conventional zoning ordinance site and design
requirements. Ideally, this flexibility results in a development that is better
planned, that contains more amenities, and ultimately a development that is
more desirable to live in than one produced in accordance with typical zoning
ordinance and subdivision controls. An intrinsic, and often neglected, premise
upon which the approval of a planned unit development (PUD) must be
conditioned, is that while greater density or more lenient requirements may be
granted, the planned unit development should contain features not normally
required of traditional developments. Hence, to enable thorough analysis of a
planned unit development, more information is demanded about the proposal than
would be required if development were being pursued under conventional zoning
requirements.
   (B)   Objectives. Through proper planning and design, each planned unit
development should include features which further, and are in compliance with,
the following objectives:
      (1)   To allow for the design of developments that are architecturally
and environmentally innovative, and that achieve better utilization of land
than is possible through strict application of standard zoning and subdivision
controls.
      (2)   To encourage land development that, to the greatest extent
possible, preserves natural vegetation, respects natural topographic and
geologic conditions, and refrains from adversely affective flooding, soil,
drainage, and other natural ecologic conditions.
      (3)   To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and
structural/visual relationships within an environment that allows mixing of
different land uses in an innovative and functionally efficient manner.
      (4)   To provide for abundant, accessible, and properly located public
open and recreation space, private open and recreation space, schools, and
other public and private facilities.
      (5)   To promote the efficient use of land resulting in networks of
utilities, streets and other infrastructure features that maximize the
allocation of fiscal and natural resources.
      (6)   To enable land developments to be completely compatible and
congruous with adjacent and nearby land developments.
      (7)   To ensure that development occurs at proper locations, away from
environmentally sensitive areas, and on land physically suited to construction.
      (8)   To allow unique and unusual land uses to be planned for and located
in a manner that ensures harmony with the surrounding community.
      (9)   To create a method for the permanent preservation of historic
buildings and/or landmarks.
   (C)   Standards for planned unit developments. The planned unit development
must meet the following standards:
      (1)   Comprehensive plan. A planned unit development must conform to the
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   Site and ownership. The site of the planned unit development must
be under single ownership and/or unified control.
      (3)   Compatibility.
         (a)   The uses permitted in a planned unit development must be of a
type and so located as to exercise no undue detrimental influence upon
surrounding properties.
         (b)   In addition, the planned unit development shall not endanger the
public health, welfare, or safety, nor shall it substantially diminish or
impair property values in the neighborhood in which it is to be located.
      (4)   Need. The planned unit development must be of a character and
contain such uses that are needed in the area of the proposed project.
      (5)   Density. The net density of a planned unit development (either in
dwelling units - for residential uses, or in floor area - for all other uses)
shall generally correspond to the gross density regulations imposed by the
underlying land uses. The gross density of the planned unit development is not
necessarily required to precisely correspond with the normal net density of the
underlying land uses, but instead should reflect that district's character
through complementary building types and architectural design. The gross
overall density of dwelling units in a PUD shall not exceed eight units per
acre.
      (6)   Space between buildings. The minimum horizontal distance between
the buildings shall be:
         (a)   Ten feet between clustered or "zero lot line" single-family
detached buildings.
         (b)   Ten feet between single-family detached dwellings.
         (c)   Twenty feet between buildings, other than single family-detached
dwellings, of one, or two and one-half stories in elevation.
         (d)   Equal to the height of the taller building in the case of free-
standing buildings greater than two and one-half stories in elevation.
      (7)   Yards.
         (a)   The required yards along the periphery of the planned unit
development shall be at least equal in width or depth to that of the adjacent
zoning district.
         (b)   Buildings of more than 12 feet in height shall provide a setback
from any property line of not less than equal to the height of such buildings.
      (8)   Parking requirements. The parking requirements shall be the same in
the PUD zones as they are in the underlying underlying land uses. See §
157.046.
      (9)   Traffic. Adequate provision shall be made to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize both internal and external traffic hazards
and congestion.
      (10)   Design standards. The provisions of this chapter, as amended,
shall be adhered to, unless the Planning Commission grants a waiver.
      (11)   Performance standards. The performance standards for the
underlying land uses of the planned unit development shall, in all instances,
be complied with.
   (D)   Procedure for planned unit developments. The unique character of
planned unit development requires their administrative processing as a special
use in this chapter. Planned unit developments are more complex and of a
significantly difference character than other zoning districts, therefore
requiring the establishment herein of specific procedures different than those
used to process other zoning districts. The procedure, standards, objectives
and purpose set forth in this appendix, when in conflict with other provisions
of this code, as they may pertain to planned unit development, and only planned
unit developments, shall be superseding.
      (1)   Step 1: pre-application procedure.
         (a)   Intent. The intent of the pre-application process is to obtain a
general awareness of the city's adopted planning rationale, the compatibility
of the proposed planned unit development with existing and anticipated land
uses in the vicinity, and a familiarity with the city's planned unit
development procedures. This procedure allows the developer to determine the
suitability of proposed planned unit development procedures. This procedure
allows the developer concerning the approval or construction of the proposed
planned unit development.
         (b)   1.   Pre-application conference. Prior to the filing of an
application for approval of a planned unit development, the prospective
applicant must request of the Plan Commission one informal meeting to discuss
the development of the proposed planned unit development site in conjunction
with the city's adopted planning rationale and its compatibility with existing
and anticipated land uses in the vicinity. Said meeting may be a part of a
regularly scheduled meeting, shall be open to the public, and included on their
agenda in advance of the meeting.
            2.   The pre-application conference is mandatory but does not
require formal application fee, or filing of a planned unit development plat.
However, the expenses incurred by the city as a result of any additional
conferences in excess of the one entitled conference with the Planning
Commission to discuss the development of the proposed planned unit development
site, within a period of one year from the date of the initial Plan Commission
conference on the said proposed planned unit development site, shall be paid
for by the prospective applicant.
         (c)   1.   Pre-application document review. Prior to the filing of an
application for approval of a planned unit development, either before, after,
or in lieu of the pre-application conference, all prospective applicants shall
review copies of the City Land Use Plan, the zoning map, and the planned unit
development sections of this chapter, which are available in the city's
development ordinance. The zoning map shall be reviewed to ascertain whether or
not the proposal is likely to be compatible with existing and anticipated land
uses in the vicinity of the proposal. The planned unit development sections of
this appendix shall be reviewed to insure familiarity with the city's planned
unit development procedures.
            2.   The applicant is required to sign a statement to the effect
that the applicant has reviewed copies of the city's land use map, the zoning
map, and the planned unit development sections of this chapter at the time the
planned unit development zone change application is submitted for approval.
      (2)   Step 2: conceptual plan procedure.
         (a)   Intent. The intent of the conceptual plan submission is to
obtain approval of the city for the development of a parcel of land in accord
with the plans, programs, and schedule submitted as this part of the planned
unit development application.
         (b)   Procedure. A request for approval of a conceptual plan, as a
step in the planned unit development procedure, shall be submitted to the
Office of the Zoning Administrator and subsequently shall be referred to the
Planning Commission for public hearing, review, and recommendation. The
required procedure for review of the plan shall be:
            1.   Submission of the items required of a conceptual plan
petitioner as identified under the "submission requirements" sections of this
appendix. Said submission requirements fall into two general categories:
               a.   Submission of data required at the time application is made
for conceptual plan approval;
               b.   Submission of data required at the time of the first public
hearing pertaining to the specific conceptual plan.
            2.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
application for a planned unit development conceptual plan in accord with the
procedures established for special uses in this chapter.
            3.   a.   Following the public hearing and review of the conceptual
plan submission, the Plan Commission shall within 30 days, unless an extension
is requested by the petitioner, recommend approval, modification, or
disapproval of the conceptual plan, and the reasons therefore, or indicate why
a report and recommendation cannot be rendered to the City Commission.
               b.   In its communication to the City Commission, the Planning
Commission shall set forth "findings of fact," in accordance with the "findings
of fact" section of this appendix, on which the recommendation is based and
describing how the conceptual plan meets the standards and objectives stated in
this Article.
            4.   a.   The City Commission, after receipt of the conceptual plan
from the Planning Commission, shall approve, modify, or disapprove the plan
within 60 days, unless an extension is requested by the petitioner. In the case
of approval, or approval with modification, the City Commission shall pass a
resolution approving the conceptual plan. Said ordinance shall provide for a
change in the official city zoning map indicating that the subject site is
approved for a planned unit development for further allowing for any approved
zoning amendments, variations, and/or special uses. However, once these map
changes are made, the petitioner must submit subsequent preliminary plat data
in accordance with the schedule set forth in division (G). If it is not done,
all map changes authorized by the City Commission shall revert back to the
original zoning designation affixed to the subject property in accordance with
division (G). The City Commission may require such special conditions, as it
may deem necessary to insure conformance with the objectives and standards
established in this appendix.
               b.   It is emphasized that no building or construction
whatsoever may take place within the proposed planned unit development and no
permits may be issued, until the final plat and accompanying data has been
submitted, approved, and recorded. Approval of the conceptual plan shall
constitute an interim-zoning acceptance of the land use and density concepts
specified therein, and shall indicate the general acceptance of the Planning
Commission to approve a "preliminary plat" that carries out, refines, and
implements the concepts expressed in the conceptual plan.
      (3)   Step 3: preliminary plat procedure.
         (a)   Intent.
            1.   It is the intent of the preliminary plat submission to obtain
tentative approval from the Planning Commission for the plans, design, and
program that the petitioner contemplates compliance with. If the preliminary
plat is approved, the petitioner can proceed to the construction plans, final
plat stage with reasonable assurance that the final plat will be approved if
substantially in compliance with the preliminary plat.
            2.   Any parcel of property may be eligible for consideration as a
planned unit development using the preliminary plat procedure. However, each
petitioner for preliminary plat approval should be aware that the objectives
and standards for planned unit developments, as expressed in this appendix,
must be clearly integrated into the planned unit development submission.
Failure to do so will result in disapproval.
         (b)   Procedure. A request for approval of a preliminary plat, as a
step in the planned unit development procedure, shall be submitted to the
Office of the Director of Planning and Zoning, which shall refer same to the
Planning Commission for public hearing, review and recommendation. The required
procedure for review of the preliminary plat shall be:
            1.   Submission of the items required of a preliminary plat
petitioner as identified under the division (E). Said submission requirements
fall into two general categories:
               a.   Submission of data required at the time application is made
for preliminary plat approval;
               b.   Submission of data required at the time of the first public
hearing pertaining to the specific preliminary plat.
            2.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
application for a planned unit development preliminary plat in accord with the
procedures established for special uses in this chapter.
            3.   a.   Following the public hearing and review of the
preliminary plat submission, the Planning Commission shall within 60 days,
unless an extension is requested by the petitioner, recommend approval,
modification, or disapproval of the preliminary plat.
               b.   It is emphasized that no building or construction,
excluding public improvements, may take place within the proposed planned unit
development, and no permits may be issued, until the preliminary plat and
construction plans and accompanying data has been submitted, approved. Several
projects or stages may compose the overall planned unit development. If this is
the case, the final plat may be submitted and approved in several states in
accordance with the agreed to development schedule processed with preliminary
plat data. permits shall be issued pursuant to the processing, approval, and
recording of each separate stage of the overall final plat. approval of a
preliminary planned unit development plat shall not constitute approval of the
final plat. rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layout
submitted on the preliminary plat and as a guide to the preparation of the
final plat, which will be submitted for approval of the city and subsequent
recording, upon the fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and
conditions of the preliminary approval, if any. the final plat shall be
approved if it conforms to the preliminary plat and construction plans.
      (4)   Step 4: construction plan procedure.
         (a)   All final plats, which contain a lot or lots requiring
installation of improvements shall have eight copies of construction plans
submitted to the Planning and Zoning office for approval ten days prior by 12:
00 p.m. to the Technical Advisory Committee meeting. Upon review and approval
of the construction plans per method and procedure adopted by the Planning
Commission, one set shall signed approved by the Planning and Zoning Director/
Planning and Zoning Engineer and returned to the applicant. Said construction
plans shall be submitted and approval at minimum 30 days prior to approval of
the final plat.
         (b)   Please refer to §
157.062 for all construction plan requirements and procedures.
      (5)   Step 5: final plat procedure.
         (a)   The final plat serves as a plat of record for public recording
and transfer of land, and as a check to assure that subdivision requirements
(including any conditions stipulated in the preliminary plat) have been met.
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat and
construction plans as approved, and it may constitute only a portion of the
preliminary plat, which the developer proposes to develop and record. No final
plat shall be approved until at least 30 days following the approval of the
construction plans. The Planning Commission at the business meeting will review
no final plat until either all improvements on the preliminary plat/
construction plans have been made or all unfinished items have been guaranteed
by a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit.
         (c)   Please refer to §
157.062 for all final plat requirements and procedures.
   (E)   Submission requirements.
      (1)   Conceptual plan stage. At the time application is made for zoning
map amendment the conceptual plan must also be submitted which shall include
the following:
         (a)   Application. A written application for a planned unit
development on forms supplied by the Office of the Planning and Zoning
Administrator.
         (b)   Fee. That is suitable to cover costs incurred by the city for
review of the specific proposal. If special planning, engineering,
architectural or other consultants must be retained by the city for review of
the proposed planned unit development, the petitioner shall be so notified, and
all costs for said consultants expended by the city- not covered by the filing
fee- shall be reimbursed by the petitioner.
         (c)   Amending the official map. Please refers to §
157.036(B) for all requirements for amending the official zoning map.
         (d)   At the time of the public hearing, 15 copies of all subsequent
listed information shall be submitted (with the exception of non-reproducible
exhibits). The conceptual plan submission shall include the following:
            1.   Concept plan. A drawing of the planned unit development shall
be prepared at a scale that provides for a clear understanding of the way in
which the property is intended to be developed. The plan shall indicate the
concept of the development with refinements to indicate the overall land use
pattern, general circulation system, open space or park system, and major
features of the development. This section does not require a detailed site plan
of buildings, walks, etc. The plan should include:
               a.   Boundary lines and dimensions of the subject site.
               b.   Existing and proposed easements--general location and
purpose.

the existing road network, and adjunct vehicle volumes, and the effect the
proposed planned unit development will have on the existing (or improved) road
network. If traffic or roadway improvements external to the subject site are
anticipated as a result of the proposed development, the petitioner shall
submit a statement indicating the nature and extent of those contemplated
improvements. Included in said statement shall be information pertaining to
what proportion of the external traffic and roadway improvements made necessary
as a result of the planned unit development, if any, the developer will pay
for. All internal traffic and roadway improvements associated with the planned
unit development shall be paid for by the developer.
            8.   Percentage of usable green space: minimum of 20% of green
space.
      (2)   Preliminary plat stage.
         (a)   At the time application is made for preliminary plat approval,
the following items must be submitted to the Office of the Director of Planning
and Zoning, if a zone map amendment and a conceptual plan approval has been
granted:
            1.   Fee. A preliminary plat filing fee, established by the city to
cover costs incurred by the city for review of the specific proposal. If
special planning, engineering, architectural, or other consultants must be

         (b)   At the time of the TAC submittal on the preliminary plat, 15
copies of all subsequent listed information shall be submitted (with the
exception of non-reproducible exhibits). Failure to submit any of the required
information, without a specific written waiver from the Planning Commission,
shall constitute grounds for dismissal of the planned unit development
petition. For that particular month. The preliminary plat submission shall
include the following:
            1.   All ten items listed in (E)(1) above.
            2.   Detailed plan. A drawing of the planned unit development shall
be prepared at a scale of not less than one inch = 50 feet unless approved at
another scale by the Director of Planning and Zoning and shall show such
designations as proposed streets (public and private), all buildings and their
use, common open space, recreation facilities, parking areas, service areas,

as documentation of these facilities' points of origin.
            4.   Community benefit statement. A written statement comparing the
relative benefits that will accrue to the community as a result of this site
being developed under planned unit development provisions as opposed to
conventional zoning. Specific mention should be made of open space, natural
features, and architectural design. This statement supplements the "objectives"
statement that may be required with the submission of the conceptual plan or
the preliminary plat. The "objectives" statement differs from this statement,
in that each of the objectives listed in division (A) must be specifically
addressed. In contrast, the "community benefit statement," which accompanies a
detailed site plan, provides a developer the opportunity to define with
particularity why his proposal merits approval and how it will serve the
community better than a conventional development.
      (3)   Construction plan stage.
         (a)   All final plats, which contain a lot or lots requiring
installation of improvements shall have eight copies of construction plans
submitted to the Planning and Zoning office for approval ten days prior to the
TAC meeting by 12:00 p.m. Upon review and approval of the construction plans
per method and procedure adopted by the Planning Commission, one set shall
signed approved by the Planning and Zoning Director/Planning and Zoning
Engineer and returned to the applicant. Said construction plans shall be
submitted and approval at minimum 30 days prior to approval of the final plat.
         (b)   Please refer to §
157.062 for all construction plan requirements and procedures.
      (4)   Final plat stage.
         (a)   The final plat serves as a plat of record for public recording
and transfer of land, and as a check to assure that subdivision requirements
(including any conditions stipulated in the preliminary plat) have been met.
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat and
construction plans as approved, and it may constitute only a portion of the
preliminary plat, which the developer proposes to develop and record. No final
plat shall be approved until at least 30 days following the approval of the
construction plans. The Planning Commission at the business meeting will review
no final plat until either all improvements on the preliminary plat/
construction plans have been completed or all unfinished items have been
guaranteed by a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit.
         (b)   Please refer to §
157.062 for all final plat requirements and procedures.
      (5)   Development plan stage.
         (a)   Upon completion of the final plat stage the development will be
required to go through the development plan process for each area of the total
development in which has a underlying zoning district that would normally call
for a development plan.
         (b)   Please refer to §
157.062 for all development plan requirements and procedures.
   (F)   Changes in the planned unit development. The planned unit development
shall be developed only according to the approved and recorded final plat and
all supporting data. The recorded final plat and supporting data together with
all recorded amendments shall be binding on the applicants, their successors,
grantees, and assigns and shall limit and control the use of premises and
location of structures in the planned unit development project as set forth
therein. Changes to the recorded planned unit development may be made as
follows:
      (1)   Major changes.
         (a)   Changes which alter the concept or intent of the planned unit
development including increases in density, reductions of proposed open space,
changes in total bedroom counts of more than 5%, changes in bedroom mixes of
more than 5%, changes in road standards, or changes in the final governing
agreements, provisions, or covenants, may be approved only by submission and
reconsideration of a new preliminary and/or final planned unit development
plat, or relevant portion thereof, and supporting data and following the
preliminary or final plat procedure.
         (b)   If the major change alters data or evidence submitted during the
conceptual plan or preliminary plan or preliminary plat stage, then the re-
submission must begin at the preliminary plat stage. If only final plat
evidence or data is altered as a result of the major change, then the re-
submission shall begin at the final plat stage.
         (c)   If major changes are proposed, a new public hearing shall be
required during re-submission of the preliminary or final plat.
         (d)   All changes to the "original" final plat shall be recorded with
the County Clerk as amendments to the final plat or reflected in the recording
of a new "amended" final plat.
      (2)   Minor changes. The Planning Commission may, in accordance with
procedures established in their rules, approve minor changes in the planned
unit development, which do not change the concept or intent of the development.
Minor changes shall be any change not defined as a major change.
   (G)   Revocation and extension. A planned unit development special use shall
become null and void and the subject property shall thereupon be re-zoned to
its most appropriate district classification, as deemed suitable by the City
Commission acting upon the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, in any case where said planned unit development has:
      (1)   Received preliminary plat approval and where the final plat of said
planned unit development, or the first phase of the final plat if construction
is to take place in phases, has not been submitted for approval within two
years after the date of approval of said preliminary plat; or
      (2)   Received final plat approval and where the construction of said
planned unit development, as authorized by the issuance of a building permit,
has not begun within one year after the date of approval of said final plat
dealing with such construction.
