   The legislative body of the city finds and declares that:
   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts;
   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of the city depends upon
the public’s confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers
and employees. Whenever the public perceives a conflict between the private
interests and public duties of a city officer or employee, that confidence is
imperiled; and
   (C)   The government of the city has a duty to provide its citizens with
standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.

KRS 65.003, as enacted by the 1994 State General Assembly.
   (C)   This article is enacted under the power vested in the city by KRS
82.082 and pursuant to requirements of KRS 65.003.

City ABC Administrator, or any member of his or her staff, or any state ABC
Administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed
application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending
before such officer. This paragraph is not intended to stifle expressions of

public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of law, both
local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the
revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes,
threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or state ABC

beverage licensing, sales or the administration thereof. Additionally, any
license may be revoked or suspended by the City ABC Administrator if the
licensee shall have violated any of the provisions of KRS Chapters 241—244, or
any rule or regulation of the ABC Board or of the Department of Revenue
relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale, and transportation or
taxation of alcoholic beverages or if such licensee shall have violated or
shall violate any act of Congress or any rule or regulation of any federal
board, agency or commission, or this chapter now, therefore, or hereafter in
effect relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale and transportation
or taxation of the intoxicating liquors or any rules or regulations of the city
heretofore in existence or authorized by the terms of KRS Chapters 241—244 to
be created, irrespective of whether the licensee knew of or permitted the
violation or whether the violation was committed in disobedience of his or her
instructions, or any such license may be revoked or suspended for any cause
which the City ABC Administrator in the exercise of his or her sound discretion
deems sufficient.
      (2)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the City
ABC Administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had
been known. In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be
revoked or suspended for the following causes:

selling any illegal beverages on the premises licensed;

period, any licensee or any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the license
shall have twice been convicted of any felony or of any misdemeanor directly or
indirectly attributable to the use of alcoholic beverages, or of one such
felony and one such misdemeanor;
         (d)   Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee to pay
an excise tax or any part thereof, or any penalties imposed by or under the
provisions of any statutes, this chapter or acts of Congress relative to
taxation, or for a violation of any rules or regulations of the Department of
Revenue made in pursuance thereof; or
         (e)   Setting up, conducting, operating or keeping, on the licensed
premises, any gambling game, device, machine or contrivance, or gift
enterprise, or handbook or facility for betting or transmitting bets on horse
races, or permitting to be set up, conducted, operated, kept, or engaged in, on
the licensed premises, any such game, device, machine, contrivance, gift

temporary licenses, shall begin on January 1 of any year and shall expire on
December 31 of the following year. Any licenses issued after June 30 of any
year shall be assessed a fee which is based on the pro rata portion of the
reminder of the license period, however, the cost of any license shall not be
less than one-half the amount of the full fee for an annual license of that
type.
   (F)   Payment of license fees; delinquency. No licensee shall enter into or
begin operating any business for which a license is required by this chapter
until the license fee has been paid in full. The fee for renewal of any license
shall be paid with the renewal application. Failure to pay any license fee
within ten days after it becomes due shall result in a penalty equal to 10% of
the license fee. Any licensee failing to pay the fees, including penalties,
within ten days after such fees are due may be subject to revocation of the
license and to other penalties as provided in §
4-102.
   (G)   Refund of fees. Should any licensee under this chapter be prohibited
from conducting the licensed business for the full period covered by the
license because of any changes that may hereafter be made in the laws of the
commonwealth with reference to alcoholic beverages or other cause outside
licensee's control, then the city shall refund to licensee the proportionate
part of the license fee for the period during which licensee is prevented from
carrying on said business if the licensee provides sufficient proof to the City
ABC Administrator that such period of inactivity was not the fault of the
licensee or the result of a revocation, suspension or other wrongdoing by
licensee, or an agent or employee of the licensee. In the event a violation of
this chapter occurs that results in the suspension or revocation of the
license, the city shall not be required to refund any portion of the license
fee.
   (H)   Disposition of fees. The city shall transmit any fees received upon
collection into the appropriate designated account.

§ 4-64 LICENSE FORM, ISSUANCE AND DISPLAY.
   (A)   Requirements. All city licenses shall be in such form as may be
prescribed by the City Commission and shall contain:
      (1)   The name and address of the licensee;
      (2)   The number of the license;
      (3)   The type of license;
      (4)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the licensed
premises;
      (5)   The name and address of the owner of the building in which the

      (7)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a property
or vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to law.
   (B)   License information change. If there is a change in any fact required
to be set forth in the application, subsequent the issuance of a license or
license renewal, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change
shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator within ten days of the change.
Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of corporations
or other business organization, it is necessary that ownership changes in such
organizations be reported to the City ABC Administrator. The City ABC
Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the ownership or
management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that person is
precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic beverage license.
      (1)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other
business organization herein, directors or officers of the corporation, or
change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures 10% of the outstanding
ownership or stock. Transfer of more than 10% of the total ownership or stock
shall require a new license.
      (2)   The following information will be required concerning any new
manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any
interest in alcoholic beverage license:
         (a)   Name and address;
         (b)   Nature of interest;
         (c)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
         (d)   Date of birth;
         (e)   Date residence was established in Kentucky, if resident of
Kentucky. If a Fulton resident, indicate when residence was established;
         (f)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license
or LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license under this chapter;
         (g)   Extent of stock or company ownership; and
         (h)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or LLC,
corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license in
any other state or province.
      (3)   This information shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator as
a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was
granted. Filing shall be made within ten days of any change of required
information.
   (C)   Renewal of license. Every year, except in the case of temporary
licenses, each licensee shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be
on file with the City ABC Administrator no less than 30 days prior to the
expiration of the license for the preceding license period or the same shall be
canceled, except where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the
same premises licensed during the preceding license period as a result of
construction, act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of the premises by
any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private organization
possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew exiting
lease, provided that said licensee shall file a written verified statement no
less than 20 days from the expiration date of the license, setting forth these
facts, and the City ABC Administrator is hereby authorized to extend the time
for filing of a renewal of such license for a reasonable length of time within
the sound discretion of the City ABC Administrator, provided, however, such
licensee shall pay a license fee from the expiration date of the former license
or licenses. Said license fee shall not be payable until application is made
for the transfer of said license to a new location. The renewal by the City ABC
Administrator of the license shall not be construed to be a waiver or
acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to such renewal and shall not
prevent subsequent proceedings against the licensee.
   (D)   Guidelines for approval of quota licenses.
      (1)   In the case of quota licenses, before approving an application, the
City ABC Administrator is hereby directed to consider, in addition to the
factors set out in KRS 243.450, KRS 243.490 and KRS 243.500, and any other
factors the Administrator determines in his or her discretion to be reasonable
and pertinent to the license application, the following criteria:
         (a)   Ownership. The city places great value on business owners who
are invested in the Fulton community.
         (b)   Economic impact. The city desires businesses which make the most
positive impact on the community, in number of jobs, payroll, property
investment and revenues to the city.
         (c)   Site of business. The city is interested in serving all
geographic areas of the city. Therefore, the city does not wish to cluster all
licensed ABC outlets in one area.
         (d)   Aesthetics. The city is committed to protecting the character
and beauty of our community.
         (e)   Revitalization of downtown. The city wholeheartedly supports the
revitalization of downtown and the revitalization and reuse of existing
buildings.
         (f)   Capital. The city values businesses that demonstrate their
ability to financially support and sustain their viability.
         (g)   Public support of licensed business in the area. The city
intends that public sentiment and safety be considered in deciding upon the
approval of retail liquor sales licenses in any area of the city.
      (2)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the City ABC
Administrator may appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KRS 241.200.
   (E)   Lost, destroyed or misplaced license. When a license shall be lost,
destroyed or misplaced without fault on the part of the licensee or his or her
agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the original license shall be issued
by the City ABC Administrator after the Administrator shall have been satisfied
as to the facts, provided, however, that the applicant for said duplicate
license shall pay a fee of $10 for the duplicate license.
   (F)   Display. Upon issuance of any license, the licensee shall, at all
times, keep said license posted in a conspicuous place at the office or place
of business mentioned in the license.
(1977 Code, § 3-21) (Ord. passed 4-3-1933; Ord. 2013-19, passed 11-25-2014)
§ 4-65 SEPARATE LICENSE FOR EACH PLACE OF BUSINESS; TRANSFERABILITY.
   No license issued under this article shall authorize the sale of an
alcoholic beverage at more than one place. A separate license must be obtained
for each place where the alcoholic beverage is proposed to be sold, provided,
however, that a license may cover more than one room or place in the same
building or on the same premises. No license issued under the terms of this
article shall authorize the licensee to discontinue selling at one place and
transfer his or her place of sale to another place, without the consent of the
city and of the sureties upon the licensee's bond, nor shall any license be
transferred from one person to another without the consent of the city, to be
obtained only upon the filing of a new application, a new bond by the proposed
transferee, and payment of $100 to the city for transfer administrative fees.
(1977 Code, § 3-22) (Ord. passed 4-3-1933; Ord. 2013-19, passed 11-25-2014)
§ 4-66 PRORATION; RENEWAL.
   No license provided for by this article shall be issued for less than the
full amount prescribed for a full year. Renewal licenses for succeeding years
shall be due and payable on January 1 of every year.
(1977 Code, § 3-23) (Ord. passed 4-3-1933; Ord. 2013-19, passed 11-25-2014)
§ 4-67 REVOCATION AND SUSPENSION.
   (A)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any
law enforcement officer or of the City ABC Administrator, the City ABC
Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license
granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after
the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered
mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such
proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in
opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed
action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing.
Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in
the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or
in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or
claimed. The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for
revocation or suspension shall be prescribed by the City Commission of the city
by municipal order. Such order shall be maintained on file in the office of the
City ABC Administrator and a copy furnished with any notice of proposed
revocation or suspension sent to a licensee. If the City Council shall fail to
adopt such municipal order, the procedures shall be those set out in the
Kentucky Administrative Procedure Act (KRS Chapter 13B). A decision of the City
ABC Administrator revoking or suspending a license may be appealed as provided
in KRS 243.550.
   (B)   Within three days after any order of revocation or suspension of a
license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and
to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to
the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application
for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be
deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his or her license to the City ABC Administrator. If the revoked or
suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of
Police at the request of the City ABC Administrator shall immediately cause one
of his officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to the
City ABC Administrator. When a license has been revoked or suspended, the
former licensee may, with prior approval of the City ABC Administrator, dispose
of and transfer his stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
Appeal from the decision of the City ABC Administrator revoking or suspending a
license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay
further proceedings for revocation. If a license is revoked or suspended by an
order of the City ABC Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the
licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under his license.
Upon the entry of a final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering
revocation or suspension on appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all
operation authorized under this license. If a license is revoked or suspended
by an order of the City ABC Administrator, and the decision is not appealed,
the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under his license.
Upon the entry of a final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering
revocation or suspension on appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all
operations authorized under this license.
   (C)   Review of license; books, records and reports. Applicants to whom a
license is issued pursuant to this chapter shall provide periodic information
demonstrating compliance with the conditions of any license, such as, but not
limited to, the continuing requirement that a minimum percentage of the
applicant's business income is earned from the sale of food. This documentation
shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated with the applicant's
quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide the form schedule to
the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to manufacture or traffic
in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the filing of the quarterly
report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly report shall identify each
catered event by type of event, date and address of the event, and shall
provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of food sales to alcohol
sales during the reporting period. This requirement for filing of reports
notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the premises of any
licensee and examine the books and records to determine whether the licensee is
in compliance with all parts of this chapter. In the event the conditions of
any licensee requirement are not met during any particular quarter, the City
ABC Administrator shall have discretion in determining whether revocation is
appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time
to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee,
the City ABC Administrator may apply an accounting period of at least one year
in determining whether or not the food sale percentage requirement has been
met.
      (1)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain upon the
licensed premises adequate books and records of all transactions involved in
the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and
regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the City ABC Administrator and such city
employees who may assist the City ABC Administrator in his or her review.
      (2)   For the purpose of assisting the City ABC Administrator in
enforcement of this chapter, every licensee required to the ABC Board under KRS
243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the City ABC Administrator.
Copies of any and all reports and correspondences to the ABC Board required by
statute shall be furnished to the City ABC Administrator.
   (D)   Dormancy.
      (1)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after 90 days. Such is the intent of this section.
Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her business
interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various exceptions to
the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
      (2)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a period
of 90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in
division (3) below are proved to the satisfaction of the City ABC
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the City ABC Administrator.
If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the City
ABC Administrator.
      (3)   The provisions of division (2) hererof shall not apply to any
licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a
license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing
lease. Prior to the expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall
furnish to the City ABC Administrator a verified statement setting forth the
fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the
specific reasons set forth herein, and the City ABC Administrator may grant an
extension of the dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect
during the license period or until same is transferred to another premises,
notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted during said period,
provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid unless business is
conducted thereunder within 12 months from the date of notice to the City ABC
Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be
for such times as the City ABC Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of
his sound discretion.

§§ 4-72 MANDATORY RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE TRAINING.
   (A)   All persons employed in the selling and serving of alcoholic beverages
shall participate in and complete a city-approved responsible beverage service
training program. For a responsible beverage service training program to be
approved by the city, it must effectively train its participants in the
identification of false age documents and recognition of characteristics of
intoxication. The city will not require enrollment in particular classes, but
only that the training be obtained from a recognized program meeting the goals
expressed in this chapter.
   (B)   All persons required to complete training under division (1) above
shall complete that training within 30 days of the date on which the person
first becomes subject to the training requirement. When a new business is
licensed to serve alcoholic beverages all employees must be trained prior to
the opening of the business.
   (C)   Each licensee shall be responsible for compliance with the training
requirements and shall maintain, for inspection by the City ABC Administrator,
a record or file on each employee that shall contain the pertinent triaging
information. Each premise licensed hereunder must at all times when alcoholic
beverages are being served have at least one person currently certified in
responsible beverage service training on duty.
   (D)   All persons completing the training required by this section shall be
re-certified in responsible beverage service training from a program approved
by the city not less than once every three years thereafter.
(Ord. 2013-19, passed 11-25-2014)
§ 4-73 REGULATORY LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   Pursuant to KRS 243.075, the regulatory license fee on the gross
receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of each license issued by the City ABC
Administrator shall be 7% on gross sales of all alcoholic beverages sold by the
drink beginning with the 2022-2023 fiscal year and continuing at the same
percentage every fiscal year thereafter, unless amended by subsequent ordinance
hereto. In the case of retail sales of package distilled spirits and wine, the
regulatory license fee shall be 7% of gross sales beginning with the 2022-2023
fiscal year and continuing at the same percentage every fiscal year thereafter,
unless amended by subsequent ordinance hereto. The regulatory license fee shall
be 7% on gross retail sales of package malt beverages beginning with the 2022-
2023 fiscal year and continuing at the same percentage every fiscal year
thereafter, unless amended by subsequent ordinance hereto. These fees shall be
paid quarterly. For every fiscal budget year thereafter, the city shall adopt
at the budget adoption for each subsequent fiscal year, such annual rate for
the regulatory license fee as shall be reasonably estimated to ensure full
reimbursement to the city for the cost of an additional policing, regulatory,
or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the
city. Should the city fail to address the regulatory license fee in any budget,
then the regulatory license fee shall remain at the level at which it was last
fixed until such time as the city shall adjust the fee.
   (B)   Payment of such regulatory fee shall be remitted to the City ABC
Administrator, and shall be held in a separate account maintained for the
purpose of fully reimbursing the city for the estimated cost of any additional
policing, regulatory or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic
beverages in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in addition to any
other taxes, fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit against a
regulatory license fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount equal to any
license fee imposed by the city pursuant to KRS 243.070. Payment of the
regulatory license fee shall accompany the tax return approved for such use by
the city. Payments are due no later than by the end of the month immediately
following each calendar quarter.
   (C)   Failure to pay such quarterly remittance within ten days of the due
date constitutes a violation and subjects the licensee to suspension or
revocation.
   (D)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay a quarterly remittance by
the due date shall be 5% of the tax for each 90 days or fraction thereof. The
total late filing penalty shall not exceed 25% of the tax; provided, however,
that in no case shall the penalty be less than $10.
   (E)   Interest at the rate of 8% per annum will apply to any late payments.
   (F)   Upon collection, the city shall transmit any fees received into the
appropriate designated account.

   (A)   When any person complains that he or she is molested by an animal,
which the person deems to be vicious, the Animal Control Officer shall not be
required to pick up the animal unless the Animal Control Officer shall, from
his or her own observation, determine that the animal is, or appears to be, of

against the owner of the animal, in which event, the animal will be picked up
by the Animal Control Officer and held awaiting the trial of the issue between
the owner of the animal and the person filing the complaint.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of an animal to fail
to exercise proper care and control of his or her animal to prevent it from

animal should be quarantined, the animal shall be confined by the Animal
Control Officer in a clinic approved by the Animal Control Officer for a period

person of his or her choice to appear with him or her and participate in the
discussion. The Board of Commissioners shall require the Mayor to participate in

§ 26-44 ENFORCEMENT GENERALLY; FILING COMPLAINTS.
   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he or she will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter “person
aggrieved”) may file a complaint with the Mayor. Complaints shall be in writing
and shall contain information and be in the form as the Mayor requires. Upon
receipt of a complaint, the Mayor shall furnish a copy of the complaint to the
person who allegedly committed or is about to commit the alleged discriminatory
housing practice. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or within 30 days
after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (C) of this
section, the Mayor shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing
to the person aggrieved whether he or she intends to resolve it. If the Mayor
decides to resolve the complaint, he or she shall proceed to try to eliminate
or correct the alleged discriminatory practice by information methods of
conference, conciliation and persuasion. Nothing said or done in the course of
the information endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in a
subsequent proceeding under this article without the written consent of the
persons concerned. Any employee of the Mayor who shall make public any
information in violation of this provision shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   (B)   A complaint under subsection (A) of this section shall be filed within
180 days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints
shall be in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint
against him or her and with the leave of the Mayor, which shall be granted
whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his or her answer
at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If, within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the Mayor, the
Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this article, the
person aggrieved may, within 30 days thereafter, file a complaint with the
Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Mayor will
assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance within 30
days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days hereafter,
commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the respondent named
in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected by this article,
insofar as the rights relate to the subject of the complaint. If the court
finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur,
the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in the practice or order the
affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
Mayor shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain voluntary compliance.

§ 26-45 INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENAS; GIVING OF EVIDENCE.
   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the Mayor shall have access at all
reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and other
evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy the
materials and take and record the testimony or statements of the persons as are
reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation. However, the
Mayor first complies with the provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to
unreasonable searches and seizures. The Mayor may issue subpoenas to compel his
or her access to or the production of the materials, or the appearance of the
persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and
subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or
interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United
States District Court of the district in which the investigation is taking
place. The Mayor may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the Mayor, a respondent shall be entitled
to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the
Mayor to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas
issued by the Mayor himself or herself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a
respondent shall show on their faces the name and address of the respondent and
shall state that they were issued at his or her request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Mayor shall be entitled to the
same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United States
District Courts. Fees payable to the witness summoned by a subpoena issued at
the request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the
person may petition the Mayor to revoke or modify the subpoena. The Mayor shall
grant the petition if he or she finds that the subpoena requires appearance or
attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of
evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does
not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that
compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Mayor or other
person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the
municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom the
subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts business.
   (F)   Any person who willfully fails to attend and testify or to answer any
lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence, if in his or
her power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the Mayor
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person who, with intent thereby to
mislead the Mayor, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement
of fact in any report, account, record or other document submitted to the city
pursuant to his or her subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or
fail to make or cause to be made full, true and correct entries in the reports,
accounts, records or other documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter or by
any other means falsify any documentary evidence, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   (G)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the Mayor
participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this article.

§ 26-46 ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS.
   (A)   The rights granted by §§
26-33 and
26-37 may be enforced by civil actions in state or local courts of general
jurisdiction. Any civil action shall be commenced within 180 days after the
alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. However, the court shall
continue the civil case brought to this section or §
26-44(D), from time to time, before bringing it to trial or renting dwellings.
   (B)   Any person because he or she is or has been, or in order to intimidate
the person or any other person or any class of persons from participating,
without discrimination on account of race, color, religion or national origin,
in any of the activities, services, organizations or facilities described in
this article; or affording another person or class of persons opportunity of
protection so to participate shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (C)   Any citizen, because he or she is or has been, or in order to
discourage the citizen or any other citizen from lawfully aiding or encouraging
other persons to participate, without discrimination on account of race, color,
religion or national origin, in any of the activities, services, organizations
or facilities described in this article, or participating lawfully in speech or
peaceful assembly opposing any denial of the opportunity to so participate
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

quarterly, for the quarterly periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 31 of each year, on or before the last day of the month next following
the quarter of the deduction to the City Treasurer. The employer shall,

Manager in which is set forth the name and residence of each employee of the

wages, commissions or other compensations earned during the preceding year by
each employee. Provided, however, that, the failure or omission of any employer
to deduct the license tax in compliance with the regulations with respect to

the filing of the return by the licensee; provided further that, where the
fiscal year of the business, profession or other activity differs from the
calendar year and the licensee files federal income tax returns for the fiscal
years, the license tax shall be measured by the salaries, wages, commissions or

authorized to assess and to collect any underpayment of license tax withheld at
the source or any underpayment of license tax owing by any license payer, with
respect to earnings. If no return has been filed and a license tax is found to
be owing, the tax actually owing may be assessed and collected with or without
the formality of obtaining a delinquent return from the employer or taxpayer.
   (B)   Should it be disclosed either as a result of an investigation by the
City Manager or through the medium of the filing of a claim or petition for
refund or credit that an overpayment has been made, the city will refund the
overpayment.
   (C)   The employer will in every instance be required to pay the full tax
which should have been withheld, even though he or she may fail to withhold
from the employees. If too much has been withheld, the excess shall be refunded
by the employer to the employee. While the withholding agent, the employer,
will be expected to maintain complete records of the adjustments with the
employees, any adjustment made during any month will not need to be reflected
in the withholding return or disclosed by schedules or statements thereto
attached. However, where adjustments are made between employer and employee,
disclosures shall be made in a statement supporting the annual schedules filed
pursuant to these regulations.

of the Department of Revenue of the state and maintains the privileged

return, or shall attempt to do anything whatever to avoid the payment of the
whole or any part of the license tax, shall become liable to the city for the
taxes as well as interest and penalty thereof and shall in addition, upon
conviction, be subject to the penalty of §
1-10. The criminal penalties shall be in addition to the penalties imposed in
this article.
   (B)   The failure of any employer or license payer to receive or procure
returns, or other forms, is not an excuse for failure to make a return, or to
pay the license tax.

DIVISION 2. RULES FOR SPECIFIC GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES
§ 44-331 INSURANCE AGENTS.
   (A)   General. Individuals engaged in the sale of insurance may be either
employees or independent contractors under this article.
      (1)   Where the individual is subject to the direct control of another as
to the manner of his or her conduct and is paid a fixed fee, he or she is
considered an employee and the amount of the license shall be withheld at the
source.
      (2)   Where the individual is not under the direct control of another and
may conduct the sale as he or she sees fit, receiving his or her payment in the
form of commission from the sale, he or she is considered an independent
contractor and shall file his or her own return and make payment as an
independent contractor.
   (B)   Commissions.
      (1)   In determining whether the commissions payable by reasons of the
selling of any policy by an agent resulted from work done or services performed
or rendered in the city, the test shall be the residence of the insured at the
time of issuance of the policy, rather than the actual place of solicitation,
except where the solicitation is in the city and the agent’s established place
of business is within the city, the commission is subject to the license tax
regardless of the residence of the insured.
      (2)   If an agent has an office outside the city as well as an office of
his or her own within the city, the commission on policies sold to non-
residents, if handled through the outside office, are not subject to a license
tax, since under the circumstances, they are not earnings or profits of an
independent city employee.
   (C)   Group insurance commissions. Commissions paid on the sale of contracts
of group insurance are subject to the license tax under this article if the
group is located within the city as a unit without regard to the residence of
the writing agent.
   (D)   Bonuses and incentive payments. The proportionate part of all bonuses
and incentive payments received by an insurance agent, which bears the same
ratio to the total amount of bonuses and incentive payments received by him or
her, as the amount of commissions received by him or her on policies sold to
residents bears to the total amount of commissions received by him or her on
all policies sold, to both residents and non-residents, is subject to the
license tax under this article.
   (E)   Advances and drawing accounts.
      (1)   There are two main types of advances and drawing account payments:
         (a)   Those which impose upon the agent a written obligation to repay
if they are not in fact earned; and
         (b)   Those which, though offset by commissions as earned, cannot be
recovered at law even though the agent fails to produce enough business to
justify them.
      (2)   The first of these two types of advance and drawing account
payments is in the nature of a loan and accordingly is never subject to a
license tax. All commissions or bonuses, applied toward the repayment of these
types of advances and drawing accounts, are subject in accordance with the
rules set forth in this section.
      (3)   The second type of advance and drawing account payment is subject
compensation under this article when received, to the extent that it exceeds
compensation earned after 7-1-1968.
   (F)   Collection of license taxes at source. It is the duty of all insurance
companies doing business in the city, or general agents in the cases of agents
whose contracts are with a general agent alone and to whom payment is made by
the general agent or of funds of the general agent, to deduct or withhold
monthly or more often the amounts of license tax due on all compensation paid
to agents who are considered employees.

§ 44-332 RAILROAD AND TRAIN SERVICE EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Railroad employees who perform all of their work within the city
limits are subject to a license tax under this article upon their entire gross
earnings.
   (B)   Where the employees are both within and without the city, the license
tax shall be measured by the proportionate share of their gross earnings
representing service within the city.
   (C)   Where the work of the employees is preponderantly outside the city,
the employee shall not be deemed to be engaged in a service within the city.
   (D)   Officers and supervisors personnel whose headquarters is in the city
and whose occupations regularly require part of the work to be done outside the
city shall be allowed to prorate the compensation on which a license is due,
for that part of the work done within the city. There shall be no proration of
compensation for employees headquartered within the city where travel is only
incidentally connected with the occupation. Individual cases of claimed
exemption under this subsection shall be subject to review by the City Manager.
   (E)   No license tax shall be due on compensation of railroad employees for
sick leave.
   (F)   The fact that any particular railroad employee affected by the
regulations of this section may be engaged in interstate commerce, is not
relevant in determining the subjectability to a license tax of compensation
received by him or her.

income under this article, even though exclusive jurisdiction thereof is
granted to the federal government by the state and the city.
   (B)   Compensation received from state, county and municipal governmental
agencies is subject to the provisions of this article.
   (C)   Refund of tax withheld and paid by federal, state or municipal
employees covering activities outside the city will be made to an employee upon
application on a form provided by the City Clerk, but only if the application
is filed with the City Clerk on or before December 31 of the next year after
the year the payment thereof was made.

(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-165 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40
C.F.R. Ch. I, Subch. N, Parts 405 through 471.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, Public
Works Director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with subsections (E) and (F) below.
   (B)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Public Works
Director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as
mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
   (C)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, Public Works Director
shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e).
   (D)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with the following subsections of this section.
      (1)   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with
this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial
user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of subsection (2) of this section are met.
      (2)   Criteria.
         (a)   Either (i) the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 C.F.R. Subch. N specifically provide that they shall be applied
on a net basis; or (ii) the industrial user demonstrates that the control
system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment
standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
         (b)   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
         (c)   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
         (d)   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
   (E)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert
the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Public
Works Director, the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the
industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections (1)(a)
through (1)(e) below.
      (1)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
         (a)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         (d)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         (e)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request
for equivalent mass limits.
      (2)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         (a)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         (b)   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         (c)   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify
the Public Works Director whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in subsection (F)
(1)(c) of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the
Public Works Director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         (d)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection (E)(1)(a)
of this section as long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      (3)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Public Works Director:
         (a)   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         (b)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (c)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to §
50-169. The industrial user must also be in compliance with §
50-249 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   (F)   Public Works Director may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 C.F.R. parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Public Works
Director.
   (G)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
   (H)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
   (I)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall
notify the Public Works Director within two business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Public Works
Director of the anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate.

wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on
discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this article.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-169 DILUTION.
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. Public Works
Director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-170 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
ordinance and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
50-164 of this article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state,
or Public Works Director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary
for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's
expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to Public Works Director for review, and shall be acceptable
to Public Works Director before such facilities are constructed. The review of
such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-171 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, Public Works Director may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article.
   (B)   Public Works Director may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   (C)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of Public Works Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by Public Works Director, and
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the user at their
expense.

§ 50-213 REPORTS ON COMPLIANCE WITH CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD DEADLINE.
   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to Public Works
Director a report containing the information described in §
50-190(A)(6) and (7) and §
50-211(B)(2) of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in §
50-165, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
50-224(A) of this article. All sampling will be done in conformance with §
50-221.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-214 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (Note: All SIUs are required to submit periodic compliance reports even if
they have been designated a non-significant categorical industrial user under
the provisions of §
50-214(C)).
   (A)   Except as specified in §
50-214(C), all (significant industrial) users must, at a frequency determined
by Public Works Director submit no less than twice per year (June and December
(or on dates specified)) reports indicating the nature, concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must
submit documentation required by Public Works Director or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
   (B)   The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. (See 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e) (2)). This
authorization is subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit. See §
50-190(A)(8).
      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with §
50-163, and include the certification statement in §
50-224(A) (see 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(2)(ii)).
      (5)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 C.F.R. part
136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Public Works Director
must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting
the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the
waiver must be maintained by the Public Works Director for three years after
expiration of the waiver.
      (7)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's
permit by the Public Works Director, the industrial user must certify on each
report with the statement in § 50-224(C) below, that there has been no increase
in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the industrial user.
      (8)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately; comply with the monitoring requirements of §
50-214(A), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Public
Works Director, and notify the Public Works Director.
      (9)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
   (C)   (1)   The city may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance
reports (see §
50-214(A); 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e)(1)) to a requirement to report no less
frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the (EPA/state), where the industrial user's total
categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:
         (a)   0.01 percent of the POTW's design dry-weather hydraulic
capacity, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the industrial user
discharges in batches;
         (b)   0.01 percent of the POTWs design dry-weather organic treatment
capacity; and
         (c)   0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any
pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for
which approved local limits were developed in accordance with § 50-167 of this
article.
      (2)   Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in
the last two years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in §
50-228 of this article. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an
industrial user with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the Public Works Director,
decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in
data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting
period.
      (3)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
50-224(A) of this article.
   (D)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (E)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by Public Works Director, using the procedures
prescribed in §
50-221 of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
   (F)   Users that send electronic (digital) documents to the city to satisfy
the requirements of this section must email documents that bare an electronic
signature.

§ 50-215 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Each user must notify Public Works Director of any significant changes
to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or
volume of its wastewater at least seven days before the change.
   (B)   Public Works Director may require the user to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
50-190 of this article.
   (C)   Public Works Director may issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit under § 50-200 of this article or modify an existing wastewater
discharge permit under §
50-198 of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.

§ 50-216 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify Public Works Director of the incident. This notification shall include
the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if
known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by Public Works Director, submit a detailed written report describing
the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred
as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (B), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Public Works
Director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for
a slug discharge.

§ 50-218 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
Public Works Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to Public Works Director within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city
performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city
performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was
conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this
sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-219 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
50-215 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
50-211,
50-213, and
50-214 of this article.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (A), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. § 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month; or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. § 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify Public Works Director, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued there
under, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 50-220 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and
amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA
determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
Public Works Director or other parties approved by EPA.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-221 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   (A)   Except as indicated in subsections (B) and (C) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour composite sampling techniques, unless
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by Public
Works Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge.
Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R.
part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a
24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide,
total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or
in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected
by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may
be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §§
50-211 and
50-213 (see 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must
be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, Public
Works Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by
paragraphs §
50-214 (see 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e) and (h)), the industrial user is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

§ 50-237 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   Public Works Director may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before Public Works Director and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least 30 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user as defined in §
50-163 and required by §
50-192(A). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-238 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When Public Works Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this article, and individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, Public Works Director may issue an order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a
specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-239 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When Public Works Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, Public
Works Director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-240 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When Public Works Director finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, Public Works Director may fine such user in an amount not to
exceed $25,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis.
In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall
be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 2% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1% per month. A lien against the user's property
shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
Public Works Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, Public Works Director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event
the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. Public Works Director may add
the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-241 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   Public Works Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. Public Works Director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
   (B)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, Public Works Director
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. Public Works Director may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of Public Works Director that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
50-242 of this article are initiated against the user.
   (C)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to Public Works Director prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing under §§
50-237 or
50-242 of this article.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
50-164 through
50-169 of this article.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
50-237 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by Public Works Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-243 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When Public Works Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to

§ 50-247 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS - UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection (C), below, are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to Public Works
Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-248 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS - PROHIBITED DISCHARGE
STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the individual prohibitions in §
50-164(A) of this article or the specific prohibitions in §
50-164(B)(3) through (17) of this article if it can prove that ft did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-9-2013)
§ 50-249 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS - BYPASS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
      (1)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (2)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of subsections (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   Bypass notifications.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to Public Works Director, at least ten days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to Public Works Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. Public Works Director may waive the written report
on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and Public Works Director may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C) of
this section.
      (2)   Public Works Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if Public Works Director determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (D)(1) of this section.

   A separate water bill shall be computed monthly for the consumption of water
used by each residential living unit, commercial or industrial establishment.
In those cases where a single commercial or industrial facility is being served
by more than one water meter, the consumption of all meters may be combined for
a single consumption and a single bill. In those cases where more than one
residential living unit, commercial or industrial facility is connected to a
single water meter, the total consumption shall be divided by the number of
units served in order to establish an average consumption per unit. The water
bill will then be calculated for each unit based on the calculated average
consumption. Each unit shall receive an independent water bill for monthly
service. Provided, however, nothing in this section shall prohibit the city
from multiple billing on a single utility bill.

      (1)   All water customers will be required to pay the full amount of the
bill calculated by the city, except in those instances where the water meter

has resulted in an excessive charge to the customer’s account.
      (2)   Where the customer has not been negligent by his or her failure to
repair known leaks or causes of excess water consumption, an adjustment may be
made to the customer’s bill if in the opinion of the City Manager, or his or
her official representative, an adjustment is justified; provided, however,
that no customer shall receive more than one adjustment per property in any
calendar year.
      (3)   In no event shall a billing adjustment exceed 50% of the difference
between the average of the customer’s prior three-months’ billings and the
amount of the disputed billing.
      (4)   In no event will a billing adjustment amounting to less than the
current minimum bill be made.

      (1)   The City Manager is authorized to make adjustments in the sewer
charge when a leak is determined to exist during the billing period in
question.
      (2)   The adjusted sewer bill shall be based on the average consumption
of water for the three months prior to the first month that a leak was
detected. The three-months’ average consumption shall be applied to the sewer
rate in effect at that time and the utility bill shall be adjusted accordingly.
      (3)   This sewer adjustment policy shall in no way effect or alter the
currently established policy for water adjustments, and there shall be no limit
as to the number of sewer adjustments allowed any one customer in any one year.

accountant.
